Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time is unknown; use promised lead time. Recent weekly sales show a clear upward trend through 2019-02-04 (240,251,252,269,354). To capture the recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the forecast reflects the upward shift while keeping L at default (promised=2). This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost by increasing target base-stock to cover the recent higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap parameter.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand jumped: historical samples through 2019-02-04 avg ~273, but Period 1 (2019-02-11) demand=414 and 2019-02-04=354 indicate a recent upward shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (order from P1 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 and we have only one conclude (P1 arrived=0) so no confirmed lead-time change; use default L (promised=2). To respond to the apparent demand increase without overfitting to a single extreme, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures latest 3 weeks including 269,354,414 -> higher mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the backend base-stock to improve service while the in-transit 350 partly covers upcoming demand. No carry-over lead-time change recorded due to insufficient evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time=2. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=273.2. Two recent orders (Periods 1-2) have not concluded (arrived=0) but no concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change, so do NOT change L. On-hand=0, in-transit=816 which approximately equals (1+L)*mean demand (3*273.2=819.6), so pipeline roughly covers the upcoming review+lead demand. Use default calculations: let backend use promised L=2 and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so the OR engine produces the capped base-stock balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=1149 (matches orders placed P1-P3). Recent concluded demand: P1=414, P2=399, P3=321 (mean=378). Promised lead time=2, but no arrivals observed for orders placed P1-P3 yet; still treating promised L as default for OR backend while using recent demand to capture current high demand. Set L=default to let backend assume promised lead time; set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 observed demands and reflect elevated demand; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service-level need (avoid stockouts given demand spike) against holding cost, while flagging missing arrivals in carry-over insight for future periods.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals recorded for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total in-transit=1149) \u2014 shipments delayed or possibly lost; monitor for confirmation in subsequent concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4474.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concludes show one arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 with observed lead_time=2; orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain missing (in-transit=811). Promised lead time=2; observed data supports a 2-period lead time for at least one shipment but also indicates some lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation). For demand, historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show a mean ~273.2; using default mu_hat (1+L)*mean applies (1+L) safety coverage across review+lead. sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from all samples. These choices maintain service for the upcoming (L+1) periods while avoiding explicit overcommitment given missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4); orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain missing\u2014possible lost shipments; monitor for further concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4161.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=893; historical demand shows a recent high then decline (period demands: 414,399,321,247,245). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) but several earlier orders remain missing\u2014possible lost shipments; no new conclude messages to change lead-time estimate. To respond to recent realized demand levels I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 1\u20135) so mu_hat reflects current run-rate while keeping L at promised/default. Sigma is estimated from the same recent 5 samples to capture recent volatility. This balances service (using freshest demand) against holding cost and flags that missing shipments may cause pipeline_shortfalls which the backend will try to cover via the base-stock order calculation.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand (Periods 4-6) = [247,245,265], prior peaks earlier (Periods 1-3) were higher. On-hand=0, in-transit=1123; some earlier orders (Periods 1 and 3) remain missing but a mix of observed lead times (2 and 1) indicates no single stable shift. I use a short recent window for lead time and demand: L averaged over the 2 most recent observed lead times to reflect variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 3 demand observations (most relevant recent regime) so the backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given high pipeline but zero on-hand. This avoids overreacting to older high-demand weeks while acknowledging persistent demand ~250/wk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): on-hand=0, in-transit=1123. History shows two concluded arrivals with lead_times 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6); several earlier orders remain missing. Because actual lead time appears variable and some shipments may be lost, I use calculate for L to let the backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples; with high profit/low holding (profit=$19, holding=$1) this yields a high service-level z* while default demand stats avoid overfitting to short-term noise and missing shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=29, in-transit=811; recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8)] indicating variability around the promised 2. Demand recent 5 periods = [247,245,265,331,283] (mean=274.2). To capture recent demand regime and lead-time variability I set L to recent_N (N=3) to average the last 3 observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean/volatility rather than long-ago samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover demand given variable LT) versus holding cost by grounding forecasts in the most recent 5-week demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times for recent arrivals: 2, 1, 2 (avg=1.67 over last 3 observed arrivals) \u2014 lead time variable around the promised 2; monitor for further misses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been volatile but trending around ~265 units (last 5 periods: 245,265,331,283,201). On-hand=0, in-transit=895 with several earlier orders missing/overdue (orders from P1 and P3 still not concluded) \u2014 retain precaution on lead time. Use L=recent_N (N=3) because the last 3 observed lead times are 2,1,2 (avg\u22481.67) capturing current variability. Use mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the most recent regime (last 5 demands mean=265) so (1+L) scaling will reflect review+lead demand. Use sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility for safety stock. These choices prioritize meeting demand given variable lead time while limiting excess holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than full-history averages.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand recent trend falling from mid-Feb peaks to ~130 last period; on-hand=0, in-transit=848 (some prior shipments delayed/lost). Use recent lead-time evidence (observed arrival lead_times: 1,2,1 recently) so set L by recent_N to capture variability. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 5 demands) to reflect the more recent lower-demand regime and avoid overstock; sigma as recent_N over same window to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current lower-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been elevated but variable (last 5 demands: 331,283,201,130,173; mean=223.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=949 units (some earlier orders remain missing long-term but recent concludes show arrivals with mixed lead times). Recent observed lead times vary around the promised 2 (mix of 1s and 2s); I use a short recent average to reflect this variability. I set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent realized lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasts to the most recent demand regime (covers the last 5 periods including recent spike then decline). For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices balance service (covering near-term demand given variable lead time) against holding cost by relying on recent evidence rather than the full history or an explicit inflated forecast.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has moderated vs. early seed samples; recent 5-period demand shows lower mean. I set L using a recent average (capture short-term lead-time variability). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the latest demand regime (reduces exposure to early high samples). These choices bias orders toward covering (1+L) recent demand while limiting overstock given high in-transit and low holding cost.

Demand recent three periods: 173,227,223 \u2192 recent mean \u2248207.7. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the variable but ~2\u21921.67 observed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current higher-demand regime (recent weeks ~207 avg) and recent volatility, so the backend will size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of this recent demand while capping order size to limit exposure to delayed/lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-20. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent observed: 2,1,2 => avg\u22481.67), so I use recent_N for L with N=3 to reflect the latest empirical lead-time. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 173,227,223,251) averages near ~218; use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (short window to adapt to recent high-200s weekly demand). These choices make the OR backend target a base stock that reflects the empirically shorter/variable lead time and recent elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=0, in-transit=848. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20132 periods) and some long-missing shipments earlier; no new sustained lead-time shift confirmed. To avoid overfitting to recent volatility and because promised lead time is 2, use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) to produce a stable base-stock target given noisy arrival behavior and high in-transit volume. This balances service level (protecting against stockouts given in-transit) versus holding cost sensitivity (holding cost low relative to profit).

Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1000; recent concluded lead times = 2,1,2 (avg\u22481.67) and several earlier missing arrivals suggest variable lead time with some lost shipments. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed variability around the promised 2. Demand has been elevated and fairly stable in recent weeks (Periods 11-16 demands = 173,227,223,251,267,223; recent mean \u2248227). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, which balances service (capture recent demand level) while reflecting shorter-term lead-time variability and avoiding overreaction to older data or isolated missed shipments.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=848. Recent arrivals show alternating lead times (1 or 2 periods) and no large sustained lost-shipment signal currently; pipeline substantial. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 period variability). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)-period demand estimate on the latest 5 demand observations (periods 13\u201317: 223,251,267,223,160) to adapt to recent level ~225 units/week. Volatility uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability rather than older seasonal samples. These choices aim to keep base stock responsive to recent demand while letting the OR engine account for measured lead-time behavior and avoid over-ordering given sizable in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable 1\u20132 periods (observed lead times for concluded arrivals: 2,1,2,1,2,1; avg=1.5 over 6 arrivals).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent observed lead times (concluded arrivals) = [2,1,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg 1.5 over last 6 observed arrivals and lead time is variable around promised 2. Recent demand (Periods 13\u201318) = [223,251,267,223,160,140], mean \u2248210.7; demand has declined in the last two periods but six-period window shows recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=848 \u2014 pipeline is large but contains past delayed/variable arrivals; some earlier orders were late/missing in prior periods, so use recent observed lead times rather than promised. I set L using recent_N=6 to reflect the averaged recent behavior (captures variability 1\u20132). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (use last 6 demand samples) so the (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility reflect the recent regime including the recent down-tick. These choices balance service (accounting for variable lead time) against holding cost by using a short, recent window rather than all-time higher early-season demand, avoiding excess overstock given large in-transit position.

Pipeline (848) likely includes multiple past orders with mixed arrival behavior; to be conservative on service level, I estimate lead time from the last 3 observed arrivals. Demand has softened recently (last 6 demands average ~192 units/week); I use the most recent 6 samples for mu and sigma to capture the current lower-demand regime. These choices bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of recent demand while keeping variability informed to limit excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift; use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std.

To reflect this variability I set L using the recent observed arrivals. Demand has trended down from spring peaks; to adapt while emphasizing recent lower demand I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so recent low weeks weight more but past higher weeks still contribute. Volatility has been moderate in recent arrivals, so sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture current variability. These choices help the OR backend target service (via L) while reducing excess stock from overestimating demand given many recent zero-stock periods and high in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20132 periods, recent avg ~1.5) and many missed/delayed shipments earlier; to be conservative let backend estimate L from observed history (calculate). Recent demand (last 6 periods with observed demand: P17\u2013P22 = 160,140,113,70,99,155) is substantially lower than the early-Jan samples, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduced volatility. This keeps ordered quantities aligned with recent demand while the backend computes the service-level safety stock from profit/holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=848. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2] (avg\u22481.57) indicating actual lead time clusters 1\u20132 periods around promised 2. Demand history (provided samples) will be used by default scaling. To account for variable but slightly below-2 average lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend adapts; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand mean/volatility are computed from all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (uses measured lead time) against holding cost given relatively high in-transit inventory and low holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=938. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times of 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.5) but no sustained shift beyond the promised 2; several earlier orders were delayed/missing but recent arrivals still align with promised L=2. To avoid prematurely shortening lead time and risking stockouts if shipments are delayed/lost, use the default promised lead time and let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples. This balances service (use full-sample demand estimate) against holding cost while remaining conservative about missing shipments.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen vs. earlier samples (last 5 demands avg \u2248112.6/week), and observed lead times have varied 1\u20132 periods (historical observed avg \u22481.57). To reflect persistent lower recent demand while acknowledging variable lead time, set L using calculate (avg of observed lead times) and set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N with N=5 (capturing the most recent low-demand regime). This keeps pipeline cover aligned with recent demand and limits excess holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times of 1\u20132 periods (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2; avg\u22481.57). On-hand=0, in-transit=938 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but some earlier orders were delayed/lost; nevertheless multiple concluded arrivals confirm the supplier mostly delivers in 1\u20132 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the 1\u20132 variability). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples; this balances holding cost vs service level given moderate profit/holding ratio and the confirmed variable lead time. No explicit inflation of forecast was made because pipeline inventory is large (938) and several recent arrivals indicate supply continues, reducing need for aggressive extra orders.

Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=938. Historical concluded arrivals show alternating lead times 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 (avg ~1.57). Recent demand has picked up (last 6 demands: 155,160,59,90,131,174). I set L using recent observed lead times to capture the shorter/variable pattern (recent_N, N=3). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the most recent regime where demand has risen and become more variable. These choices increase responsiveness to the recent lead-time variability and demand uptick while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=938. Recent observed lead times vary 1\u20132 (avg ~1.57 over 7 concluded arrivals) and several earlier shipments missing\u2014so use observed average lead time rather than blindly trusting promised 2. Demand has stepped down from early-year highs; recent 12-week demand shows lower mean with moderate volatility. Choose L as the calculated average of observed lead times to capture the 1\u20132 variability. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock and safety buffer to the most recent demand regime (reduces overstating demand from early high weeks). These settings help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost by matching lead-time reality and recent demand, while avoiding excess stock from outdated high-demand samples.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). SKU 399256001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=938; profit=$19/unit, holding=$1/unit/period. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (series: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2; avg\u22481.57) so I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Demand history is noisy but no clear sustained demand regime shift beyond historical samples, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices let the OR engine adjust base-stock to the empirically observed lead time while using all available demand data to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent observed demand (Periods 18\u201330) ranges ~70\u2013197/week with no sustained spike; current on-hand=0 and in-transit=938 (large pipeline) so risk is excess holding if we over-order. Historical concluded lead times are variable 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.5). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast on the most recent 12 demand observations (reflects current lower-demand regime and avoids inflating mu by early-year high weeks). Sigma uses default to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to keep base-stock aligned to recent lower demand while the large in-transit qty prevents aggressive ordering and limits holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:

To let the OR engine learn actual lead-time tendency from observed concludes, set L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has been lower recently versus early-sample baseline; use recent demand window to capture current regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses the last 6 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which aligns ordering with current demand levels and volatility while the backend balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent downward shift and avoids overstocking delayed/lost shipments.

Many earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent 6 arrivals show alternating 1\u20132 pattern; I set L to recent_N to reflect the shorter effective lead time observed recently. Demand in the last 9 concluded weeks (Periods 24\u201332) is higher and more stable than the very early sample set; I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 demand samples to capture the current regime. These parameters increase the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the more recent demand while keeping sigma informed by recent volatility, balancing service level (reduce stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) vs holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1,2; avg\u22481.57) so use a data-driven average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201333: 174,176,167,197,232,195,317) is higher and more variable than earlier periods; use a recent_N forecast to capture the current regime. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=7 to forecast (1+L)*mean of the last 7 demand samples and react to the recent uplift; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand history shows elevated weekly demand through Sept (several 200+ weeks, spike to 317 in P33). On-hand=0, in-transit=938 \u2014 pipeline large relative to recent weekly demand and likely covers multiple (1+L) periods. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2] (avg \u22481.57), so I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this keeps forecasting anchored to long-run data while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead aggregation. Rationale: calculated L captures the confirmed 1\u20132 period variability, while default demand/volatility prevents overfitting to short recent spikes and avoids excess holding given already-large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=938 \u2014 large pipeline but many earlier orders were delayed/missing; recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.5 over 6 arrivals). To reflect observed variability rather than trusting the promised fixed value, set L using calculated average of observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility will use the backend's full-sample defaults so the engine combines the historical demand series with the inferred L when computing base stock and caps.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weekly demand has been elevated (last observed demands: 218,236) vs historical samples from early 2019; on-hand=0, in-transit=938 with multiple past delayed/missing shipments (mixed observed lead times 1\u20132, some orders never concluded). Because concluded history shows variable lead time (mostly 1\u20132, avg ~1.5) but also some lost shipments, I use lead-time inference from all observed concludes (let backend compute average) rather than trusting promised L=2. To keep the backend conservative and consistent with long sample history I choose default demand and volatility calculations so base-stock uses full-sample mean/variance (backend will scale by inferred L). This balances service (covering L+1 periods of demand given variable LT) while avoiding overreacting to recent noise or potentially unreliable in-transit quantities.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=938 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past shipments were delayed/lost; recent concluded lead times are 2,1,2 (avg\u22481.67). Recent observed demand (Periods 30\u201337) shows weekly demand ~197\u2013317; I use a short recent window to capture the current demand regime. Set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time mix (1\u20132 periods). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=8) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 8 observed weekly demands, capturing the current higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to compute volatility from the same recent window. These choices balance service (accounting for variable 1\u20132 period lead times) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-ago samples that include different regimes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=938. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with recent observed sequence [2,1,2,1,2,1] (avg=1.5 over last 6). To reflect this confirmed variability (and possible past lost shipments) I set L using recent_N over the last 6 observed lead times so the OR backend uses a shorter effective lead time than the promised 2 but still accounts for variability. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use defaults to leverage full-sample demand statistics (conservative given no sustained demand regime shift). These choices aim to align pipeline targets with observed arrival behavior and let the backend compute service-level-aware base stock while avoiding unnecessary extra holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Historical weekly demand samples (seed) mean=273.2. Given multiple confirmed 1\u20132 period lead times and no strong recent demand regime shift, I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps safety stock scaled with inferred lead-time while avoiding overreaction to noisy arrivals; it leverages the large in-transit quantity to avoid excess new ordering while providing appropriate service-level buffer.

Several earlier orders were delayed/missing but recent pattern is alternating 1\u20132 periods. To reflect observed variability in lead time I let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Demand history shows no recent persistent regime shift; use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level (captures longer realized lead times via calculated L) against holding cost by not overreacting to transient spikes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand shows elevated weekly levels (last 8 weeks mean \u2248250.6) with a large spike in Period 42 (467) likely holiday-driven; promised lead time is 2 periods so use L=default. I set mu_hat explicit to cover (1+L) review+lead demand: (1+2)*~250.625 = 751.875 \u2192 rounded to 752 to give the OR engine a clear forecast that captures elevated recent demand while avoiding excessive overstock. sigma_hat kept default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history. This balances higher service level for possible holiday demand against low holding cost ($1/unit) and known variable 1\u20132 period actual lead times.

I use 'calculate' for L so the backend estimates the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variable actual lead time). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it scale forecasts/uncertainty by the inferred lead time and produce a capped order that balances service (profit/holding ratio) vs. holding cost given possible in-transit delays.

To account for the recent variability in arrivals I set L via recent_N using the last 6 observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 variability). Demand forecast and volatility use default (all-sample) estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history, providing conservative aggregate demand coverage while the adjusted L reduces risk of under-ordering given mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals.

Historical concluded lead times show consistent 1\u20132 period behavior (avg ~1.6 over 8 observed arrivals) and some lost/delayed shipments earlier, but no new sustained shift since Period 18. To balance service vs holding cost I request the optimizer infer the empirical lead time (calculate) so the backend uses observed variability rather than blindly using the promise. Demand forecasting will use the backend default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to avoid overfitting to short holiday noise given limited recent arrivals visibility.
