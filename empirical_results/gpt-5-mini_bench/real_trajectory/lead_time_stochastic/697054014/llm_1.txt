Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year) \u2014 no strong additional demand spike expected vs recent weeks. Demand analysis: recent sustained higher-demand regime since Period 30; recent 7-period average (P40\u2013P46) \u2248105 units/week; earlier P30\u2013P34 mean was ~132/wk but recent weeks settled around ~100\u2013120. Lead time & pipeline: supplier has exhibited variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and some lost shipments historically; however current system shows large in-transit = 1095 units which, if delivered, more than covers forecasted demand. Inventory/policy: required coverage = (L+1) periods = 3 periods; using conservative forecast 110 units \u2192 target pipeline+on-hand \u2248330 units. Current on-hand (88) + in-transit (1095) = 1183 > target; ordering risks large holding cost ($1/unit/period). Action: place no new order this period to avoid excess holding cost and let the substantial in-transit stock arrive and be observed to confirm true pipeline availability. Monitor arrivals next periods to reassess lead-time reliability and order if pipeline shortfall appears.",
