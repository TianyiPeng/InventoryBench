Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a womens blouse with recent weekly demand samples (132,103,92,87,80) showing a mild downward trend but only 5 samples\u2014no sustained changepoint. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=2. Profit/holding ratio is high (profit $19 vs holding $1) so target service level should be high; using defaults lets the OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean and promised L while avoiding overfitting to a small recent sample. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shifts from conclude messages (none yet).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show a modest downward trend but only 5 points (mean \u224898.8); no sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (order placed P1) \u2014 this non-arrival in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time=2; do NOT infer a lead-time change yet. Use default lead time (promised) so backend uses full (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of demand shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows stable weekly demand (mean ~98.8). Two recent conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1-2 have not arrived (arrived=0), but this is only 2 periods of delay\u2014insufficient to confirm a sustained lead-time change. To avoid overreacting to possible temporary delay, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates. Set L=default (promised 2). Use mu_hat=default so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, preserving the historical demand signal. Use sigma_hat=default so backend scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (covers review+lead demand) while avoiding excess inventory if delays are transient.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (orders placed in P1\u2013P3). No concluded arrivals observed yet \u2014 cannot infer shorter/longer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand mean = 98.8 (samples provided). Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level using historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments given no confirmed lead-time or demand regime change.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4) shows a clear upward shift vs. historical Jan samples: Period demands = [117,169,150,157] (avg 148.25) vs historical sample mean 98.8. One concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). On-hand=0, in-transit=305 (covers part of upcoming demand). I therefore set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (average observed =2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a higher base stock and appropriate safety stock while avoiding over-reliance on old low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg demand (Periods 1-4) = 148.25 vs historical sample mean = 98.8 (+49.8%), sustained over 4 periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=490. Historical concluded lead times: one observed arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Recent demand shows a sustained elevated regime in Periods 1-4 (avg=148.25) then a dip in Period5 (96). To be responsive to the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the single confirmed lead-time=2, I set L via observed average (calculate). For demand forecast I prioritize the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N with N=4) so mu_hat covers (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 periods (Periods1-4). Volatility is estimated from those same 4 recent samples (recent_N N=4) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals, while sigma_hat captures recent variability for service-level calculation.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history: observed arrivals show variable lead times (one observed 2, one observed 1). Demand showed a higher regime in Periods 1-4 but Periods 5-6 softened; overall recent behavior is best captured by focusing on the recent regime. Choose L by averaging observed lead times (let backend compute the mean of observed lead times). For demand forecast use a recent_N window to reflect the recent elevated regime while limiting noise from older historical samples: recent_N=4 (uses last 4 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) vs. holding cost given on-hand=83 and in-transit=337 (pipeline strong), and accounts for possible lead-time variability by letting backend compute average L.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) showed a sustained upward regime vs historical samples. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2), so I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect this uncertainty. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base_stock for the elevated recent demand over the (1+L) horizon while keeping variability based on the same recent window. This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given on-hand=0 and substantial in-transit=387.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand (Periods 1-4 after orders started) shows a sustained higher regime: avg=148.25 vs historical mean=98.8 (+50%). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (average 1.5) indicating mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=345 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have been inconsistent; to reflect the recent higher demand I use recent demand stats (N=4) and a recent average lead time (N=4) so the backend computes base_stock over (1+L) periods using the most relevant regime. This balances higher service level for the confirmed demand increase while letting the OR cap limit the maximum order to control holding cost given substantial in-transit units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. On-hand=0, in-transit=414 (multiple outstanding shipments; observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 mixed). Historical sample mean=98.8 but recent regime shows substantially higher demand (Periods 1-4 avg=148.25). To capture the confirmed higher demand regime while accounting for variable lead times, set L to the observed-average lead time (backend will compute average of concluded lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to focus the forecast and volatility on the new higher-demand regime (N chosen from regime length=4 per rules). This increases the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data moderates safety stock to balance profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand shows a previously recorded sustained uplift (Periods 1-4 avg=148.25 vs historical 98.8) but more recent 6-period average has moderated. On-hand=25, in-transit=306 (large pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods); no clearly lost shipments but observed lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (balances early high spike and more moderate recent weeks). Sigma also recent_N N=6 to reflect current volatility. These choices ensure the backend targets service given observed lead-time variability while avoiding overreacting to a short-lived spike, and the large in-transit inventory reduces the immediate need to order aggressively.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical (carry-over noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations: observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1} \u2192 mixed 1\u20132 periods, average 1.5. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed mean lead time. Given significant pipeline and elevated demand but no new sustained changepoints, use default demand/volatility rules so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (captures increased mean via L-adjusted aggregation) while default sigma avoids overreacting to recent noise and prevents excessive holding given holding cost=$1.0 and profit=$19.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been elevated vs the older sample set (sustained higher mean since Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=428 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; recent average used to reflect this variability. I set L via recent_N over the last 6 observed lead-time conclusions (captures alternating 1/2 pattern). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (all available recent periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand signal while the pipeline position (428) will cap orders from the OR engine, limiting over-ordering and balancing holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=394. Observed concluded lead times show variability (sequence of observed lead times ~ [2,1,2,1,2,1,2]) suggesting actual lead time ~1.6 recently. Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 98,84,123,125,89) averages ~103.8, slightly above historical baseline. To balance service (profit $19) vs holding ($1), I use a recent-average lead time to reflect observed variability and recent demand/volatility to adapt to the modestly elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory given large in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg=1.625); recent pattern (last 5 observed = [1,2,1,2,2], avg=1.6) suggests actual lead time < promised but variable. Demand shows a sustained upward regime (Periods 1-4 recent avg=148.25 vs historical mean=98.8). To balance service and holding cost: set L by recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent lead-time mix; set mu_hat by recent_N (N=4) to capture the detected recent higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat by recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that raises targets for the new higher-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering against occasional shorter lead times.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-15) averaging ~119 units/week, current on-hand=0 and large pipeline in-transit=380. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2 periods); use an empirical average to capture that variability and avoid systematically under/over-ordering. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (~1.67). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, leveraging the full history while the averaged L reflects mixed lead-time behavior and the large in-transit stock reduces short-term ordering urgency.

Demand history shows earlier higher bursts but recent periods are variable; no new sustained demand regime beyond prior insight, so use default (1+L)\xd7mean historical samples for mu_hat and default volatility scaling for sigma_hat. This balances service (using observed average lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Observed concluded lead times (from history) = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1], avg=1.6 \u2192 use calculated lead time to reflect recent mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals. Recent demand shows no new sustained regime since the prior carry-over; therefore use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (using measured lead time) against holding cost by not overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Historical arrivals show actual lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods with no sustained shift beyond promised; therefore keep L = promised to avoid overreacting. Recent demand has moderated versus the early-period spike noted in carry-over insight; to keep the forecast responsive to recent weeks I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) for mu_hat. Sigma retained as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by review+lead. These choices balance service (using recent demand to avoid overstock) while leaving lead time at promised given mixed arrival evidence and substantial pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
2019-06-24: on-hand=8, in-transit=327. Observed lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2); demand has recent variation but prior carry-over flagged a sustained higher regime earlier. To reflect freshest data while smoothing noise, I use recent_N with N=6 for lead time, demand mean, and demand std so the OR backend builds base_stock from the most recent 6 observations (captures recent regime while averaging short-term noise) and avoids overreacting to single-period spikes or missing shipments. Large pipeline means we do not need aggressive uplift beyond recent demand-driven forecast.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent realized demand has fallen in late periods (P17-20 demands = 55,62,42,30) versus earlier higher regime; to capture current lower demand I use a short recent window. Set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the backend accounts for actual variability (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid overweighting older high-demand weeks. Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given large in-transit and lower recent demand while letting the OR engine compute service-level-aware base stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (mixture of 1 and 2); use aggregate average (calculate) to let backend infer actual mean lead time. Recent demand has been materially lower than the early high-demand burst; use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture current regime (periods 17-21 demand = 55,62,42,30,39 -> avg ~45.6) so mu_hat reflects present demand over review+lead. Volatility appears moderate recently; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep orders aligned to current demand while the large in-transit position prevents over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 or 2) \u2014 recent average lead time shorter than promised. Recent demand has fallen sharply since mid-Period 17. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the 1\u20132 period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 17\u201322) to reflect the new, lower demand regime (reduces overstocking risk given large pipeline). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to match recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock to avoid high holding cost on the large in-transit position while aligning safety stock to observed recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg decreased from 148.25 (Periods 1-4 recent high) to 43.5 (Periods 17-22) (-70.6%)

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime is the low regime identified in carry-over: Periods 17-23 demand series = [55,62,42,30,39,33,37], recent mean \u224841.1 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 units \u2014 pipeline well above (1+L)\xd7recent demand (with promised L=2, (1+L)*41.1\u2248123), so no emergency replenishment needed. Observed concluded lead times have been 1\u20132 periods with no sustained shift, so use promised lead time. To align OR backend forecasts with the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last N=7 samples (the detected low-demand regime length) so the base-stock and cap reflect the current lower mean and volatility and avoid excess holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 17 (periods 17-24 mean \u2248 42.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 but many expected arrivals have not concluded recently; however concluded history shows actual lead times of 1\u20132 only. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals do not confirm a longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the low-demand regime spanning Periods 17\u201324; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias the base-stock toward the lower recent demand, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service for the observed lower demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime that started at Period 17: recent weekly demands from P17\u2013P25 average ~42 units (sustained 9 periods). No concluded arrivals since Period 19, so cannot confirm a lead-time change \u2014 use promised lead time. To reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime, set demand estimates using the most recent N=9 samples (Periods 17\u201325). Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty to the current low-demand regime while keeping L at the contracted promise to avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg \u22481.55) so use calculated average to capture actual lead-time behavior. Demand dropped at Period 17 and the recent regime (Periods 17\u201326) avg demand \u224840 units; use recent_N with N=10 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating mean/variance from older high-demand periods while the calculated L helps the OR backend size pipeline to cover the true observed lead-time; this balances service (avoid stockouts given 327 in-transit) against holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand (Periods 23-27) = [37,40,39,63,96], avg=55. Pipeline shows 327 in-transit with on-hand=0; several past orders did not conclude promptly suggesting lost/delayed arrivals but concluded lead times historically =1\u20132. To avoid overreacting to missing shipments while reflecting the lower recent demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods (captures current lower demand without diluting with older high regime). This balances service (use recent demand) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has lifted: periods 26-28 = [63,96,69], avg=76.0 vs prior low-regime avg (Periods 17-22)=43.5 (+75%). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline arriving later or possibly lost delays). Observed lead times in concluded history alternate 1\u20132 periods; use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand forecast uses the most recent confirmed regime (Periods 26-28) so set mu_hat as recent_N with N=3; sigma_hat uses recent volatility over same 3-period regime to reflect increased variance. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent uptick while keeping lead-time estimate data-driven; using recent_N for demand avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand samples, and calculate for L lets the backend infer the typical 1\u20132 period delivery pattern despite some delayed/lost shipments in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg demand (Periods 26-28)=76.0 vs prior regime avg (Periods 17-22)=43.5 (+74.6%), sustained 3 periods

Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the verified recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (the 4-period recent regime) so (1+L)-scaled demand and volatility reflect current higher demand while keeping L estimated from observed history. This balances higher service level needs against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Recent demand has shifted up since Period 26 (recent demands Periods 26\u201330 = [63,96,69,76,103]; recent average \u224881). To capture the newest regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock to the current higher-demand regime while backend enforces caps and promised lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0 with in-transit=327 (many in-transit units have not concluded), suggesting delayed arrivals but per rules I only infer lead time from concluded arrivals. Observed concluded lead times (from history) average \u22481.55, so I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical mean. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the recent regime length) so the (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility reflect the current higher-demand regime. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by not over-weighting older low-demand history.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (many undelivered units visible in pipeline). Concluded arrivals show no sustained lead-time change (recent observed lead_times = 1\u20132); therefore use promised lead time (default). Demand has risen since the low regime (Periods 17\u201322). Recent periods (starting ~Period 26) show higher and variable demand; I treat the current regime as the most recent 7 periods (Periods 27\u201333 window of observed demands including Period 32=125) to capture the uplift and recent volatility. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the new higher mean while accounting for recent variability; this balances service (capture uplift) vs holding cost given holding is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent observed demands (Periods 30-33) = [103,132,125,184] show a clear uptick vs prior regime (Periods 26-28 avg=76). On-hand=0, in-transit=362 (many units currently pipeline but arrivals not yet concluded in history). I retain promised lead time (use default) because concluded arrivals do not establish a different sustained lead time. For demand I target the new higher regime using recent_N on the last 4 observed demand periods to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the spike (N=4 meets the 3+ periods sustained-change rule). This raises the base-stock to protect service level given strong recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: avg demand Periods 30-33 = 136.0 vs prior recent avg Periods 26-28 = 76.0 (+79%), sustained 4 periods

Recent concluded history shows actual lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) so use calculated average lead time; demand exhibits a sustained upward regime starting Period 30 (Periods 30-33 avg=136 over prior lower regimes). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=4) to capture the higher demand level and volatility so the OR backend raises base stock while avoiding excess holding given holding cost is low ($1) vs profit ($19). This also accounts for the large in-transit volume which the backend will offset against pipeline when computing orders.

Lead-times historically mixed (1\u20132) but latest concluded arrival shows a 3-period lead (ordered P32 arrived P35); use calculated average of observed lead times so backend infers current mean. To prioritize service during this high-demand regime while controlling holding cost, I use a recent-window demand estimate (4 periods) for both mu and sigma so the base-stock reflects the recent elevated mean and volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent conclude messages show two consecutive arrivals with lead_time=3 (orders on Period 32 arrived Period 35; order on Period 33 arrived Period 36), indicating actual lead time has shifted up from promised 2 to 3. Recent demand is high (Periods 33-36: 184,119,99,177) \u2014 a short rolling window captures current elevated regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent, elevated demand regime. Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture higher recent demand and longer lead time) while keeping holding cost in mind by limiting the recent window rather than using the full historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (orders: Period 32\u2192arrived Period 35; Period 33\u2192arrived Period 36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime since Period 30 is elevated (Periods 30-37 avg \u2248 136+ high spikes) and in-transit is large (697 units) while on-hand is 0. Lead time has been observed as 3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35 and P33\u2192P36), so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized supplier delay. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201337) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the longer lead time and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap formula to limit excess inventory given the large in-transit volume.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 30 (weeks 30-38 demand high and volatile). Lead time has been observed as 3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36); use explicit L=3 to reflect realized supplier behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the elevated recent mean over Periods 30-38. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under the confirmed longer lead time while using recent data to avoid underordering given sustained higher demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=532. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple 3-period observations in the last 8 concludes; averaging the most recent observed lead times avoids overreacting to a single late/early arrival while recognizing a trend toward longer shipments. Demand has rebounded recently (Periods 36-39 demands = 177,135,127,108; recent mean ~136.75) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current higher-demand regime. Choices: L set by recent_N to average the last 4 observed lead times (captures the recent mix of 3s and a 1); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to scale forecast and volatility to the current demand regime. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping sigma aligned with recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit exposure.

Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 177,135,127,108,90) is higher than earlier low regime; use recent data to capture current volatility. Choose L as recent_N (N=3) to weight the confirmed 3-period lead-time observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime (Periods 36-40), so the OR engine stocks for the current higher mean and observed variability while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=471. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (confirmed P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36 and recorded insight at Period 37). Demand has been elevated since Period 30; mean of Periods 32-41 = 123.6. Given confirmed LT=3 and recent higher demand, I set L explicitly to 3 so the backend plans across the correct pipeline. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat so the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast reflects the recent regime (backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent). I also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to preserve service (profit/holding implies high service quantile) while using recent data to avoid underforecasting from older low-demand samples.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,3,2) \u2192 average \u22481.87; I therefore let backend calculate L from observed lead times. Demand has shown recent higher variability since Period 30; to capture current regime I use a recent_N forecast using the last 9 concluded demand periods (Periods 34\u201342) for mean and volatility so the base-stock targets service during the (1+L) review+lead window while limiting excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=611. Historical conclude messages (Periods 35\u201336 arrivals for orders at P32\u2013P33) and carry-over confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Pipeline (611) is large relative to recent weekly demand spikes (several weeks >100) so we keep a longer lead-time estimate to avoid underordering when late arrivals occur. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures recent high-variance weeks Oct\u2013Nov) so the OR backend\u2019s base-stock raises service while capping orders via its cap. This balances profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by using recent demand signal rather than long-term average given recent regime shifts and confirmed longer lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=620 \u2014 pipeline large but many past shipments showed extended delays. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 (Period32\u219235, 33\u219236). To be conservative vs promised L=2, set explicit L=3. Demand recent weeks (Periods 40-44 = 90,72,178,93,116) show elevated and variable December demand; use recent_N=5 to capture current level and volatility for review+lead forecasting. These settings cause the OR backend to size base-stock for a 4-period coverage (1+L) using the recent mean and std, balancing higher service need in season vs low holding cost (holding=$1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Historical lead-time observations (Periods 32\u219235, 33\u219236) confirmed actual lead time = 3; several later arrivals also follow 3. On-hand=42, in-transit=480 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed longer lead time use explicit L=3 so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period forecast correctly. For demand forecast, I use the most recent 4 weeks where demand is high and representative (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current regime and pipeline size, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed lead time rather than promised 2. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since ~Period 30 (see carry-over); to capture this recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 17 periods to reflect current mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This raises target base-stock to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while avoiding stockouts given longer lead time and elevated demand. No new shipment-loss signals detected.
