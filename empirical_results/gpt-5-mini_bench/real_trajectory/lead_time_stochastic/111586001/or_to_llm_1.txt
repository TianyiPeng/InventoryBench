Inventory check: on-hand=0, in-transit=981 (some of which may be delayed or partially lost historically). Demand outlook: recent 4-week demand (Periods 43\u201346) = [197,319,475,462], avg=363.25/week; this reflects a sustained high-demand regime vs earlier months. Using a (L+1)=3 period coverage target (current period demand occurs after decision), forecast demand = 3 * 363.25 = 1089.75 units. Pipeline covers ~981 units, so uncapped order_raw \u2248 1089.75 \u2212 981 = 108.75 \u2248109 units. Given known pipeline unreliability (prior lost/delayed shipments) I add a modest buffer (~10%) to mitigate lost-shipment risk and lead-time variability, rounding to a whole unit. Final decision: order 120 units to target ~3-period coverage while protecting against partial pipeline losses. I deviate from OR's 0 recommendation because OR ignores recent regime spike and observed lead-time irregularity; OR's base-stock (which would use older samples and promised L) underestimates current demand and pipeline risk.",
