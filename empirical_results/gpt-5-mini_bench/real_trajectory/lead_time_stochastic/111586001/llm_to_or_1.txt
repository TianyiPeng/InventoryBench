Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248106.6 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods and no evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts, so use defaults to let OR backend compute base-stock consistent with historical demand and promised L. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding, avoiding premature manual adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=144 (order placed Period 1) but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical demand samples (used by default) show mean \u2248106.6/week; Period 1 demand=147 is a single higher observation (not yet a sustained changepoint). Promised lead time remains 2. To be conservative and avoid overreacting to one high demand week, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the long-run sample mean and std. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for more concluded arrival/demand data to detect any regime shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand shows an uptick (Period1=147, Period2=178) versus earlier Jan samples (68\u2013116). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time; continue using promised lead time. To capture the apparent demand rise while remaining conservative, I use a recent_N=3 demand window (last 3 weeks: 178,147,116) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default lead time (promised=2). This raises the (1+L)-scaled forecast to respond to higher demand while sigma from recent_N captures current volatility and limits overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=106.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=441 (sum of orders P1:144, P2:157, P3:140) but no arrivals have concluded for those orders despite promised L=2 \u2014 indicating shipments are delayed or lost. Because there are 3 consecutive orders with no concluded arrivals, I set L explicitly longer to protect against under-ordering if lead time has stretched. I use L explicit=4 to cover a longer pipeline horizon; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample) formulas so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set, balancing service level versus holding cost given high uncertainty about arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >2 periods or shipments delayed/lost: orders from Periods 1-3 (144,157,140) have not concluded by Period 4; in-transit=441.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows Period2 order (157) arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed lead_time=2 for that shipment. On-hand=28, in-transit=462 but prior orders from P1 and P3 remain unconcluded (possible lost/delayed). I therefore trust observed lead time=2 and use the backend's calculate/default demand formulas: set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). For demand, use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture historical weekly mean (samples: 68,109,126,114,116) and use default sigma to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 moderate z) against holding cost while acknowledging some shipments may be lost; if further missing arrivals persist I'll revise lead-time inference.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4, lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=462 (from prior orders). Historical concluded lead time evidence: Period2 order arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed lead_time=2. Recent demand samples (periods 1-5): [147,178,141,129,107]. Pipeline plus expected arrivals should cover (1+L) demand; using confirmed average lead time keeps OR backend aligned with observed arrivals. Choices: set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm promised L=2; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) because no sustained demand regime shift (>=3 periods) is clearly established and sample size is small.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (several prior orders outstanding). Historical recent demands (Periods 1-6): [147,178,141,129,107,139] -> recent mean \u2248140, sustained over 6 periods. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4). I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the new, higher-demand regime; this raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and captures recent volatility to balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding=$1/unit (neutral unit economics).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent Periods 1-6 avg demand \u2248140 vs earlier sample avg \u2248106 (+32%), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted higher: Periods 1-6 (P1=147,P2=178,P3=141,P4=129,P5=107,P6=139) show a sustained higher regime (~140 avg) vs earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (covers some future demand but arrivals recently have been sparse; one observed lead time=2). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (observed avg=2). For demand, I use recent_N (N=6) so mu_hat reflects the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 periods). For volatility, I use recent_N (N=6) to capture recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while using recent variability to set safety stock, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding so critical ratio=0.5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=462 (orders from P1,P3,P4 still not concluded) \u2014 P2 confirmed lead_time=2 (arrived P4). Evidence: demand has shifted up and been sustained (Periods 3-8 recent demands: 141,129,107,139,166,112 \u2014 recent regime avg \u2248140 vs earlier ~106; sustained signal noted in history). Many earlier orders remain in-transit beyond promised LT, suggesting lost/delayed shipments; however observed lead times average 2 where concluded. Therefore use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times =2). To capture the higher recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, improving service while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory given missing shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has stepped up vs earlier samples: recent demands (Periods 4-9) = [129,107,139,166,112,131], recent avg \u2248134 vs earlier sample avg \u2248106 (~+27%), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (large pipeline) \u2014 some earlier orders were delayed but Period 4 concluded confirmed an actual lead time=2. I use L=default (promised 2) consistent with confirmed observation. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) so mu_hat reflects the new higher regime over the last 6 periods (multiplied by 1+L in backend). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the backend cap limit orders given the large in-transit pipeline, balancing service-level and holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (sum of outstanding orders). Historical concluded lead times show a confirmed 2-period lead (Period2 order arrived in Period4), but several earlier orders remain missing in-transit\u2014so keep the lead-time estimate driven by observed concludes. Recent demand regime elevated: Periods 1-6 average \u2248140 (sustained for 6 periods). To capture the new regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6-period regime. Choices: L by "calculate" to use observed lead times (confirmed =2); mu_hat "recent_N" N=6 to forecast with the elevated recent mean across review+lead; sigma_hat "recent_N" N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base_stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping lead-time estimate tied to observed concludes to avoid overreacting to missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent periods show higher demand (~140 avg over recent 6) vs earlier sample (~106). To capture the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility). I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) so the OR backend uses the contractual lead time; using recent_N demand estimates balances service level (higher demand) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand (Periods 7-12) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier history (periods 7-12 mean \u2248120.8 vs earlier ~106, +~14%); confirmed actual lead time evidence: Period2 order arrived in Period4 \u2192 lead_time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (multiple older orders in transit; some earlier orders likely lost but one confirmed LT=2). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times rather than the promise. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new regime (Periods 7-12) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This focuses the base-stock on the sustained higher demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering given past missing arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (earlier carry-over: avg \u2248140 over recent 6 periods vs earlier \u2248106, +32%). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (use concluded arrivals only to infer lead time; no new concluded arrivals recently). I keep L as default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (N chosen = observed regime length 6). These parameters steer the OR backend toward higher base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while capturing recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded lead time observations confirm promised L=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Recent demands have been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Using default lead time and default demand stats (leveraging full sample history) keeps the OR backend anchored to long-run demand and avoids overreacting to recent volatility; in-transit inventory provides multi-period cover so no explicit inflation of mu_hat is needed.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning around Periods 1-6 (recent avg \u2248140 vs earlier \u2248106, noted previously). I keep L at the promised/default (2) because concluded evidence supports promised LT and there are no new contradictory conclude messages. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (regime length = 6 periods as recorded) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the last 6 demand samples. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service during the higher-demand regime while keeping volatility estimates recent so the capped-order cap moderates order size given large in-transit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (large pipeline from prior orders, some previously overdue). Observed lead-time evidence: Period4 conclude shows Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 => actual lead time consistent with 2. Recent demand has declined vs the earlier elevated regime; last 6 concluded periods (P11\u2013P16) demand = [103,113,124,83,58,25], so I use a recent 6-period estimate to capture the current lower demand level and volatility. Choices: L set via calculate to reflect observed lead times (2); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) so the OR backend sizes the (1+L) forecast to current demand regime, avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent weeks show demand falling from earlier high levels (past 6\u201310 weeks variable), but no new sustained regime shift confirmed (recent low weeks may be noise). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 which likely covers multiple future periods. Promised lead time = 2 and prior concluded evidence supports LT=2, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping decisions anchored to long-run data while the large pipeline provides buffer against short-term volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Recent demand has dropped in the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 14-18: 83,58,25,37,29) versus earlier higher regime; I therefore target forecasts to the most recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised lead time=2) consistent with confirmed observation. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the last 5 weeks' demand pattern, reducing overstock risk given the sustained decline. This balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Historical concluded lead time evidence: one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Recent demand has fallen materially since Period 13. I set L=calculate to use the observed lead-time history (backend will average observed lead times, currently supporting promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 13\u201319) because a clear, sustained regime change began at Period 13; this keeps orders aligned to the current lower demand and avoids overstock given holding cost equals profit. Sigma set recent_N N=7 to reflect volatility in the recent low-demand regime. These choices reduce excess ordering against the persistent drop in demand while respecting confirmed lead-time evidence and the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand P1\u2013P12 = 130.5 vs avg demand P13\u2013P19 = 53.0 (\u221259%), sustained for 7 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13 (P13\u2013P20 mean \u224847/week); earlier higher-demand regime ended. On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals have been irregular historically; only one concluded lead_time observed=2). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (P13\u2013P20) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime: mu_hat uses the (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 8 to reflect reduced variability. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the new low-demand regime while accounting for the 2-period lead time and the observed pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Observed on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Concluded arrivals show lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4); many earlier orders remain in-transit but not concluded\u2014may be delayed/lost, but no sustained evidence the lead time changed. Demand has clearly fallen since Period 13 (sustained low demand P13\u2013P21); use recent data to capture the lower regime. Therefore: set L to default (promised 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 13\u201321) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand and volatility appropriate for the new low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Promised lead time=2; concluded arrivals (Period4 showed Period2 order arrived in Period4) confirm actual lead time=2, so use default lead time. Demand shows a sustained downshift starting Period 13 (P13\u2013P22 = 10 samples, lower mean ~53 vs earlier ~130); I will base demand forecast on the most recent regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the 10-period low-demand regime) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from these recent samples. This reduces overstock risk given low recent demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 13 (avg ~53) versus earlier higher levels; on-hand=0, in-transit=462 (some prior shipments may be lost but lead time has been observed as 2 in past concluded data). To avoid overstocking given profit=holding= $1 and the prolonged low-demand regime, I set L to promised (default) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime. Using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most recent 11 periods (Period13\u201323) where demand has been consistently lower, keeping safety stock and mean demand aligned with the new regime and reducing holding cost risk.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 13 (sustained ~5\u2013124 then mostly low; P13\u2013P24 show persistently lower demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead time so far = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded evidence confirms promised LT and no sustained change since. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (use last 12 periods P13\u2013P24) to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overweighting earlier high-demand samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR backend focused on the recent low-demand regime while using the promised LT; large in-transit already provides coverage so the backend will cap orders appropriately to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 13 (sustained lower mean through Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 but many early orders never concluded (some shipments likely lost/delayed). Lead-time evidence from concluded history: observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence. For demand I use recent_N=13 (Periods 13\u201325) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime for the (1+L)-period forecast; same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock near the recent mean (profit=holding so service/holding tradeoff favors mean demand) and avoids overstocking given low sustained demand and uncertain in-transit reliability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (many prior orders remain undelivered). Observed concluded lead times show a confirmed 2-period arrival (Period2\u2192Period4) and no sustained evidence of a new longer lead time; therefore set L by 'calculate' (uses observed lead times \u2192 2). Demand dropped sharply at Period 13 and has remained low for 14 periods (Periods 13\u201326, mean demand \u224833.6). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (captures the 14-period low-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_recent). This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given uncertain in-transit shipments and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows a confirmed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Demand experienced a sustained downshift beginning around Period13; recent weeks (Periods 21\u201327) show low but variable demand (4,13,12,5,15,45,79). I therefore keep L as default (promised 2). To reflect the recent low-demand regime while capturing the recent uptick and volatility, I use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on Periods 21\u201327). This biases the forecast toward current lower mean/observed variance so the OR engine will target lower base-stock while allowing for recent variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime vs early-year (recent 5-week avg \u224840 units vs earlier ~130). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks at current demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods and no new lost-shipment signals, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean/vol to reflect the new low-demand regime (captures weeks 24\u201328: 5,15,45,79,56) so mu_hat and sigma_hat align the base-stock to current demand and avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding. This balances service vs holding by sizing replenishment to recent lower demand while acknowledging existing large in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 but many past orders failed to conclude after Period 4; only confirmed observed lead time is 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (sustained ~53 units). To avoid excess holding cost vs $1 profit, set lead time based on observed arrivals (average observed = 2) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime. Chosen: L='calculate' to use average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 13\u201329) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and recent volatility, which reduces recommended base stock and caps orders to limit holding cost given uncertain in-transit shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). History shows actual lead time confirmed at 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting Period13, so I use recent demand to reflect the current low-regime while covering review+lead. Set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirms 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=18 (most recent regime length \u224818 periods from Period13\u201330) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are driven by current lower-demand behavior; this reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded lead time evidence confirms lead time=2 in earlier periods; no new multi-period lead-time change. Recent demand (Periods 25-31) shows higher activity including two large spikes (P30=147,P31=203), so I bias the forecast to recent weeks. I set L=default to use promised lead time (no strong evidence to override). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand samples, Periods 25\u201331) so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. This uses pipeline (462) implicitly in ordering calculation to avoid over-ordering given substantial in-transit units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 shows Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 -> observed avg lead_time=2. Recent demand has shifted up in the last 3 periods (P30\u2013P32: 147,203,215) \u2014 a new high-demand regime of length 3. To react quickly I set L by calculate (uses observed lead times -> 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the emerging high-demand regime; same for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the uptick while the large in-transit pipeline (462) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand P30\u2013P32 = 188.33 (147,203,215), sustained 3 periods; treat as new higher-demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=565 (large pipeline from prior orders, last order P33=103 still in-transit). Recent demand regime is the higher regime starting at Period 30 (demands P30\u2013P33 = 147,203,215,344; recent elevated mean). Promised lead time 2 was confirmed earlier (Period2\u2192arrived Period4), and recent single arrivals not yet concluded are within expectation given L=2. I set L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses P30\u2013P33). For volatility I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect current variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to meet the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline plus capped ordering will limit over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has spiked starting Period 30 (147,203,215,344,311) \u2014 a sustained high-demand regime across the last 5 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=682 units (some recently ordered shipments are still en route). Promised lead time was 2 and historically confirmed as 2; I therefore use the default promised L to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set demand forecasts using recent_N over the last 5 periods (regime length=5 \u2192 N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the new higher mean and volatility. These parameters help the OR backend raise the target stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping variance-based safety stock consistent with recent variability. No new evidence of a persistent lead-time change or lost shipments beyond prior notes, so no explicit L adjustment.

Several recent orders (P33\u2013P35) have not concluded yet; using conservative promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 30\u201335). Sigma likewise uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These params raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while using promised lead time the OR engine expects.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders from Periods 33\u201335 (103, 117, 50) not concluded by Period 35; possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=616. Recent arrivals show variable lead times (observed: P2->P4=2, P33->P36=3, P35->P36=1) so I let backend calculate an empirical average lead time. Demand has jumped sharply since Period 30 (P30\u2013P36 demands = [147,203,215,344,311,317,266], n=7). I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a (review+lead) forecast reflecting the new high-demand regime while the backend's capped ordering prevents extreme single-period overorders. These choices balance higher service needs (capture surge) against holding cost and the observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand P30\u2013P36 = 257.57 (n=7) vs prior avg P1\u2013P29 = 76.72 (+235.0%), sustained 7 periods; treat as new high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=773 (large pipeline; recent orders P33\u2013P35 had mixed arrivals indicating variable lead times). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P33->P36=3, P35->P36=1 \u2192 average \u22482. Demand has shifted to a sustained high regime since Period 30 (recent P30\u2013P36 avg \u2248257). Set L by calculating the average observed lead time to capture variable actual LT. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the confirmed high-demand regime (uses most recent 7 samples P30\u2013P36). Use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in that same recent high-demand window. These choices prioritize service during a sustained high-demand regime while acknowledging observed LT variability and large in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (many weeks of 147\u2013344 demand) so forecast should use recent samples. Observed concluded lead times are variable (recent concluded lead_times = 2,3,1,1); average \u22481.75 so use a recent-average L to capture variability. I set L using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the last 4 observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the high-demand regime from Period 30\u201338 (regime length=9). These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering if effective lead time is shorter.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: recent observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 3 (P33->P36), 1 (P35->P36), 1 (P37->P38)]; average \u22481.75; treat lead time as unstable.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 (many weeks of 147\u2013344 demand) and substantial pipeline in-transit (770) with varied observed lead times. Observed concluded lead_times = [2,3,1,1,3] => average ~2; choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=10 to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201339) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects recent elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for the new regime while relying on observed lead-time average to avoid over/under-ordering given large in-transit volume.

On-hand=0, in-transit=810 (large pipeline). To capture the confirmed high-demand regime I set L by calculation (uses observed lead times), and base demand and volatility on the most recent 7 periods (P30\u2013P36) to reflect the new higher demand and higher variance; this balances higher service needs against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Lead time has been variable recently (observed lead_times = [2,3,1,1,3,2]); use recent average to capture instability. Set L via recent_N on last 6 observed lead times. For demand estimate use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Period 30\u201341, n=12) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=12 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the new high demand while accounting for variable lead time and high in-transit inventory to avoid underordering if some shipments are lost.

Use calculated L from observed concluded lead-times to let backend capture instability; use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated demand regime (captures P32\u2013P43 window including the spike periods). This ensures base_stock targets the high-demand regime while sigma uses recent volatility; in-transit 828 likely covers multiple review+lead periods but shipments have been variable, so relying on recent demand samples is safer to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=744. Historical concluded lead times show high variability (examples: 2,3,1,1,3,2,3,2) so use calculated average lead time. Demand has clearly shifted to a sustained high regime starting Period 30 (many large weekly demands P30\u2013P43); use a recent_N forecast based on that regime to capture current elevated mean and volatility. Using L=calculate lets backend infer average observed lead time; mu_hat recent_N (N=14) uses the last 14 demand samples (P30\u2013P43) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean for the review+lead period; sigma_hat recent_N (N=14) captures recent volatility. This balances service (meeting high recent demand) against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the confirmed high-demand regime and observed lead-time behavior, while relying on the backend cap to limit extreme orders given pipeline of 744 units.

Observed lead times are variable but average \u22482.125 (use backend 'calculate' to capture observed mean). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 15 periods (P30\u2013P44, regime length=15). Sigma also uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These settings balance service (avoid stockouts in peak season) against holding cost by basing target stock on the recent high-demand regime and an empirically averaged lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 \u2014 large pipeline but lead time has been variable recently (observed lead_times include 1,2,3). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 30 (many weeks of 147\u2013475), with extreme spikes in Dec (Periods 43\u201345). I choose to let backend calculate L from observed concluded lead times to reflect recent variability (method: calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 30\u201345, n=16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and holiday spike (helps raise the base stock to avoid stockouts despite volatile arrivals). Using recent demand stats for both mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level (capture current high mean and volatility) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 43\u201345 demands = 197, 319, 475 (sustained high demand into December); treat as holiday/high-demand regime.

Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand is in a sustained high/holiday regime: Periods 42\u201346 demands = 355,197,319,475,462 (strong spike; last 5 avg \u2248 362 units). On-hand=0 but in-transit=874 units (sufficient to cover multiple weeks of current high demand). Lead times have been variable (observed 1\u20133 periods); to account for that variability I let the backend compute average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the current holiday/high-demand regime and its volatility; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect elevated variability. These choices raise the base-stock to service high holiday demand while relying on large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.
