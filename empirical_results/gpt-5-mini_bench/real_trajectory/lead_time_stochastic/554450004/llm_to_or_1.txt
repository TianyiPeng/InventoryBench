Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 78.6 and std ~7.23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown; promised lead time (2) used. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std: this yields a base-stock reflecting three-period demand (review+lead) and modest safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service vs holding cost given no evidence of regime or lead-time change and no pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=92 (ordered in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time is 2 periods and an order placed in Period 1 would be expected to arrive during Period 3, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment yet. Historical weekly demand mean = 78.6 (samples: 72,81,71,78,91) but Period 1 demand spike to 126 is a single observation \u2014 not enough to declare a regime shift. To avoid overreacting to one high-demand period and because we have in-transit units, use the defaults (promised L and full-sample demand stats) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (capture baseline demand) against holding cost while awaiting confirmed evidence of a demand or lead-time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded demands (Period1=126, Period2=126) are well above Jan historical weekly mean (~78), indicating a likely upward demand regime. However this is only 2 confirmed high-demand periods (insufficient to record a sustained carry-over insight). Promised lead time remains 2 and cannot be re-estimated from unseen arrivals, so use default L. To adapt quickly to higher recent demand while keeping variance estimation local, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 3 samples (Periods: P2=126, P1=126, 2019-02-04=91) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over that window. This raises the base-stock to better cover the apparent demand increase while the capped order cap will limit extreme ordering.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (orders from P1-P3); none have concluded\u2014shipments overdue relative to promised L=2 so I assume effective lead time is longer. Recent observed customer demand (Periods 1-3) = [126,126,104], substantially above historical pre-sample mean (~78). To cover review+lead horizon and protect service while shipments are delayed, I set L explicitly to 3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses mean and std of the last 3 observed demands scaled by (1+L)). This increases replenishment targets to avoid stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1), so prioritizing service is warranted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 1-3 demand avg=118.7 vs historical avg\u224878 (+52%); treat as new sustained higher-demand regime

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=35, in-transit=380. Concluded history shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2) so actual lead time matches promised 2. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4: 126,126,104,86) is materially above historical sample mean (~78), and prior carry-over flagged a sustained higher-demand regime. I therefore keep L at the default (promised=2) and set demand forecasts using the most recent regime to capture elevated mean/variance: use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 1-4). This raises the base_stock to cover the higher observed demand over the review+lead period while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to maintain service with minimal lost sales; using recent samples avoids over-weighting older low-demand history.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has shifted higher vs. historical Jan samples: Periods 1-5 demand = [126,126,104,86,89], mean=106.2 (vs historical ~78). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders were delayed before (Period2 arrival confirmed lead_time=2). I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded messages confirm 2-period arrivals and no sustained lead-time increase. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the elevated average; matching sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) lets the backend size safety stock to recent volatility. These settings balance service level (respond to higher observed demand) while relying on the large in-transit volume to limit excess new ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has shifted materially higher: Periods 1-3 avg=118.7 and subsequent weeks remain elevated (P6=114). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 provides substantial future coverage but arrivals are observed with a 2-period lag (Period 4 conclude confirmed an order placed in P2 arrived with lead_time=2). I therefore set lead time based on observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N=3 regime (Periods 1-3) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias targets upward to avoid stockouts given the sustained higher-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time confirmation to avoid overstating pipeline availability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand elevated vs historical: Periods 1-7 demands = [126,126,104,86,89,114,86], recent average \u2248 101.6 which is materially above historical sample mean \u224878. On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals are only visible next period). Observed concluded lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4), matching promised. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 7 periods so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while relying on in-transit units to limit excess holding costs.

Observed concluded lead time evidence (Period4: order on P2 arrived in P4) confirms 2-period lead time. I set L via observed average (calculate) to reflect confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the last 3 demand samples to anchor (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), balancing higher service level vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical demand (periods 1\u20139) shows sustained higher-than-historical regime (recent weeks frequently >100). One concluded arrival indicates observed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Given confirmed lead-time evidence and a sustained higher-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses actual observations; set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 9 demand samples to capture the current elevated mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 9 samples to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (higher forecast to avoid stockouts given many lost/ delayed earlier shipments) against holding cost (profit >> holding cost so higher service level justified).

Demand has shifted up vs historical (carry-over insight recorded in Period 4); recent demand samples (Periods 6\u201310 = 114,86,143,88,66) show elevated mean (~99) and notable variability. To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1), I use a short recent-average lead time to avoid overstock if shipments are faster, and base demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 periods to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: one order showed LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), one showed LT=1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2014 variable actual lead time. Demand has shifted up from historical (historical mean \u224878) to a sustained higher regime (Periods 1-3 avg=118.7 recorded earlier) and recent weekly demands remain elevated/volatile (series: 126,126,104,86,89,114,86,143). To balance service vs holding cost given high pipeline and lead-time variability, I estimate lead time from the most recent observations (recent_N N=2). For demand I use a recent-N estimate capturing the new regime (regime length \u22488), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large existing in-transit reduces immediate ordering risk of overstock if some shipments are lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. Recent weeks show sustained higher demand vs historical (carry-over noted previously). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 pipeline appears large enough to cover multiple periods but past arrivals showed variable lead times (observed 2 and 1). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability). I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L); this balances using full demand history while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff. No clear new sustained changepoint beyond the previously recorded demand regime shift.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (matches outstanding orders placed earlier but only 169 have concluded arrivals \u2192 many shipments still in transit). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4),1 (P9\u2192P10),2 (P11\u2192P13)} \u2192 avg \u22481.67. Demand regime shift at Period 4 (sustained higher demand through Period 14). To reflect true lead-time experience use calculated average lead time; to capture the sustained higher demand since Period 4 use recent_N over that regime (Periods 4\u201314, length=11) for both demand mean and volatility so base_stock and cap reflect elevated demand and recent variability. These choices trade higher service (reduce lost-sales given large in-transit) against holding cost by using recent data rather than older lower-demand history.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=380. Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) =2, P10 (order P9)=1, P13 (order P11)=2 => average observed \u22481.667. Historical/game demand shows a sustained higher regime detected at Period 4; recent history (Periods 4\u201315) supports using recent-sample estimates to capture that shift. I set L to the average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for the realized faster-than-promised shipments. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=13) to center forecasts and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (periods since Period 4), so base_stock reflects higher sustained demand while keeping holding cost exposure bounded by the capped order. The large in-transit (380) currently provides coverage for multiple review+lead periods; parameters chosen emphasize matching recent elevated demand while the OR cap will limit excessive single-period receipts.

Given mixed lead-time evidence and some late arrivals, use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history includes older historical samples and more recent variability; no strong, sustained upward shift in the most recent 5 periods (demands: 64,73,65,52,41), so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run demand while letting the backend incorporate observed lead-time average; with in-transit=380 and zero on-hand this avoids unnecessary additional ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the early high regime (Periods 1-3 avg\u2248118.7) into much lower values (Periods 14-18 = 73,65,52,41,37). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (large pipeline; some prior shipments showed variable lead times: observed lead_times = 2,1,2). Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (reflects mixed 1\u20132 period realizations and captures any persistent shift). Use mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand observations) to adapt forecast and volatility to the clear recent downward regime \u2014 this avoids overstocking given the large in-transit and recent lower demand. This combination balances service (uses observed lead time) against holding cost by shrinking forecast to recent demand while relying on existing pipeline to cover prior higher demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P10), 2 (P13) \u2014 recent average ~1.67, so I use a recent-average lead time to reflect variability and shorter 1\u20132 period arrivals. Demand has fallen from the early high regime (Periods 1\u20133 avg \u2248118.7) into a much lower recent level (Periods 15\u201319 demands = 65,52,41,37,51; recent mean \u224849). To keep orders aligned with the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I set L to the recent average (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std based on the most recent 5 demand observations. This also mitigates risk from earlier lost/delayed shipments because the recent lead-time averaging reflects the actual concluded arrivals sequence rather than the promised L=2 alone.

On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} (avg\u22481.67).

Concluded lead-times observed: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P9\u2192P10), 2 (P11\u2192P13) => average ~1.67; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand history shows a previously recorded sustained higher-demand regime (Period 4). Recent demand has been elevated in the last 3\u20135 periods (Periods 19-23: 51,17,96,132,142) so I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current mix while avoiding overreaction to single spikes. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases forecast responsiveness; choosing calculated L lets the OR engine size order lead-time coverage appropriately. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and large pipeline uncertainty) versus holding cost (profit per unit $19 vs holding $1 favors service but we remain cautious by using recent data rather than full-history extremes).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been well above historical Jan baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=415 (large pipeline but many prior orders showed variable/late arrivals). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2} \u2192 average \u22481.67 so use calculated lead time to reflect observed variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the new higher-demand regime evident since Period 4 and to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most relevant recent samples rather than old winter data. This increases target base stock to avoid stockouts given pipeline uncertainty while sigma_hat recent estimate captures current volatility for safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=415. Recent concluded arrivals give observed lead_times = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2} \u2192 average \u22481.67, consistent with promised 2 but showing occasional 1. Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 4; to capture recent demand levels use a 20-period recent window (capped at 20) for demand mean and volatility. Setting L by 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=20) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability. This balances service (higher base stock from elevated recent mean) against holding cost by relying on recent volatility for safety stock instead of inflating across-all-time estimates.

Recent demand has been elevated since early periods (sustained higher regime), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus forecast/volatility on the latest 20 weeks (reduces pull from older low-demand history). This raises the base-stock to protect service during sustained high demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability; using the backend cap still limits overshoot given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been elevated since Period 4 (carry-over insight noted); to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for demand estimates (captures most recent data since the changepoint, capped at 20). Sigma uses recent_N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the confirmed higher regime while using observed lead-time average to adapt to actual arrivals and avoid understocking given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (large pipeline). Historical concl. show observed lead times {2,1,2} \u2014 use recent_N=3 to reflect current average lead time (~1.67) rather than promised 2. Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 21 (sustained high weekly demand); use recent_N over the last 8 weeks (Periods 21\u201328) to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to service the new regime while capping order size versus pipeline. Choices: L by recent observed lead times (N=3) to capture slightly <2 lead; mu_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect elevated recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent variability. This leverages the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering while ensuring service for the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=486. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime detected in Period 4 (avg rising from ~78 to ~118.7) and recent weeks remain high (multiple weeks >130). Lead-time observations have been mixed (1\u20132 periods) but promised LT=2 remains plausible. To keep service during this sustained higher-demand regime, I use the promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecasts from the most recent regime data: use recent_N=20 samples to capture the elevated mean/volatility while smoothing older low-demand periods. This balances higher safety stock for service against holding cost given profit=$19 vs holding=$1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent realized demands (Periods 21-30) are consistently much higher than the early historical baseline, matching the previously recorded regime shift at Period 4. Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2\u2192arrived P4) =2, P10 (order P9\u2192P10)=1, P13 (order P11\u2192P13)=2 \u2192 recent lead times = [2,1,2], average \u22481.67. I choose L='recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the most recent observed lead-time average and allow the OR engine to account for slightly under-2 realized lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime evident across many recent periods (Periods 21\u201330 show elevated weekly demand), so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 10 demand samples to prioritize the current regime and limit dilution from older low-demand periods. These settings raise the base-stock to serve the higher demand while keeping sigma estimate aligned to recent variability; using recent lead-time average reduces risk of over-ordering if actual lead time is below the promised 2 periods.

Recent demand has been substantially above historical (sustained high regime since Period 4) so I base demand estimates on recent history: use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained uplift while the backend caps orders; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering risk.

Recent demand is substantially higher than early historical (many weeks >100, recent spikes to 180+ and 206); to capture current regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (focus on last 20 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and higher variance. This choice keeps target base-stock high enough to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering; using backend lead-time calc plus recent demand stats balances service level (capture current high demand) versus holding cost given sizeable pipeline.

Demand has clearly shifted up in recent months (many weekly demands >> historical ~78), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new higher regime. I select N=10 (recent regime from ~Period24\u2192Period33, length=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflect the sustained elevated demand while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. These parameters prioritize service (capture higher mean) while sigma_hat recent_N constrains safety stock to observed recent variability. No evidence of new lead-time regime beyond mixed 1\u20132 observations, so let backend calculate average lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=539 (large pipeline but past periods show delayed/variable arrivals). Observed concluded lead times: P4 (2), P10 (1), P13 (2), P35 (3) \u2014 recent 3 avg = 2 \u2192 use recent_N N=3 for L. Historical carry-over flagged a sustained demand regime shift from Period 4 onward (higher demand); to capture current elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (cap recent window to 20 samples from the post-shift regime). These choices aim to size base stock to the higher-demand regime while reflecting recent lead-time behavior and pipeline; large in-transit suggests potential overhang, so using recent demand stats avoids overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (many weeks >100, peaks to 206). On-hand=0, in-transit=520 (large pipeline, some prior shipments delayed). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P9->P10), 2 (P11->P13), 3 (P32->P35), 1 (P35->P36) \u2192 average \u22481.8. To capture actual lead-time behavior I set L=calculate so backend uses observed-average. For demand I focus on the most recent high-demand regime (sustained since ~Period 24); I choose recent_N with N=13 (Periods 24\u201336) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility is elevated so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to reflect current variability. These settings prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory given the large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=535 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed W = 2,1,2,1,3,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.67) so use calculated average lead time. Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (many large demands in recent months); to capture current mean and volatility I use recent_N on demand (N=12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand regime. Profit/holding implies a high service target (q\u22480.95) so choosing recent demand statistics raises base-stock and safety stock appropriately while the OR backend cap will limit extreme orders. This balances meeting high current demand against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand is clearly elevated versus early historical samples (many weekly demands >100, spikes to 180\u2013206), and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=529. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,3,1,1} (avg \u22481.57) so I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and reduce bias from low early-season samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) so the OR engine computes demand over (1+L) periods from the most recent 10 demand observations. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given a large pipeline: using recent demand focuses orders on current elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate order needs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-11-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times (most recent): 1,1,3,1,2,... showing variability; I use a recent average to reflect current behavior. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4; to capture recent demand pattern I use a 20-sample recent estimate (capped) for mean and volatility. Choices: L=recent_N (N=5) to estimate average of the last 5 observed lead times (captures recent variability, yields ~1.6); mu_hat=recent_N (N=20) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demands (captures new higher regime); sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance higher service level needed under the elevated demand regime while keeping sigma and cap calculation tied to recent variability to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 units. Historical concluded lead-times vary (1\u20133); recent pattern mixed but average historically ~1.57. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (user carry-over): sustained lift vs older baseline. Pipeline (529) is large relative to recent weekly demand, so avoid inflating orders. I set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average (captures variable 1\u20133 behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 weeks (captures the post-regime higher mean while smoothing short spikes). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance samples. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while using an empirically averaged lead time to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 large pipeline present so avoid aggressive up-weighting. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average observed lead time is best estimate. Demand history is volatile; use backend default demand estimate to let OR engine blend long-run mean with selected L. Choices: L set to calculated average of observed lead times to capture actual variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given existing large pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Demand recent weeks show high and volatile sales (e.g. Period 42 demand=204) and earlier sustained higher-demand regime was recorded in carry-over. Current on-hand=0 but large in-transit=529 units (pipeline likely already covers many periods). Observed concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133), with no clear persistent shift recently and no fresh conclude showing lost shipments. To avoid overfitting to volatile recent arrivals while the pipeline is large, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the long-run sample statistics and caps orders given the big in-transit stock. This balances service (capturing higher long-run mean) against holding cost risk from the 529 units already in transit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have historically varied (observed lead times 1\u20133). Recent concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1,3,1,1 \u2192 use averaged estimate. Demand shows sustained elevated regime vs older historical baseline; to capture recent higher and variable weekly demand, use a recent-window demand estimate (larger window to smooth spikes). Methods chosen: L=calculate (avg observed lead time) to reflect true variability; mu_hat=recent_N (N=20) to weight recent higher-demand regime while smoothing volatility; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to capture recent demand variability. These settings instruct the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the elevated recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding excessive orders given large in-transit pipeline.

For demand I use a recent_N window to reflect the post-Period-4 higher-demand regime; N chosen at 20 (cap for recent regime). Similarly use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to the new higher-demand regime while the backend will cap orders to avoid excessive single-period receipts given the large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,3,1,1] (avg\u22481.57) \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed data. Demand regime shift at Period 4 raised mean persistently; use recent_N (N=20, capped) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime (last 20 samples) so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while limiting influence of older low-demand data.
