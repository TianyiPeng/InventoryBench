However the missed arrival for P1 is only a single missed conclude \u2014 not 3+ periods of sustained evidence of loss/delay, so do not yet treat shipments as permanently lost. Action logic: Do not place additional order now (order=0) because substantial in-transit inventory (380) already exists that should cover multiple periods if it arrives; placing more now would increase holding cost if the in-transit arrives and is not needed, and we lack confirmed evidence of sustained lead-time increase or loss to justify safety-stock replenishment.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 is the week of Christmas which can spike apparel demand, but any order placed now (promised LT=2, observed variable LT\u22483) would likely arrive after the immediate holiday peak. Lead time & pipeline: historical concludes show variable lead time skewed to 3 periods; treat LT=3. On-hand=0, In-transit=415 units \u2014 large pipeline likely to arrive over coming periods. Forecast & decision: recent demand has been volatile with multiple regime shifts; no new sustained increase confirmed in the last 3\u20134 periods. Given large in-transit stock and significant holding cost ($1/unit/period), placing additional order risks unnecessary holding cost and potential overstock. Therefore place no order this period.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end). Jeans can see modest holiday demand but recent December history (Periods 42\u201346) is mixed with one Black Friday spike (204) and otherwise low weeks (46,43,74,47). Demand regime: recent weeks do not convincingly show a new sustained shift vs. previously recorded regimes; carry-over insight already treats lead time conservatively as 3. Lead time & pipeline: prior evidence shows variable lead time; carry-over directs treating LT=3. Current pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=415 units. Planning: with conservative LT=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 weeks of demand. Using a conservative weekly forecast ~100 units (midpoint between recent low weeks and historical higher regime) implies ~400 units coverage target. In-transit (415) already meets/exceeds that target. Ordering now would risk unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) without evidence of a sustained demand surge. Action: place no order this period to avoid extra holding cost while in-transit stock is sufficient to cover near-term demand under conservative LT assumptions.",
