Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860024 (women's trainer socks). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04): [28,38,34,44,41], mean=37.0, std\u22485.8. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unobserved. Promised lead time=2. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This balances service level (reasonable safety stock from observed variability) against low holding cost ($1/unit) without overreacting to limited data or unconfirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~37 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=48 (Period 1 order of 48 concluded as arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude, but this is expected given promised lead time=2 and cannot be used to infer actual lead time yet). I use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample set. This keeps policy aligned with historical weekly demand while avoiding premature lead-time changes based on a single non-arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-2) is elevated vs. historical Jan samples (43 and 66 vs. historical mean ~37). On-hand=0, in-transit=97 \u2014 pipeline appears substantial but recent high demand suggests upward drift. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 still show arrived=0) so do NOT assume lost shipments; keep promised lead time. Use L=default to retain promised lead time (2). Use mu_hat=EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent higher demands more while retaining historical signal; this adjusts the (1+L)-period demand forecast toward recent increases. Keep sigma_hat=default to avoid overfitting variance with limited new data. These choices balance service (responding to uplift) vs holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (orders from P1-P3), and no arrivals have concluded despite promised L=2 => shipments are overdue. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = [43,66,57], recent mean = 55 units/week vs historical Jan mean \u2248 37, indicating a demand upswing. Set L explicit=3 because orders placed in P1 should have arrived by P3 under promised L=2 but did not (evidence of longer lead time or delays). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new, higher demand regime (protect service level while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1/unit). These parameters instruct the OR backend to size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand and to use recent volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time increased: orders placed in Period 1 did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, implying actual lead time >=3 periods; Demand regime shift: recent 3-period avg=55 vs historical Jan avg\u224837 (+49%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized demand has stepped up vs historical Jan samples: last 3 concluded demands = [66,57,44] (avg \u224855.7) vs historical weekly Jan avg \u224837. On-hand=5, in-transit=197; one early-order (P1) never concluded by P3 but P2 order concluded with lead_time=2. Evidence is mixed on lead time but only one observed concluded lead time=2, so use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent upward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3). This raises target base stock to cover the higher short-run demand while recent_N sigma increases safety stock to buffer potential variability and missing shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated vs Jan historical: last 3 observed demands = 57, 44, 43 (avg 48) vs Jan weekly avg \u224837. On-hand=0, in-transit=197 (pipeline sizable). Historical concluded lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Early missing arrivals suggest past lost/delayed shipments but most recent concluded evidence supports L\u22482. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while using confirmed lead-time data, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use a recent_N (N=3) forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) multiplier applies to the most recent demand regime. This increases service for higher demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same short window; large in-transit inventory reduces aggressive ordering, so this balances service-level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=197. Recent demand has stepped up: last 3 concluded demands = [44,43,73] (avg \u224853.3) versus historical Jan mean \u224837. Some shipments were delayed earlier, so I treat lead time as longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative given missed arrivals and to cover extra in-transit exposure. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat based on the most recent 3 demands across review+lead. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability (including the 73 spike). These choices increase target base-stock to raise service under longer/uncertain lead time while keeping sigma aligned to recent variability so the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows a sustained upward demand regime: last 3 concluded demands = 43,73,98 (avg \u224871.3) vs historical Jan mean \u224837 (+~92%). Shipments have been delayed previously (Period1 order missing by P3 conclude) \u2014 I treat lead time as longer than promised. To protect service for the now-higher demand and account for delayed arrivals, I set L explicit=3 (conservative estimate of actual lead time), use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma uses recent variability to set safety stock; helps balance high lost-sales cost (profit $19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=1, in-transit=303. Historical weekly Jan samples mean\u224837 but recent demand has clearly shifted higher (recent weeks demand: 73,98,72). Lead-time observations are mixed (observed concluded lead_times = 2, 1) so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current expected L. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (weights demand over the (review+lead) horizon based on the most recent 3 weeks), which increases target base-stock to prioritize service while sigma recent_N raises safety stock to reflect higher variability. This balances higher profit per unit vs low holding cost while acknowledging overdue/lost shipments in history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand is elevated vs Jan baseline (recent 3-period avg ~ 79? \u2014 see history: demands 72,69,? but carry-over noted recent 3-period avg=55 vs historical ~37). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (large pipeline, but many past orders showed delayed/lost arrivals). Given prior evidence of increased lead time (carry-over) and ongoing delayed arrivals, I set L explicit=3 to be conservative. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher recent regime. Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise base_stock to protect service level during longer/variable lead times while relying on pipeline volume to cap ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=28, in-transit=266. Historical demand samples (Jan) mean\u224837, but recent realized demand (Periods 8-10) averaged \u224873, a sustained higher regime over the last 3 periods. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} (avg\u22481.67), so I let backend compute average observed lead time to capture variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the most recent 3 demand periods to reflect the new higher-demand regime and elevated volatility; this increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts while cap limits will curb excessive ordering given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=266. Historical Jan samples show mean\u224837 but recent selling has risen sharply (sustained higher demand since Period 6). Lead-time observations are mixed (observed 1\u20132, plus earlier missed arrival), so use backend-calculated average lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent demand (most recent 6 concluded demands: P6\u2013P11) to capture the new higher-demand regime and higher volatility; this biases base-stock up to avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent high demand while still letting OR cap limit excessive ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Recent demand has shifted up: last 3-period avg demand = 98.7 vs historical Jan avg \u224837 (+~166%), and several orders experienced delayed or lost arrivals (evidence in earlier periods). To be conservative against further delays and to match the higher recent demand, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (focus on the most recent sustained surge) so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock appropriately while limiting exposure by using a short recent window.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand has been volatile but elevated vs. Jan history; on-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline, some shipments overdue/not concluded). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2] (Periods showing arrivals), so I use recent_N=3 to estimate lead time (captures latest behavior). Demand appears shifted upward recently; I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 11-13) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting higher recent demand while letting the OR backend cap orders; using recent_N for L helps the backend account for the shorter/variable observed lead times rather than blindly trusting the promised LT when shipments have been inconsistent.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods; an earlier missing arrival suggested a possible >2 delay), so I let the backend compute an empirical average from observed concludes (method: calculate). Recent demand has clearly risen vs Jan baseline; I therefore use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses the last 3 concluded demand samples: Periods 12\u201314 = 102,61,74). This keeps target stock (1+L)-scaled to the recent mean and raises safety stock to recent volatility, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $19 profit per unit. The large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering pressure but using recent statistics prevents under-forecasting if elevated demand persists.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has shifted up: last 3 realized demands = [61,74,76], recent 3-avg = 70 vs historical Jan avg \u224837 (+~90%). Observed concluded lead times (from period concludes): [2,1,2,2] with the last three = [1,2,2] \u2192 recent average \u22481.67. On-hand=0, in-transit=397, so pipeline is large but lead-time variability and past missing arrivals warrant using recent data. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime and its volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability, balancing service level and holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed 1\u20132) plus a missed arrival implying actual lead time >=3 (Period 1 order not arrived by Period 3 conclude). Recent demand elevated: last 5 demands = [102, 61, 74, 76, 102] (avg\u224883) vs earlier Jan avg\u224837. To protect service given possible extended lead time and higher recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and short recent variance. This reduces stockout risk while keeping holding cost in mind (profit/holding cost implies high service target).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has risen sharply: Periods 15-17 demands = 76,102,76 (avg \u224884.7) vs historical Jan avg \u224837. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times: observed = {2,1,2,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.75. Given sustained high demand in the last 3 periods, set lead time to be inferred from observations (calculate) and use recent 3-period demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base-stock to meet the new regime while capping orders via its cap. This balances service (capture high profit $19/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by responding to confirmed higher demand rather than diluting with long-term historical low average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 15-17): recent avg = 84.7 vs historical Jan avg \u224837 (+130%), sustained for 3 periods

Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline; last 4 concluded demands (P15-P18)=76,102,76,66 -> recent avg\u224880. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime while reacting to slightly variable lead-times, I set L using recent lead-time evidence (recent_N=3) to weight most recent observed lead-times; I set mu_hat to recent_N over the last 4 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand under the elevated regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward higher service (higher mu_hat) given strong recent demand, while recent_N for L keeps lead-time estimate responsive to recent arrivals and reduces risk from assuming promised lead-time when shipments have been delayed in the past.

On-hand=0, in-transit=397 \u2014 substantial pipeline but several past shipments were delayed/lost, and past conclude messages indicate actual lead time >=3. I set L explicit=3 to capture the observed longer lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=397 units (large pipeline available but some past delays observed). Observed concluded lead-times = {2,1,2,2} (avg \u22481.75 \u22482).

For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201320) for mu_hat and sigma_hat; this focuses the base-stock on current elevated demand and limits stockouts while controlling holding cost given sizable in-transit.

Demand has clearly shifted upward since Periods 15-17 and remained elevated through Periods 15-21; I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the new regime. I choose N=7 (Periods 15-21) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand while the calculate L lets the OR backend average observed lead times.

Observed concluded lead times: P4 W=2, P8 W=1, P10 W=2, P14 W=2 \u2192 average \u22481.75. To capture the confirmed higher demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility over the last 8 concluded periods (Periods 15-22, N=8). For lead time I use 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (reflecting evidence of variation around the promised 2). These choices raise base_stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using the calculated L lets the OR engine adjust the (1+L) horizon appropriately; recent_N sigma increases safety stock to cover observed variability.

Demand has shifted up since Periods 15\u201323 (regime starting around Period 15); use a recent_N demand estimate over the recent regime (Periods 15\u201323, length=9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. These settings balance higher service needs from elevated demand while keeping holding exposure tied to the observed recent volatility and computed lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Historical observed lead times (concluded arrivals) = {2,1,2,2} \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a higher regime since Periods 15-18; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest 5 weeks (Periods 21-25 mean demand ~72). This balances service (capture elevated recent mean) against holding cost by relying on recent demand stats and letting OR cap limit order size given pipeline. Methods chosen: L=calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent 5-period stats to respond to sustained higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand history.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 \u2014 pipeline alone covers ~3\xd7recent weekly demand. Recent demand (Periods 15-26) averaged \u224874/wk, below the earlier confirmed peak but well above historical Jan mean (~37). Recent concluded lead-time observations are mixed but mostly 2; no new sustained lead-time shift since prior insights. I choose L=default to keep the promised 2-period lead time (backend uses promised L) while adapting demand estimates to recent demand: mu_hat recent_N (N=12) to reflect the last 12 weeks' mean demand across the review+lead window, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=12) to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to current summer demand while relying on the promised lead time and the large existing pipeline to avoid stockouts from transient delays.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical Jan samples mean\u224837 but demand has shifted higher since mid-May (sustained from Periods 15-17 onward). Observed concluded lead-times = {P4:2 (ordered P2), P8:1 (ordered P7), P10:2 (ordered P8), P14:2 (ordered P12)} \u2192 mostly 1\u20132 periods. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand regime since Period 15 appears sustained; use recent_N over that regime so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean/volatility (N chosen to cover Periods 15\u201327). These parameters aim to raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit (397) will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude, reducing new orders if pipeline suffices.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical conclues show some late arrivals and multiple missing arrivals earlier; observed lead times vary (1\u20132) with occasional long delays. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 15 (sustained elevated weekly demand). To reflect observed lead-time variability use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand, use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 14 demand samples since the changepoint around Period 15). Volatility will also be estimated from the same recent window so the OR backend sets a base-stock that balances higher service needs against holding cost.

======================================================================

Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concluded lead times (observed): 2,1,2,2 => average \u22481.75; multiple past periods show arrivals at 2 but one at 1, so use calculated average rather than default. Demand has sustained elevated regime since Period 15 (many weeks of higher weekly demand vs Jan historical); use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current higher mean and volatility. I set L using 'calculate' (average observed lead time) so the backend accounts for actual lead-time behavior. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (regime from Period 15 through current provides ~15 samples) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the sustained higher demand and current variability, helping the OR backend raise base-stock and safety stock to improve service without grossly overstocking given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 units. Recent demand (Periods 26-30) = [51,64,53,69,56], recent 5-avg \u224858.6/wk which remains well above historical Jan mean (~37) but lower than the earlier peak (Periods 15-17). Lead-time observations are mixed (1\u20132 observed); no sustained confirmed shift beyond the promised lead time. I therefore keep L at the promised default to let the OR engine assume promised lead time, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent elevated demand while smoothing short-term noise. The in-transit stock (397) currently provides buffer across multiple weeks; recent_N methods will focus replenishment sizing to recent demand to avoid excess holding cost given a high pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16. Recent observed demand (Periods 27-31 = 64,53,69,56,62) centers ~61 units/week, lower than the earlier high-regime (Periods15-17 avg~85) but clearly above the original Jan historical mean (~37). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline) and promised lead_time=2 but historical concluded messages showed at least one episode of longer lead time; some arrivals have been 1\u20132 periods. To be conservative about delayed arrivals I set L explicit=3 to ensure pipeline covers extra delay. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the most recent stable regime (weeks ending 8/12\u20139/9). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for current demand while guarding against late arrivals by extending lead time estimate.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent demand (Periods 15-32) averages ~69 units/week (18 samples) after a sustained higher-demand regime beginning ~Period 15. Pipeline shows 397 units in-transit and on-hand=0; some prior shipments were delayed but several concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,2} (avg ~1.75). To capture the empirically observed lead-time behaviour while letting the OR backend compute its own average, set L to calculate. For demand, use recent_N over the last 18 periods (the detected sustained higher-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7the recent mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=18 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand (reducing stockouts) while allowing the capped ordering rule to limit excessive inventory given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concludes show persistent delayed arrivals and previous evidence that actual lead time increased (Period 4 showed orders not arriving by promised time \u2192 actual LT\u22653). Recent demand remains well above original Jan baseline (last 5 periods demands = 56,62,53,90,69; recent mean\u224866 vs Jan mean\u224837). To protect service while acknowledging sustained longer LT and higher recent demand, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (reflects confirmed longer LT). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to scale the (1+L) forecast to current elevated demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (supports correct safety-stock sizing). This balances higher service requirement (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost by using recent demand and explicit longer lead time so OR backend computes an appropriately larger base stock and cap.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but many past periods showed delayed/zero arrivals; historical concluded arrivals give observed lead times of {2,1,2,2} so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 62,53,90,69,53) is higher than early Jan historical; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the current regime. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base stock tuned to the recent (higher and more variable) demand while the calculated lead time accounts for realized delivery performance, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-21: On-hand=0, In-transit=397. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with some earlier delays; large pipeline present so use empirically observed avg lead time. Demand peaked around Periods 15\u201318 then cooled; recent weeks (last 12) better reflect current demand level and volatility than full-history Jan samples. Set L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the recent post-peak demand regime and current variability while accounting for the (1+L) review+lead period scaling the backend will apply. This balances high service (profit-driven q\u22480.95) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline). Historical Jan mean \u224837 but demand has been higher since mid-year (carry-over noted). Recent 5 weeks (Periods 33-37) demand = [90,69,53,52,50], recent avg \u224862.8, indicating sustained elevated demand vs historical baseline. No new sustained evidence that actual lead time differs from promised 2 (recent concluded arrivals show 1\u20132). Therefore: keep L as default (promised lead time=2) so OR uses promised lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current higher demand regime over the last 5 weeks; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (covers elevated recent demand) while avoiding overreaction because substantial pipeline (397) already exists.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concludes show variable and at-times extended lead times (notably orders placed in P1 missing by P3 conclude), and several shipments delayed\u2014so I treat lead time as longer than promised to avoid stockouts. Recent demand (Periods 33-38 = 90,69,53,52,50,51) averages \u224861.5; I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) to capture the current regime. sigma estimated from the same recent window (N=6) to reflect current volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand and protect against overdue/lost shipments while balancing holding cost via recent-demand-based variance.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline but recent conclude history shows no new arrivals \u2192 possible delays/lost shipments but no concluded lead-time change since earlier evidence). Observed concluded lead times: {P4: ordered P2 \u2192 2, P8: ordered P7 \u21921, P10: ordered P8 \u21922, P14: ordered P12 \u21922} \u2192 average observed \u22481.75. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior rather than blindly using promised 2). Recent weekly demand has moved around (Periods 33\u201339 = 90,69,53,52,50,51,22) \u2014 no sustained high spike; I therefore anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the recent 7 samples to reflect the latest demand regime and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat tightens the forecast to current demand, limiting overstock risk given holding cost is low ($1) but profit is relatively high ($19). This balances service level and holding cost while acknowledging uncertain arrivals in pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (many periods of no conclude arrivals \u2014 risk of overdue shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2} \u2192 average ~1.75; use backend 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time history. Recent demand has shifted since mid-year and recent weeks (Periods 29-40) are lower than mid-year peaks; use recent_N to focus forecast on the latest regime. Chosen methods: L='calculate' (avg observed lead times), mu_hat='recent_N' N=12 to capture recent demand pattern over last 12 periods, sigma_hat='recent_N' N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters reduce ordering risk given possible delayed/lost shipments and prioritize matching orders to current lower demand to limit holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 => large pipeline but many past orders have not concluded (overdue). Historical conclude messages (Period 4) showed lead time >=3 and many later orders never concluded, so I treat actual lead time as longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 38-42 = 51,22,23,25,45) averages ~33.2, lower than earlier mid-year spikes; no new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded shifts. I set L explicit=3 to account for observed multi-period delays/overdue shipments. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent low-demand weeks (so the OR backend won\u2019t overstock given delayed arrivals). This balances service level (accounting for longer lead times) against holding cost given high pipeline and current low recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Recent weekly demand (Periods 39-43) = [22,23,25,45,28], recent mean \u224828.6. Historical earlier in-year showed higher regimes, but recent five weeks show lower Dec demand. Prior evidence (carry-over) showed lead time has increased (orders once late \u2192 actual \u22653). To be conservative vs. missing/delayed shipments, set L explicit=3. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N=5 to capture current low-December level: mu_hat uses last 5 samples so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with observed low December demand while the longer L guards against underestimated lead time and protects service given large in-transit volume.

Historical observed lead times average \u22482 (mix of 1\u20132 periods); no sustained new lead-time regime since earlier transient delay. Recent realized demand (Periods 40\u201344) is lower than summer spike; to avoid overstocking while protecting service during the 2-period promised lead time, keep L as default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current Dec demand regime (captures the last 5 weeks: 23,25,45,28,33) so the base-stock and cap calculations weight current low-season demand and reduce excess orders despite large in-transit volume.

Demand history includes Jan baseline samples (mean\u224837) and mixed later weeks including occasional spikes; no NEW sustained demand regime change in the last 3+ concluded periods that isn't already recorded. To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit, I keep demand estimates at default (use full-sample mean and std) so the OR engine's capped policy will naturally limit additional orders.
