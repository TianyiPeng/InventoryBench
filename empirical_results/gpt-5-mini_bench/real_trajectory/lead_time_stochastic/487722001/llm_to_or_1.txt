Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [42,56,47,42,42], mean=45.8, no in-transit or on-hand inventory, and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Promised lead time (2) is used as default. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the base-stock and cap formulas with full historical sample set. This is conservative given no evidence of regime change or delayed/lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~45.8 units; Period 1 demand was a one-time spike to 63. On-hand=0, in-transit=56 (order from P1 showed arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps: L=default keeps promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=default uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to reflect normal demand across review+lead; sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples for uncertainty. This balances service (covers typical lead+review demand) while avoiding overreaction to a single high-demand week and limiting holding costs given low holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (orders from P1/P2). Concluded history shows no arrivals yet but per timing this is expected (promised L=2 means arrivals will appear in conclude message next period). No sustained demand or lead-time regime change (historical sample mean \u224845.8). I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand volatility/mean scaling so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and default sigma, balancing service level given usual weekly demand and low holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=186; historical weekly demand mean=45.8 (samples: 42,56,47,42,42). Orders placed earlier have not concluded by promised lead time (no arrivals visible yet), suggesting actual lead time may be longer than promised. To protect service and account for possible delayed shipments, I explicitly increase lead time to 3 periods. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend scales demand across the (1+L) review+lead window using all samples, balancing fill-rate (higher L raises required stock) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=30, in-transit=174. Concluded history shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), matching promised lead time. No clear demand regime shift: historical weekly samples (42,56,47,42,42) plus recent periods (63,68,28,34) show variability but no sustained change of 3+ periods. Use default lead time to trust supplier promise, and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (using observed lead time) versus holding costs given available pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand samples (42,56,47,42,42) show stable weekly demand (mean\u224845.8). On-hand=5, in-transit=174; observed lead time confirmed as 2 periods in prior conclude. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps with full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (large in-transit + stable demand) against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical baseline samples (weekly): [42,56,47,42,42]; recent realized weekly demands in game history show variability (63,68,28,34,25,30) with no sustained regime shift. One confirmed lead-time observation exists (Period 2 order arrived Period 4 => LT=2). I choose the promised/default lead time so backend uses L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages long-run sample stats while the pipeline (174 in-transit) covers near-term demand and avoids overreacting to short-term noise or possible lost orders.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Recent demand dropped from high early-period peaks (63,68) to a lower stable regime from Period 3 onward (periods 3-7 demands = 28,34,25,30,28; mean=29.0). Use promised lead time (2) and base forecasts from the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures periods 3-7 regime length=5) so the OR engine targets stocking for the reduced demand and avoids excess holding given Holding=$1 vs Profit=$19.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical demand samples (early 2019) plus recent periods show steady weekly demand ~25\u201368 with no sustained regime shift. A confirmed arrival (Period 4 conclude) showed actual lead time = 2 (order from P2 arrived P4). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect that confirmed value. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, giving a conservative aggregate forecast and variability estimate that balances service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1). This also lets the backend cap orders using its cap formula while accounting for the confirmed lead time and current pipeline (174 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has dropped from early high (Periods1-4: 63,68,28,34) to a stable lower regime in the last 5 periods (P5-P9 demands = 25,30,28,25,19; mean=25.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=174 (pipeline large). Lead-time evidence: concluded arrivals show lead_time=2 (Period2 order arrived Period4). I set L=calculate to lock inferred lead time=2 from observed arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N N=5 to capture the new lower regime; mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands so the backend sizes orders for the 3-period demand window. Volatility similarly uses recent_N N=5 so the safety stock reflects recent variability. This keeps service high for the current lower demand while avoiding excess holding given already-large in-transit pipeline and $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has declined from earlier Jan means (~45) to a sustained lower regime (~28\u219216 over Periods 3\u201310). On-hand=0, in-transit=174 (no new concluded arrivals beyond prior). Lead time previously confirmed as 2. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 3\u201310) so the backend sizes base stock to current demand levels and avoids excess holding given low holding cost. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to match recent volatility and prevent overstating uncertainty while accounting for variability in the last 8 periods.

For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 4\u201312) to capture the more recent lower-demand regime (mean \u224827.6 per period) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This keeps orders aligned with current demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost is low but nonzero.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 periods (Period 4: order on P2 arrived P4). Pipeline (174) already covers multiple periods of expected demand, so use promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap. Choosing default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat uses all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and balances service level vs holding cost given a large in-transit position and stable historical data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=174 units. Historical demand samples show steady weekly demand around mid-20s with occasional spikes (e.g. 47). Carry-over already confirmed actual lead time=2 at Period 5. In-transit volume (174) sufficiently covers (1+L) periods of expected demand, so use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean and std over (1+L) horizon. This keeps parameters grounded in full historical data and lets the OR engine cap orders appropriately given its promised lead time and demand uncertainty.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical concluded lead times confirm LT=2 (carry-over). Recent observed demand (most relevant) shows higher weekly mean than Jan baseline. Use promised/default LT to keep alignment with confirmed evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (weeks P11-P15 demands: 24,47,28,25,42) to capture the current regime; this yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast focused on recent behavior and avoids diluting with much older Jan samples. For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine an updated short-term mean and variability while relying on the confirmed lead time, balancing service level (using recent demand) vs holding cost (not inflating mu with long-ago data).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical concluded arrivals show one confirmed lead time: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u21d2 observed lead_time=2 (matches promised 2). Recent demand has been higher than the early Jan samples; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12-16) = [47,28,25,42,38], mean=36. To keep service across the review+lead window while limiting holding cost, I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime. L: use default promised lead time (2). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 so backend computes (1+L)*mean(last 5). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:

No recent sustained changepoint in demand or lead time; recent periods show varied weekly demand but not a persistent shift. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging historical samples provided). This keeps the policy conservative given large in-transit volume and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Jun 2019) show stable weekly demand with no sustained regime shift; prior conclude messages confirm at least one observed lead time=2. To be conservative and leverage full sample stability while respecting observed lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period lead time), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use full history) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Pipeline appears healthy (174 units) so use promised/confirmed lead time and population-level demand estimates. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given no new sustained demand or lead-time changes.

No sustained demand regime shift evident in recent weeks (weekly demands mostly 16\u201347). I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps parameters grounded in the full historical sample while the in-transit pipeline (174) will be reconciled by the backend ordering cap to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Concluded history shows lead time = 2 (Period 2\u21924) and no sustained new lead-time or demand regime shifts in recent periods (many zero arrivals but no multi-period confirmed change). Use promised lead time (default) and default demand statistics computed from all samples (2019-01 weekly samples provided) so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters grounded in historical data while the large in-transit pipeline cushions service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 5 insight).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has spiked sharply starting Period 22 (75,87,67). On-hand=0, in-transit=174 \u2014 pipeline below (L+1)-period demand under the new regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 2) because lead-time was previously confirmed as 2 and no contrary conclude messages exist. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 22-24 average ~76.3); mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3). Volatility is set recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices push the OR backend to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new regime while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with confirmed evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg demand increased from ~31.6 (Periods 1-21) to ~76.3 (Periods 22-24), +141%.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has shifted up sharply: Periods 22-24 demands = 75,87,67 (avg ~76). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (covers multiple future periods). Promised lead time=2 and prior conclusion confirmed lead time=2 (Period 2\u21924). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 22-24) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit position reduces immediate stockout risk and limits additional ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 22 (recent demands: P22=75, P23=87, P24=67, P25=103, P26=129; recent mean=92.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=309 units. Promised lead time=2 and prior evidence confirmed L=2 (Period 4 conclude). Using L=default (promised) because concluded history supports 2 and there is no sustained evidence of longer lead times. For demand I use a recent_N forecast focused on the confirmed new regime: N=5 (Periods 22\u201326) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples (with (1+L)=3, recent mean\u224892.2 \u2192 implied mu_hat\u2248276.6). Pipeline (309) exceeds that 3-period demand (~276.6), so no immediate replenishment is required; this balances service level (covering the new higher demand) while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility in the new regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 2 (arrivals: P2->P4, P25->P27). Demand shifted up starting Period 22 (avg ~76 over P22-24 vs ~31.6 prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=263 (covers multiple periods). To capture the new high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime: N=6 (Periods 22-27) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent high-demand samples, improving service during the sustained higher demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 22: last 7 demands (P22\u2013P28) = [75,87,67,103,129,109,113], mean \u224897.57. On-hand=0, in-transit=351 units (sufficient to cover ~3.6 weeks at recent mean). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods (carry-over). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat are driven by the post-change regime; keep L at default (promised 2) consistent with confirmed evidence. This balances service (higher target stock for higher demand) while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 22 (weekly demands ~75\u2013129) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=356 units (large pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed at 2 in past concludes; use promised lead time. To reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent_N=8 (Periods 22\u201329) for demand mean and volatility so the base stock and cap reflect elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 22 (higher mean demand); observed lead times mostly 2 with one 3-period observation (not yet sustained). Current on-hand=34, in-transit=230 so pipeline is large relative to one-week demand. I set L using historical observed lead times (average of observed lead times) to let the backend adjust for the occasional 3-period realization. For demand I use recent_N (last N=9 periods since the confirmed regime change at Period 22) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher post-change demand and recent volatility; this keeps target base-stock aligned with the new regime while the large in-transit inventory limits immediate ordering risk.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=309 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={2,2,3,2} \u2192 avg\u22482.25) so I use a recent average for L to reflect this variability and avoid assuming promised=2. Demand regime increased at Period 22 and has persisted; use a recent_N forecast using the last 10 demand samples (regime length \u224810 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility. These choices make orders responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for slightly elevated/variable lead time and the large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=13, in-transit=259. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed W = 2,2,3,2,1 across recent concludes). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 22 (sustained higher demand through Periods 22-32); to capture the new regime use recent_N for demand estimates with N=11 (periods 22\u201332). Apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices balance higher target inventory for increased demand while using observed lead-time behaviour to avoid over-ordering against delayed/lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand regime (shift at Period 22) remains: weekly demand since P22 is much higher than earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (covers upcoming demand). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3,2,1} \u2192 average 2. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L by calculate (avg observed =2) and use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the 12-week high-demand regime (Periods 22\u201333). This balances service (avoid stockouts in new high regime) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:

Observed lead times (concluded messages) = {2,2,3,2,1} \u2192 average ~2. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use a recent-sample demand estimate (covering the post-changepoint window) and use calculated average lead time so the OR engine sees L=2 while mu/sigma reflect recent elevated demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and large pipeline) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (previously recorded), so use default demand/statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to let the OR engine combine full sample history with the inferred L. Use default sigma to reflect observed volatility across all samples. This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) while letting the backend cap orders and account for pipeline; choosing calculated L helps mitigate missed/delayed shipments by using empirical lead-time evidence.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline likely covers multiple weeks of elevated demand). Observed concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133), recent mean higher than promised; using recent_N (N=5) for L to weight the most recent 5 observed lead times (avg ~2.4) to better reflect current variability. Demand shifted up at Period 22 and has persisted; use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the entire new high-demand regime (Periods 22\u201337 length=16). These choices keep orders conservative given pipeline size and elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=295 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists though arrivals are delayed/unobserved until conclude messages. Demand regime shift at Period 22 (avg rose ~+141%) remains the dominant pattern; recent weeks show high volatile demand (many demands >80). I keep L as default (promised 2) because historical concluded lead times vary but earlier carry-over confirmed 2 and there is no new 3+ period sustained shift. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to prioritize the most recent high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given high recent demand and the large in-transit volume, while using recent samples limits dilution from older low-demand periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 22 (weekly demands mostly 75\u2013183) and highly variable observed lead times (1\u20133 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 units (large pipeline from recent orders). I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability rather than trusting the promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (periods 22\u201339) to base mu_hat on the confirmed high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine to target a higher base stock appropriate for the new regime while letting the backend\u2019s lead-time estimate smooth the variable delivery lags.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 (much higher weekly demand since then). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 \u2014 substantial pipeline that should cover multiple weeks of elevated demand, but past arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) so use observed lead times to inform L. I select L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 22\u201340) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same recent_N N=19 for sigma to capture volatility in the new regime. This balances service (capture higher mean and variance) while relying on large in-transit to limit immediate orders and reduce holding cost risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=71, in-transit=295 (ample pipeline). Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times but promised lead time is 2; recent concluded shipments (e.g. P39\u2192P41) support 2 as reasonable. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 22 (higher mean); use the post-changepoint data for forecasting. Set L to promised lead time to align with contract. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (covering Periods 22\u201341) so the OR engine targets the new higher-demand regime while respecting observed variability and the promised lead time. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 22 (carry-over insight). Observed lead times have clustered around 2 and earlier carry-over confirmed L=2; use promised/default lead time. To capture the post-changepoint demand level, set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent 10 demand samples (focus on the higher regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep L at the promised value while centering forecast and safety stock on the confirmed, sustained higher-demand regime, balancing service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand regime increased substantially since Period 22; latest weeks show high weekly demand (many >100). On-hand=0, in-transit=506 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals may be staggered/delayed (several past orders showed variable lead times). Use calculate for L to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history (captures observed variability vs promised=2). Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*historic mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, preserving sample-based demand estimate while accounting for inferred lead time. This balances high profit (q\u22480.95) favoring service with large pipeline already in-transit; avoids further aggressive explicit up-forecasting given substantial in-transit stock and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=506. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W: 2,2,3,2,1,3,3,1,2; avg \u22482.11) so I let backend compute the average from observed lead times. Demand shifted up at Period 22 and has remained elevated; I use recent_N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean and volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the elevated (1+L) review+lead demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability sets safety stock appropriately given holding cost vs profit tradeoff.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Inventory: on-hand=124, in-transit=295. Historical lead times vary (1\u20133) but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2; no new sustained LT change. Demand shifted up starting Period 22 (carry-over note). Recent demand remains in the higher regime (many weeks >80). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=2. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean), and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize meeting high current demand while capping excess orders via the OR backend cap, balancing service level and holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Demand shifted up at Period 22 and has remained in the higher regime; to capture the current elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples. This balances service (higher target stock after sustained jump) against holding cost given sizable pipeline already in-flight.
