Holding cost is low ($1) while profit is high ($19), so modest rounding up to provide a small safety buffer for the Valentine uplift is justified.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period start 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 likely elevated gift-season demand for lingerie. Demand analysis: recent regime is the high-demand regime confirmed earlier (Periods 36+); recent weekly demands (P41\u2013P45) = 128,183,66,83,87 (avg \u2248109). Historical peak regime avg ~147 (Periods 36\u201338). Conservatively expect elevated demand this week; assume demand \u2248140 units/week. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2 but observed LT has varied between 1\u20133; use cautious pipeline coverage for L+1=3 periods. On-hand + in-transit = 15 + 330 = 345 usable (no new evidence marking these in-transit units as lost). Coverage target = 3 * 140 = 420 units \u2192 shortfall \u224875 units. Decision: minimize lost sales over holiday while limiting excess holding cost. Order 75 units to cover expected 3-week demand gap given pipeline and lead-time variability.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 is the week after Christmas\u2014demand often softens post-holiday. Product: women\u2019s lingerie\u2014strong demand earlier in year and around promotions, but no evidence of a sustained holiday spike this week. Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand (Periods 41\u201346) = [128,183,66,83,87,44] \u2014 recent mean ~99 but volatile and clearly lower in the last two weeks (87,44). Carry-over history: multiple confirmed regime increases earlier (avg up to ~147) but current observed sales show a pullback. Lead time & pipeline: concluded arrivals show actual lead times have varied (1\u20133 periods) but historically centered near 2; no new conclusive lead-time change in the latest conclude. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=405 units (note earlier known lost 150 was already excluded in carry-over history). Pipeline of 405 across the next several weeks is ample to cover expected demand for at least the next (L+1)=3 periods even under the higher regime (3\xd7~150=450 borderline) \u2014 and given recent demand softness and high holding cost relative to profit ($1 holding vs $19 profit), placing no additional order avoids expensive excess inventory. Action: do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs; monitor arrivals in the coming concludes and adjust if actual arrivals are less than expected or demand rebounds sharply.",
