Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5 points from Jan 7\u2013Feb 4) show no sustained regime change; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time deviations. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so backend can compute base-stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. No concluded arrivals observed (Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for order placed in P1), so actual lead time is not yet confirmed; keep promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples: [59,59,54,63,78], mean=62.6, std\u22488.21. On-hand=0, in-transit=78 (one outstanding order). Use default lead time and default demand estimators to let the OR backend compute base-stock while accounting for the promised L=2 and available demand history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples (5 weeks) average ~62.6/wk; on-hand=0, in-transit=158. Orders placed in P1/P2 have not been observed concluded yet but that is not inconsistent with the promised lead time=2 (arrivals would show in future concludes). No sustained (>3 periods) signal of lead-time or demand regime change. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence to adjust forecasts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (78+80+57=215) remain in-transit and none have concluded by Period 3 conclude, indicating promised L=2 is not holding. I set L explicit=3 to account for delayed shipments (conservative one-period increase). Demand history (mean\u224862.6) used with default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this raises target base-stock to cover current+lead periods while default sigma balances safety stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods: orders placed P1-P3 (78,80,57 totaling 215) had arrived=0 by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows one arrival with lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) but earlier P1/P3 orders did not arrive on time; in-transit=206 and on-hand=28 so pipeline is large but some shipments may be delayed/lost. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (evidence: observed lead_time=2). Demand appears elevated vs. the 2019 Jan samples\u2014using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the most recent 5 weeks (includes the latest store demand spikes) so (1+L)*mean will increase target base stock to preserve service level given possible delays. I match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices balance higher service (protect sales/profit) against holding cost given sizable pipeline but uncertain arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=206. History shows one observed lead time = 2 (Period4 conclude: P2->arrived P4), but several earlier orders (P1,P3) failed to arrive on time\u2014possible intermittent lost shipments. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses confirmed arrivals rather than promised). For demand I select recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 weekly samples [72,80,73,52,55] to capture recent downward shift). Sigma uses default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices keep base-stock responsive to confirmed lead-time evidence while using the most recent demand window to balance service level vs holding costs given modest demand decline and risk of delayed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=215 (matches earlier orders). History shows P2 order (80) arrived with lead_time=2, but orders from P1 and P3 have not concluded long after promised LT=2, indicating delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative, I set lead time higher than promised to cover delayed arrivals. Demand has trended down recently (recent demands: 72,80,73,52,55,37) so I use an EWMA to emphasize recent lower demand for mu_hat and a recent_N estimate for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise LT to avoid stockouts from delayed shipments while keeping mu_hat responsive to falling demand to limit holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders from Periods 1 and 3 (78 and 57 units) remain unarrived by Period 6 conclude, suggesting lost or significantly delayed shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=222. History shows multiple overdue/missing arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P3 did not arrive; some arrivals later confirmed with lead_time=2 for P2->P4). To be conservative against further unseen delays/losses, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. Demand has softened versus the early-sample mean; I use the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 3\u20137: 73,52,55,37,51) to capture the current regime and scale by (1+L) when computing mu_hat. Use the same recent 5-sample window for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices increase coverage for delayed arrivals while avoiding overstock from older high-demand weeks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=221. Observed concluded lead times: {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1} (avg=1.67) and P1/P3 orders remain unarrived (likely lost). Demand has shifted downward vs. Jan samples; recent periods (P4-P8) show lower/volatile demand (52,55,37,51,42). To balance service vs. holding given missing/lost shipments and recent lower demand, I set L to the observed-average (calculate) so the OR backend accounts for shorter effective lead-time signal; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to emphasize the most recent regime and reduce weight of older high-Jan demand. This helps avoid overordering into a potential lost-shipment situation while keeping safety for measured variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=221. Observed concluded lead times: P4 reported P2\u2192P4 (2), P8 reported P6\u2192P8 (2) and P7\u2192P8 (1). Several early orders (P1,P3) remain unarrived \u2192 evidence of lost/delayed shipments but not changing recent lead-time mode. Demand has declined in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 37,51,42,31 plus prior 55), so I downweight older samples. Set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time mix. Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.4) to emphasize recent lower demand while scaling by (1+L). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to estimate volatility from the most recent demand regime. These parameters balance service level (capture recent lead-time evidence and recent demand fall) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has declined sharply from earlier highs (P1-P3 ~72-80) to lower levels in P6-P10 (37,51,42,31,21). Pipeline shows 206 units in-transit but history shows delayed/lost shipments earlier; no new sustained lead-time change confirmed (observed lead times mostly 2). To be conservative use promised lead time. Forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the downward regime, and estimate volatility from the same window. This reduces overstock risk given elevated in-transit inventory and $1 holding cost while keeping service for remaining demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=206, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times often >2 and some lost shipments; pipeline is unreliable. I set L explicit=3 (conservative upward revision to capture observed delays). Demand has declined recently; I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand periods: P7-P11 = 51,42,31,21,23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the most relevant regime. This balances service (longer L covers delayed arrivals) against holding cost by using a recent lower demand estimate rather than the full-history mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=206. History shows intermittently long/missing arrivals: orders from P1-P3 did not arrive by P3 conclude and some later orders arrived with L=2 while others were lost/delayed. To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments I set lead time explicit=3. Recent demand has been lower than early sample peaks; I use a recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 8-12) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This balances service (longer L) against holding cost by using a short recent demand window rather than inflating forecasts with older highs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods and missing/lost shipments for earlier orders (orders placed P1-P3 had arrived=0 by P3 conclude; P1 and P3 remain unarrived by P6 conclude), indicating intermittent lost or significantly delayed shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent realized demand has fallen from late-Feb highs (70s) to ~20-40 in Apr-May; last 6 periods (P8-P13) average demand \u224827.3/week. Multiple concluded periods show actual lead time >2 and several missing/lost shipments, so I lengthen lead time to be conservative. I use recent_N=6 for demand mean/volatility to capture the new lower regime (6 chosen as recent stable window of April\u2013early May). This yields (1+L)-scaled demand over review+lead period, improving service despite delayed arrivals while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost >. Orders already in-transit (206) are recognized by the controller; these parameters bias ordering toward covering the longer effective lead time and current lower demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=206. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2) and earlier prolonged missing shipments; average observed lead time is the best estimate now. Recent demand has declined from early peaks; use the last 8 observed demand periods to capture the recent lower regime. Set L to 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the recent demand regime while the backend applies the base-stock formula and cap. This balances service level (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given inventory risk from intermittent lost/delayed shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=206. History shows intermittent arrivals with several lost/delayed shipments and confirmed lead times >2 for some orders. I set lead time L=3 (explicit) to be conservative versus the promised 2 given repeated late/missing arrivals. Demand forecast uses recent low-demand regime (Periods 8-15 avg \u224824.375/week). With L=3, (1+L)=4, so I set mu_hat explicit=98 (4\xd724.375\u224897.5) to cover the review+lead period demand while avoiding excess holdings given holding cost >0. Sigma estimated from last 8 weeks (std\u22488.455) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma_hat explicit\u224816.9 to reflect observed variability. These choices bias towards stocking enough to meet near-term reduced demand while accounting for longer actual lead time and avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). History shows many missing/delayed arrivals and in-transit=206; actual lead times have exceeded the promised 2 and some shipments appear lost. To be conservative I set lead time explicit=3 to cover extra delay risk. Demand history shows a recent lower regime (recent realized demands: 28,19,17,14,6), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and volatility. These settings raise the pipeline coverage (1+L)\xd7recent mean while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window to balance service level vs holding cost given delayed arrivals.

Given sustained evidence of delayed/lost shipments, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to buffer against unseen transit delays. Choose L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, preserving the broad historical demand signal while the larger L increases protection for delayed arrivals and balances service vs. holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 => moderate service emphasis).

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=211. History shows multiple orders overdue and intermittent lost shipments (orders from P1-P3 not arriving by P6; many later periods with arrived=0), so actual lead time appears > promised 2. To be conservative against delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Recent demand has fallen materially since early periods; use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the low recent weekly sales. Choose N=5 (last 5 observed demands) to capture current low regime and reduce overstating demand. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of over-ordering given large in-transit volume and missing shipments while allowing the OR backend to compute a base-stock tuned to current low demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent true demand has dropped from initial 50\u201380/week to single digits in recent weeks (last observed demands: ... ,7,7). On-hand=0, in-transit=206 (large pipeline that may contain delayed/lost shipments). Observed concluded lead times: {2,2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg ~1.6, so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the recent lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and volatility) and avoid over-ordering given holding cost; recent_N also helps the capped-order cap behave sensibly given the large in-transit. This balances service level against holding cost and accounts for delayed/lost arrivals by relying on observed lead times and recent demand.

Period 21 (2019-07-01): on-hand=0, in-transit=206. History shows intermittent arrival delays and several evidently lost/very-late shipments (early orders P1-P3 never fully arrived by P6 conclude). Recent concluded arrivals are sometimes 1-2 periods but missing shipments persist. To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly longer than promised to cover delayed arrivals. Choose L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; this leverages all available demand data while the increased L raises safety stock to protect service level given observed shipment unreliability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=206. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed LT samples: 2,2,1,2,1) and several lost/very delayed shipments earlier; demand has fallen sharply and remained low since Period 13. I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture realized variability (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the last 10 demand periods (Periods 12-21) where demand has stabilized at a lower regime (mean \u224811.4) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=10. Volatility is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect current low-variance demand (sigma_hat recent_N N=10). These choices down-weight the earlier high-demand regime while accounting for realized lead-time variability and missing shipments so the OR backend will target a lower base stock but keep safety for observed LT uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand from Periods 1-11 \u224860\u2192 recent avg (P12-P21)=11.4 (\u2248 -82%), sustained for 10 periods

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 13: avg demand P12-P21 = 11.4 units (\u2248 -82% vs earlier ~60). Multiple earlier orders never concluded or arrived late, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 and intermittent lost shipments. To hedge against delayed arrivals I set lead time explicit=3. I set mu_hat to use recent_N over the 10-period recent regime (P12-P21) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent = 4*11.4 \u224845.6, matching the depressed demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to capture recent low-variance demand. These choices reduce target base stock to match the new low-demand regime while acknowledging longer actual lead time and avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods and intermittent lost shipments: orders placed P1-P3 had arrived=0 by P3 conclude and P1/P3 remain unarrived by P6 conclude; pattern persisted through Period 13. Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand P1-P11 \u224860 \u2192 avg demand P12-P21 = 11.4 (-82%), sustained for 10 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand has clearly shifted down since Period 13 (recent 11-period avg \u224811.4 vs prior \u224860). On-hand=0, in-transit=206 (some earlier orders were delayed/lost historically). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg ~1.6, so use backend 'calculate' to let it compute avg observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N=11 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (P13\u2013P23). Sigma also uses recent_N=11 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices make the OR backend size base stock to the new low-demand regime while letting it infer the empirical lead time from concluded arrivals, guarding against overstock given holding cost >0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 13 (recent avg \u224811.4 units/week). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=206 units; earlier shipments show intermittent delays/losses and variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20132), so do not increase target lead time aggressively. To avoid excess holding cost given the low-demand regime and large pipeline, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the recent low-demand regime (last 10 periods) so the OR backend reduces replenishment. This also keeps parameters responsive if further arrivals confirm lost shipments or regime shifts.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Demand has shifted down since Period 13 (recent weekly demand mostly low: recent 10 periods avg ~10-24). Many earlier orders were delayed/lost (orders from P1/P3 never concluded and several arrivals exceeded promised LT), so I conservatively increase lead time to guard pipeline. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed intermittent >2 lags and lost/delayed shipments. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 10 demand samples) so base_stock aligns to current lower demand and reduces holding cost while maintaining service with the existing large in-transit (206 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 P27: On-hand=0, in-transit=206. Historical conclues show intermittent arrivals and confirmed lead_time>2 with several lost/delayed shipments (orders P1\u2013P3 unarrived by P6). To be conservative about delayed/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly longer than promised (L=3). Demand has been low for many periods but with a large recent spike (Periods 25\u201326 = 24,94); to react to recent demand while limiting noise I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 samples. These choices bias orders toward covering the longer effective lead time and recent demand variability while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has shifted from a low regime (Periods 12\u201325) to two very large weeks (P26=94, P27=104). On-hand=0, in-transit=206 (large pipeline, some prior shipments were delayed/lost historically). Lead-time history shows intermittent delays/losses (some orders took 1\u20132 periods, others never arrived). To be conservative about service and because shipments have been arriving after >2 periods or intermittently lost, set explicit lead time longer than promised so the OR engine sizes pipeline for more coverage. For demand I use a recent-window forecast to capture the abrupt uptick (use last 5 weeks to reflect the recent spike). Volatility also estimated from the same recent window to reflect higher variance. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent surge while recognizing delayed arrivals in pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): on-hand=0, in-transit=269. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (Periods 26-28: 94,104,89) after a long low-demand run. Historical concluded lead times (observed) average ~1.6 periods with intermittent lost/delayed shipments; use calculated average to let backend infer persistent lead time. Set demand forecast using recent data to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 5 weeks). Volatility similarly estimated from the same recent window so orders reflect increased uncertainty. These choices balance service (capture recent spike) while backend cap prevents over-ordering given pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg P12-P25 \u224810.9 \u2192 avg P26-P28 \u224895.7 (+776%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand regime: sharp spike beginning Period 26 (demands 94,104,89,80 in P26-P29). Historical observed lead times from concluded arrivals: {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1, P8->P10:2, P18->P19:1} \u2192 avg \u22481.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=269 (large pipeline). I choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history rather than promised 2 (avg\u22481.6). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (P26-P29). Sigma also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices align ordering with the recent spike while backend caps orders; large in-transit reduces new order size, limiting holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand regime shifted sharply starting Period 26 (weeks 26-30 demands = 94,104,89,80,128). On-hand=0, in-transit=227 (pipeline covers multiple periods but earlier history shows intermittent lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,1,2} (avg\u22481.67) so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the new high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (periods 26-30) so the base-stock and caps reflect the sustained spike while limiting exposure to earlier low-demand data. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed spike while allowing the OR engine's capped order to limit over-ordering given in-transit inventory and potential shipment issues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg demand P12-P25 \u224810.9 \u2192 avg demand P26-P30 = 99.0 (+807%), sustained 5 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. History shows intermittent lost/delayed shipments and observed lead times >2; demand regime shifted sharply starting Period 26 (large, sustained weekly demand). To be conservative on replenishment timing I set L explicit=3 to cover observed delays. For demand I use recent_N N=6 (Periods 26-31: demands 94,104,89,80,128,129) so the backend targets the current high-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead window. For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect current variance. These choices bias orders upward to satisfy the recent high demand while acknowledging longer realized lead times and remaining pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: avg prior (P12-P25)\u224810.9 \u2192 recent avg (P26-P31)=103.0 (+\u2248845%), sustained 6 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); average of observed lead times ~1.63 \u2192 use calculated average to let backend adapt. Use recent demand sample from the high-demand regime (P26\u2013P32, 7 weeks) for mu_hat to capture the sustained spike. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (same N=7) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=341. Historical concludes show intermittent lost/delayed shipments but multiple confirmed arrivals with observed lead times {2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1} (avg\u22481.75), so I let L be the calculated average. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 26; to capture the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent 8 demand samples (Periods 26\u201333) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the sustained spike while accounting for volatility. This balances a high profit/holding tradeoff by increasing target inventory to avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: avg demand P26-P33 = 121.0 vs prior P12-P25 \u224810.9 (+\u22481010%), sustained 8 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has shifted sharply up since Period 26 (sustained high demand P26\u2013P34). On-hand=0, in-transit=433 (large pipeline). Recent observed concluded lead times include 1 and 2 periods with intermittent earlier lost shipments, but recent arrivals (P30, P32) show lead_time=2 and P31 showed 1 \u2014 use aggregate observed lead time. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend learns the recent mix. For demand I use a recent_N forecast focusing on the post-change regime (N=9 covering P26\u2013P34) so mu_hat matches the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to capture volatility in the new regime. This balances higher service level for the sustained demand spike while the backend cap will limit excessively large same-period orders given the existing in-transit inventory.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times is my best estimate to capture variability and intermittent delays. I select mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10 demand observations (Period 26\u201335) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime; this raises the backend base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of high demand while sigma from the same window captures elevated variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concludes show intermittent long lead times and some lost shipments (observed lead times 1\u20133 and several orders never arrived on-time). Demand shifted sharply up at Period 26 and has remained high for 11 periods (Periods 26\u201336 mean \u2248132 units/week). To protect service while acknowledging delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative above promised 2). For demand I use a recent_N regime reflecting the confirmed high-demand regime: N=11 (Periods 26\u201336) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 11 samples. Volatility also from the same recent_N=11 sample window so safety stock reflects recent demand variability. This balances higher service needs (large recent demand) against holding cost by using recent regime estimates and a conservative lead-time to cover delayed arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=608. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 26 (sustained high demand P26-P37); historical arrivals show intermittent extended lead times and some lost shipments (evidence: earlier orders P1-P3 never arrived; recent arrivals show LT=1,2 and occasional 3). To balance high service target (profit=4, holding=1 -> q\u22480.80) while acknowledging occasional LT>2, I set L to a recent-average estimate, and base demand forecasts on the recent high-demand regime (last 12 periods P26-P37). Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the elevated demand while the recent-L estimate guards against understating pipeline needs given observed delayed arrivals and lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Current on-hand=51, in-transit=420 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 periods with recent observations skewing slightly above promised 2 (recent avg \u22481.83). Demand shifted strongly upward starting Period 26 and recent periods remain high. To balance service vs holding cost given large pipeline and elevated recent demand, I set L to recent_N to capture the recent realized lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (8) to base forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime and avoid diluting with low-demand older data. This keeps orders responsive to the current high-demand regime while preventing excessive additional ordering because pipeline is already large.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=30, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead-times show substantial variability and some >2 (observed lead times from concluded arrivals: {1,2,3} with average \u22481.77), and demand shifted up starting Period 26 and has been elevated since. To account for observed actual lead-time variability, set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times (backend will compute average). For demand I use a recent_N window capturing the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 26+); choose N=14 (length of the recent high-demand regime available) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained elevated demand and volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 26 (weekly demand ~130-230) and substantial in-transit stock (437) with on-hand 0. Lead times have been variable (observed 1\u20133 periods and some lost shipments earlier). To capture the current faster/variable behavior I set L using recent observed lead times (short window). For demand I use a recent-window forecast (last 10 demand samples) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime. Volatility also from the same recent window so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect current demand variability while acknowledging in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows large, sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 26 (high weekly demand P26\u2013P41) and intermittent/variable lead times (observed concluded lead_times include 1,2 and occasional 3; some early orders were lost/delayed). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 (pipeline strong). To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 26\u201341) so the backend builds base-stock for the current high-demand level. For lead time I use a recent_N average of recent observed lead-times to reflect the variable/occasionally longer realizations and mitigate underestimated pipeline risk. These choices bias orders upward to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime and to allow for intermittent multi-period delays, while the backend cap limits excessive single-period receipts.

2019-12-02 (Period 43): on-hand=0, in-transit=455. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (1\u20133) with intermittent lost shipments; average observed lead-time > promised. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 26 (sustained). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (covers the sustained high-demand regime from Period 26\u201342) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean across the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility. These choices focus stock on the recent high-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering when shipments are delayed/intermittent.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (large increases sustained multiple periods) and intermittent lead-time lengthening with observed lead times of 1\u20133 periods and some lost shipments earlier. On-hand=83, in-transit=312 \u2014 pipeline is large. To let the OR engine learn actual lead time from concluded arrivals while accounting for observed variability, I set L to 'calculate' (use average observed lead times). For demand I emphasize recent high-demand regime using recent_N (N=20) so mu_hat reflects the elevated demand (covering review+lead period via backend formula). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility. This balances service level (by sizing to recent high demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline and inventory; using calculate for L lets backend adapt to observed concluded lead times rather than trusting the promised 2 periods while mu/sigma recent estimates prevent overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Use lead-time inference from concluded history (varying 1\u20133, often >2) so let backend calculate average observed lead time. For demand forecast, use recent regime (P26 onward) to capture sustained high demand; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=19 (regime length P26\u2013P44 = 19 periods). These choices align the base-stock target to the current high-demand regime while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 26 (weekly demand sharply higher vs P12\u2013P25) and multiple confirmed lead-time observations \u22653 and intermittent lost/delayed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=440. To protect against observed multi-period delays and occasional 3-period arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 26 onward (use the most recent 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) to capture current variability under the new regime. These choices raise target base-stock to satisfy (L+1) periods of elevated demand while the larger L accounts for delayed arrivals/lost-shipment risk, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

I select L="calculate" so the backend infers the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variable/occasionally 3-period leads).
