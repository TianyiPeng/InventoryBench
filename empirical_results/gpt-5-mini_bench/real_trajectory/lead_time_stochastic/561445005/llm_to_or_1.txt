Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand samples (113,141,104,173,134) show mean ~133. Use promised lead time (default L=2) and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand mean = 133 (samples: 113,141,104,173,134). On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2 and no arrival evidence contradicts it. Required coverage (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 399 units, so current pipeline is insufficient but shipment still in-transit. I use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service level using historical mean while avoiding overcommit given uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) mean=133 units/week -> expected demand per review+lead (1+L) periods. Orders placed in Periods 1-2 show arrived=0 in concludes but promised lead time=2 implies we would not yet see arrivals for Period 2 order; no concluded arrivals imply NO confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility priors so the OR backend computes base-stock from long-run sample mean and std, letting it cap orders per its policy while our pipeline (358) already covers multiple periods of expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=441, and the last three period demands (156, 207, 179) are well above the historical Jan samples mean (133). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded (arrived=0) despite promised L=2, indicating shipments are delayed or lead time has lengthened. To protect service given recent higher demand and delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly longer and use a recent-3 demand estimate so the OR backend places more stock to cover the extended review+lead horizon while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments observed: orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by their promised lead time (3 consecutive periods of non-arrival) \u2014 likely lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=484. History shows mixed arrivals: P2 order (ordered Period 2) arrived in Period 4 => observed lead_time=2; P1 and P3 orders failed to conclude on-time (missing/delayed). Given at least one confirmed observation of 2-period lead time and ambiguous/missing arrivals otherwise, set L by 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 2). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to apply the (1+L) scaling to the full historical sample mean/variance (stable historical samples: mean=133). This balances service (use observed lead time) vs holding cost conservatively while allowing the OR engine to cap orders given pipeline=484.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) averages 177.6 units vs historical sample mean 133.0 \u2014 a sustained uplift. On-hand=0, in-transit=484 (pipeline). Using observed lead-time evidence (Period2\u2192arrived Period4 => LT=2) I set L by calculate to capture observed average. For demand I choose recent_N (N=5) to reflect the clear recent regime (use last 5 realized demands 156,207,179,187,159). Volatility also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture current variance. These settings raise the backend base-stock to meet higher recent demand while capping orders via the engine cap to limit excess holding given holding cost = profit. Pipeline (484) is slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 3*177.6 \u2248 533, so the policy will order to replenish toward the higher recent demand level while accounting for lead time and variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical baseline mean 133.0 (samples 2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) increased to recent mean 177.6 (Periods 1\u21925, 2019-02-11\u21922019-03-11), +33.7% sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 (pipeline covers some upcoming demand but recent shipments previously delayed). Historical baseline mean=133 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) shifted to recent mean=177.6 (Periods 1\u21925). Lead time observation (Period2 order arrived Period4) confirms actual L\u22482. To capture the sustained higher demand, set L by calculation from observed lead-times and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so m\xfb and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the new regime (covers (1+L) review+lead demand). This balances higher service level (to avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than full-history smoothing.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 (large pipeline). History shows one observed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and sustained higher demand in recent 5 periods (mean ~177.6 vs historical 133). I set L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead times (avg=2) rather than the promised value due to earlier missing shipments. For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the confirmed +33.7% upward regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 5 demands). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity prevents over-ordering this period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead times observed = [2,2,1] (orders from P2,P6,P7), and demand has shown a sustained elevated regime vs. historical baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=484 (large pipeline present). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1.67-period empirical lead time rather than blindly trusting promised). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint elevated demand regime (most relevant recent weeks), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand remains elevated vs. 2019 baseline (recent mean ~177.6 over five recent periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2192 average ~1.67. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained +33.7% regime shift. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching supply to the new higher demand while the large in-transit volume limits additional ordering risk.

Recent demand regime upshift confirmed (recent mean ~177.6 over 5 recent periods vs historical 133). To balance service vs holding given high in-transit and sustained higher demand, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times; set demand forecast using the recent 5-period mean to capture the new higher regime; set sigma using recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Recent demand elevated vs historical baseline; recent periods show higher sustained demand (many weeks >160). To bias forecast toward recent activity while keeping some smoothing, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 demand samples (Periods 4\u201311) to capture the recent higher regime but avoid overfitting single large spikes. These parameters aim to raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data calibrates safety stock; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand elevated: recent 5-period mean \u2248177.6 vs historical 133. On-hand 0 + in-transit 546 \u2014 substantial pipeline that should cover multiple periods. Observed lead times have been mostly 2 (some 1s) and lead_time=2 was confirmed; use promised/default lead time to align with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained +33.7% demand regime shift and recent volatility while letting the OR engine compute statistics across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances higher service level needed for increased demand against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand has been elevated vs. historical baseline: last 5 realized weekly demands = [114,219,267,198,197], mean=199 (sustained high demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (pipeline large but arrival timing uncertain). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,1,2} \u2192 avg=1.6, so I let backend compute a smoothed lead-time estimate. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use a recent_N=5 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets a larger base-stock; sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level needed for elevated demand while relying on backend lead-time calculation from observed arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1 and 2 periods (sequence: 2,2,1,1,2,2) so I let L be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). Demand has clearly shifted up recently; the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14) average ~220.6, well above the historical baseline. I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the new regime and higher volatility. This balances higher service needs against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base-stock with up-to-date mean/variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical baseline (previously recorded sustained +33.7% shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=662 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple periods. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); I'll let backend compute an empirical average lead time (method=calculate). To capture the confirmed recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N, N=5) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the new regime while the OR engine uses the calculated L. This balances service (higher forecast) against holding risk given large in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=662. Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent evidence confirms typical 2-period arrivals with occasional 1; averaging observed lead times is appropriate. Demand has a sustained +33.7% increase vs baseline (recent mean 177.6 over last 5 periods) so I use a recent-5 demand forecast to capture the new regime. Choices: L set by calculate to reflect observed lead-time average; mu_hat set to recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture the confirmed higher demand; sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service under higher demand while capping orders via the OR cap to limit excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent game history and earlier carry-over show sustained higher demand (recent 5-period mean = 177.6 vs historical baseline 133.0) and confirmed lead time \u22482. On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time to keep alignment with supplier (L=default \u2192 2). For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 to capture the +33.7% sustained upward shift (mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than older baseline. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand) against holding given a large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=598. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals with some 1-periods; demand has been in a higher regime (recent avg \u2248177.6 over the recent 5 periods). To reflect confirmed variability in lead time while letting the backend compute the exact average from observed concludes, set L=calculate. For demand, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained +33.7% demand regime shift (use last 5 periods to set mu_hat). Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This balances higher service level from increased demand against holding cost given large in-transit volume and past missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observations: 2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1; avg\u22481.625) so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand has a sustained higher regime vs. the original baseline (previous carry-over noted); to capture the recent elevated demand I use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility using the last 8 demand observations (Periods 12\u201319) which reflect the current regime. These choices help the OR backend raise base-stock to meet the higher demand while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid over-ordering given some 1-period arrivals and intermittent delays.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over: recent mean ~177.6 vs historical 133) and confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=562 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers (1+L) periods of demand. I set L to promised (default=2) consistent with observed confirmations. For demand level I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher regime without over-weighting older low-demand samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand variability. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while relying on the large existing pipeline to limit additional ordering risk.

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=562. Historical concluded lead times remain centered on 2 periods (no new sustained shift), so keep L=default (promised=2). Recent demand has moderated versus the earlier spike; to reflect the most recent pattern I set mu_hat using the last 5 demand periods (Periods 17-21) to capture current regime and reduce influence of older higher values. I also set sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. This yields orders sized to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under current demand level while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=556. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1; use calculated L to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324 = 155,140,94,105,111) reflects current July regime lower than earlier spring; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the order targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and variance, aligning inventory to latest realized demand and avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=556. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods with average \u22481.67; several earlier missing arrivals were resolved and lead_time=2 was confirmed (Period 2\u21924). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. Demand has shifted recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 21\u201325 demands: 140,94,105,111,86). This keeps the (1+L) forecast responsive to the latest lower demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. These settings help the OR backend reduce excess orders given large in-transit volume and observed reduction in recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=556. Historical concludes show observed lead times = {2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2} (avg\u22481.67) and a sustained demand uplift (recent mean \u2248177.6 vs historical 133). Use L='calculate' to capture observed average lead time rather than blindly trusting promised; use mu_hat and sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to target the confirmed higher-demand regime (weights the recent elevated demand samples over older baseline). This balances higher service need (raise base-stock for uplift) while using recent volatility for safety; ample in-transit stock (556) will cover incoming demand but parameters ensure orders account for the higher demand level and observed lead-time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 which is a large pipeline that should cover several weeks of demand; recent 5-week observed demand has declined (105,111,86,70,58) compared with earlier boosted regime. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded arrivals support LT\u22482, so use default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast downweights older high-demand periods while still smoothing recent drops; keep sigma_hat at default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service (pipeline already high) against holding costs by reducing aggressive uplift from older high-demand samples while preserving uncertainty for safety stock calculation.

Promised lead time used (default) because concluded lead-time history predominantly 1\u20132 and no new sustained lead-time shift is confirmed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given the large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent summer demand has fallen well below the early-year spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=556 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2); I choose L using 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (reflecting mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-summer regime (last 5 periods demands: 86,70,58,98,63) so mu_hat targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean rather than the higher year-to-date mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices prevent overordering given a large in-transit pipeline while still accounting for actual shorter recent demand and lead-time mix.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible arrivals yet due to observation delay. Recent demand has fallen vs. spring: last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [70,58,98,63,51], mean=68. I set L="calculate" to use the average of observed lead-time concludes (observed lead times = [2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2], mean\u22481.67) so the OR backend adapts to empirical lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the clear downward regime over the last 5 periods (reduces orders vs. the earlier high-demand regime). Sigma set recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and lower recent demand while letting the backend compute the base-stock and cap using empirical lead time and recent demand stats.

Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with several confirmations of 2; several earlier periods had missing arrivals but later confirms point to typical ~2. Pipeline (556) is large relative to recent weekly demands, so avoid inflating forecasts. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set (conservative given mixed recent signals and large in-transit), preventing over-ordering while the backend caps orders by its policy.

Recent demand (Periods 29\u201333: 63,51,38,28,53) is well below the earlier high regime\u2014I forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current downshift. Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend sizes orders to current low demand while the pipeline (556 units) protects against understock given lead time uncertainty.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent observed demand has fallen substantially since the spring peak: last 20 observed weekly demands (Periods 15\u201334) average ~103.6 vs earlier recent average 177.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; using calculated average better reflects observed variation. I set L via calculate to use the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower regime (20 periods of consistent lower demand). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings let the OR backend size base_stock to the current lower demand regime while using observed lead-time behavior, avoiding excess holding given the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: mean fell from 177.6 (Periods 1\u20135 recent spike) to 103.6 (Periods 15\u201334), a -41.6% sustained drop over 20 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15 (avg \u2248103.6 over P15\u2013P34) with last observed demand very low (24 in P35). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (pipeline large). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); average observed lead time \u22481.67. To align the OR backend with the sustained lower-demand regime and observed lead-time behavior, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the pipeline coverage matches reality. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 20-period regime (N=20) to capture the sustained lower mean and lower volatility (this yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding cost given the large in-transit balance while preserving service given observed lead times.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=556. Historical concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20132 periods; no new sustained multi-period delays since earlier confirmation of L=2 in Period 5. Demand experienced a prior spike then a sustained drop (carry-over notes); recent weeks remain low. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) and to use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This leverages full historical data while the backend's base-stock formula will balance profit vs. holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline (556 units) and equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show realized lead_time=2 in multiple concludes; promised lead time remains reasonable. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15 (carry-over insight) and most recent 5 periods show very low demand (Periods 33\u201337: 53,41,24,43,25 \u2192 recent mean ~37.2). To avoid overstock given the large in-transit position, I keep L at default (promised) and set demand forecasts using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime. I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will target a much smaller base stock and reduce additional ordering pressure on the large pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, some 1); recent history shows deliveries that confirm lead_time\u22482 is common but not perfect. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 35 (recent demands: 24,43,25,32). To reflect current slower demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses empirical average. This choice keeps orders small to avoid holding cost given profit=holding, while letting the OR engine compute service-level safety stock from observed variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent observed demand has been low and stable since Period 15 (many zeros in ordering history) with last weeks: 24,43,25,32,9 \u2014 well below the early 2019 spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (large pipeline). Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (observed repeatedly). No new multi-period changepoint detected. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses the known L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history \u2014 this leverages long-run historical stats while the large in-transit position plus default policy cap will limit new ordering. This avoids over-ordering given current low demand and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

No new lead-time evidence; use promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N (last 20 demand periods) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stocking appropriate to the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering need.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): recent demand has been in a low, sustained regime since Period 15 (many consecutive low weeks). Pipeline shows 556 units in-transit and on-hand=0; earlier periods showed intermittent arrivals with observed lead times of 1\u20132 (avg ~1.67) and some missing arrivals historically. To be conservative and let the backend infer stable lead time from observed concludes, I select L=calculate (average observed lead time). Demand forecast uses the most recent low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand period since Period 15). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These settings adapt mu_hat and sigma_hat to the prolonged lower-demand environment while letting the OR engine account for lead-time uncertainty via its calculations and the large in-transit position.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand 0, in-transit 556 units. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods (observed average \u22481.67) so I use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15; to capture the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 concluded demand samples to reflect the sustained drop). These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding while the large in-transit pipeline (556) will provide coverage; using recent statistics balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been at a low regime since Period 35 (recent 9 weeks mean \u224824 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times average around 2 and were confirmed as 2 earlier; no new sustained lead-time shift observed. I set L to default (promised 2) to let backend use supplier promise while relying on observed concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 35\u201343) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same 9 periods. This keeps target base stock aligned with the current lower demand and the large pipeline reduces need for aggressive orders, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15 (sustained drop to ~103.6 then falling further through Nov\u2013Dec). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=556 units (orders pending). Observed lead times historically 1\u20132 with confirmed 2-period arrivals; no new multi-period loss pattern since early periods. To avoid overreacting to older spikes and because ample pipeline inventory exists, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over full sample set. This prevents additional ordering while the 556-unit shipment is en route and balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with no ongoing prolonged loss; use aggregated observed lead time. Demand has undergone a sustained, deep drop since Period 35 (recent 11 periods). To avoid overstock given large pipeline and low recent demand, set L by averaging observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 11-period regime for both mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service versus holding cost appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: mean fell to 22.0 units (Periods 35\u201345 average=22.0, n=11), a -78.8% drop vs prior regime mean 103.6; sustained for 11 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has stabilized in a low regime (Periods 35\u201346 average \u224822 units). On-hand=0 but large pipeline in-transit=556 units (covers many future periods). Past concluded lead times show 1\u20132 periods with confirmed 2-period arrivals; no new sustained lead-time change. To avoid over-ordering given heavy in-transit stock and the sustained low-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default) and forecast demand using the most recent low-demand regime (last 12 periods). sigma_hat uses the same recent 12-sample window to capture current low volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a low base stock, reducing extra arrivals and holding cost while maintaining service for current low demand.
