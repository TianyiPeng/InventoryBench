Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (24,44,55,64,42) give mean=45.8 and std\u224813.49. No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence to change promised lead time (2). Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std (captures three-period demand and observed volatility). This balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) and limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=71 (order placed P1 arrived=0). Single conclude with arrived=0 is insufficient to infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: let backend compute L=default (promised), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are used. This avoids overreacting to one missing arrival while providing a balanced service/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time = 2. We have on-hand=0 and in-transit=134 from prior orders (P1,P2) but no concluded arrivals yet; per rules do NOT infer actual lead time from missing arrivals. Historical demand samples (weekly Jan 2019: 24,44,55,64,42) give mean=45.8. Using default methods keeps L at the promised value and lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample, which is appropriate given no confirmed demand regime change and uncertainty about in-transit shipments. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting concluded arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=154 (sum of prior orders 71+63+20). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm actual lead time; treat L as promised. Recent demand has risen vs. historical Jan samples: last 3 observed demands = [38,91,94], recent avg=74.3 vs historical sample mean\u224846. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond quickly to this regime. L set to default (promised) because no concluded arrivals to calculate actual lead time. This raises (1+L)-period demand forecast and empirical volatility to improve service while avoiding excessive long-term holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: recent 3-period avg=74.3 vs historical sample mean\u224846 (+61%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand increased starting Period 2 (Periods 2-4 show elevated demand vs historical samples). On-hand=22, in-transit=160; promised lead time=2 was confirmed by a Period 2 order arriving in Period 4 (lead_time=2). I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). To capture the new, higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (focus on the most recent 3 high-demand weeks) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These settings raise the target base stock to satisfy increased demand while allowing the backend cap to limit excessive single-period ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has been above historical 2019-Jan mean but shows some volatility (recent demands: P2=91, P3=94, P4=41, P5=29). On-hand=0, in-transit=204 (covers multiple periods). Observed concluded lead time equals promised (2 periods) so use default L to keep alignment with supplier promise. To balance recent elevated demand while smoothing variability, set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.5) to emphasize recent sales but retain memory of historical samples; keep sigma_hat default to let OR compute volatility from full sample set. This combination biases orders upward relative to long-run mean to protect service during the recent high-demand regime while avoiding overcommitment given in-transit inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=160. Concluded lead times: order on P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), order on P5 arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2192 evidence of variable LT; use average. Recent demand regime (recorded earlier) shows elevated demand; use recent window to capture current mean/volatility. Chosen: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to base forecast on the recent high-demand regime (most relevant to cover review+lead period); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the LT calculation accounts for observed LT variability and avoids overconfidence in promised LT=2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand remains elevated versus historical Jan samples; last 3 realized demands = [29,54,89], recent 3-avg = 57.33. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period4 reported order from P2 \u2192 LT=2, Period6 reported order from P5 \u2192 LT=1; average of last 2 observed LTs = 1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 \u2014 this pipeline already covers (1+L)\xd7recent mean (\u22482.5\xd757.33\u2248143), so no urgent topping. Set L to recent_N (N=2) to reflect the two most recent observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime. These choices balance service (capture recent higher demand) while avoiding excess orders because existing in-transit stock is sufficient.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=172 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed 2 then 1); I use recent_N for L (last 2 observed lead times) to reflect shorter recent lead time while acknowledging variability. Demand has clearly shifted up recently (recent 3-period avg ~74); therefore I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Recent demand has shifted up (noted earlier): latest 3-period avg \u224876 vs historical \u224846. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6); use recent average of those to capture possible variability. Set L by recent_N (N=2) to reflect observed shorter/longer arrivals. For demand forecast use recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 3 demand samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to serve higher demand while L estimation accounts for lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand is well above historical sample mean: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 8-10) = 82,58,92 -> strong recent average ~77.3 and earlier carry-over noted regime shift (Period 2). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages): 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P6 from P5), 2 (P10 from P8), 1 (P10 from P9) -> recent lead times = [2,1,2,1], average 1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (so pipeline sizable). To be responsive to the sustained higher demand I set L to recent_N using the last 4 observed lead times (captures current variability around 1\u20132). I set mu_hat to recent_N using last 3 demand samples to capture the new higher demand regime (weights most recent weeks). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices tighten forecast to recent high-demand regime while using observed lead-time behavior so the OR backend balances service level and holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=232; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times (1 and 2) and one recent order (P11) still outstanding. Observed lead times = {2,1,2,1} => avg 1.5; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 7 (recent 5-period avg \u224893.4 vs historical sample mean \u224846). To capture the new higher demand regime and elevated volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples P7\u2013P11). These parameters increase target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent captures increased variability. This also helps cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon given some overdue/in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand P7\u2013P11=93.4 vs historical sample mean\u224846 (+103%), sustained 5 periods

Recent demand shows a sustained elevated regime (Periods 8\u201312 avg \u224890.4 vs historical ~46); use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current high-demand regime. Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while backend caps orders using its cap rule; using recent statistics prevents underordering given overdue/lost arrivals and large but uncertain pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand regime since Period 7 is higher (avg \u224893.4) and persists through Period 13. To reflect persistent higher demand, set L to the empiric average of observed lead times and use a recent-window demand estimate capturing the post-changepoint regime. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime that began at Period 7: recent 8-period demand (P7\u2013P14) averages ~93\u201395 vs historical sample mean ~46 (+~100%). On-hand=0, in-transit=214 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2} \u2192 average \u22481.67, so I let backend compute the average from observations (calculate) to reflect observed variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime length P7\u2013P14 = 8) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock toward current elevated demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering despite some late/lost arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained elevated weekly demand through Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 average \u22481.67. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures realized ~1.7 vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 7\u201315) because a sustained regime change was detected there; this focuses forecast on the new higher mean. For sigma I also use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to target stock for the current higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline reduces aggressive new orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (carry-over notes). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2} (avg\u22481.67) so I let backend compute average lead time (calculate) rather than trusting promised 2. For demand I use recent_N=6 (Periods 11\u201316 demands: 146,74,72,89,94,103) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime for the review+lead horizon. I use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This keeps orders responsive to the higher, persistent demand while the backend caps orders and balances profit vs holding cost; using recent windows also helps adapt if some in-transit shipments are lost or delayed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but skew toward 2 periods (recent sequence of concluded lead_times: 2,1,2,2,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.8). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained elevated weekly demand in recent periods). I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time evidence (N=5 gives ~1.8 periods). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current high-demand regime and its variability; this focuses the OR backend on recent elevated demand when computing base stock while keeping risk of lost/delayed shipments in mind given mixed lead-time observations. In-transit=237 is large relative to (1+L)*recent mean so the OR cap will limit orders; these parameters prioritize service under the confirmed higher-demand regime while controlling holding cost.

Recent concluded lead-time observations: [2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1] \u2192 avg\u22481.625, so use calculated average lead time rather than promised to reflect mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals. Demand recent window (Periods 13\u201318) mean \u224883.5 \u2014 higher than original historical mean, so forecast using recent_N=6 to capture the sustained higher regime while avoiding overreacting to one low week (P18=45). Use recent_N=6 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These settings help the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term elevated demand while acknowledging pipeline inventory and variable lead times; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed W = [2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1], avg \u22481.56), so I use the average observed lead time to capture this variability. I keep demand mean and volatility computed from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to leverage full historical demand given previously recorded sustained regime shifts.

Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 7 (carry-over notes) \u2014 recent weeks still show elevated demand (recent mean \u224880\u201395). To be responsive to the higher regime, I use a recent_N forecast (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the newer higher average and volatility while the OR engine will cap orders using its cap formula. This balances fill-rate needs against holding cost given profit=holding, favoring moderate safety stock without overstocking outdated low-demand history.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods' demands P17\u2013P21 = 98,45,73,87,86) mean=77.8; demand appears elevated vs early samples, so use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current regime.

I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect faster-than-promised arrivals (use backend 'calculate'). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201323) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean/volatility; N equals the regime length (17). This biases orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); using calculated average lead time lets backend learn true recent L from history.

Many in-transit units (251) already on order, so avoid inflating forecasts. Lead time observations (concluded arrivals) show mixed 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average lead time to capture that (method=calculate). Forecast demand using recent 5-period average to reflect the current lower regime (mu_hat recent_N, N=5). Use recent 5-period volatility for sigma_hat to match short-term variability and avoid over-ordering. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to recent lower demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (observed arrivals) vary between 1\u20132 periods; average of observed lead times is ~1.6 so I let the backend compute an empirical average rather than forcing promised=2. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 52,36,55) does not show a new sustained regime shift beyond previously recorded shifts, so use default demand/volatility estimation so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps ordering conservative while the large in-transit pipeline provides cover for expected (L+1) demand. Using calculate for L lets the system infer the effective lead time from observed concluded arrivals and adapt orders; default mu_hat/sigma_hat balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2 periods); average lead time is best estimated from observed concludes. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes\u2014use a recent-window demand estimate to capture current regime. Choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples P23\u2013P27 = 62,52,36,55,54) to reflect current demand (~51.8 weekly) across review+lead; choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability. These settings keep orders responsive to the current demand regime while recognizing substantial in-transit inventory so the OR engine will cap replenishment and avoid excess holding costs.

No new sustained lead-time evidence beyond previously recorded variability, and no new sustained demand regime beyond earlier carry-overs. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with contract (L=default). Use a recent demand window (N=5) for mu_hat to adapt to the latest regime while avoiding overreaction to single weeks; sigma_hat use default to leverage full-sample volatility estimate. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit inventory and balances service level vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5 implies moderate safety stock).

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods with promised=2; no new sustained lead-time change observed.

Recent demand (Periods 23\u201331 = 62,52,36,55,54,63,45,17,28) is substantially lower and more variable than earlier high-demand regime. Use promised lead time (default) because concluded arrivals show a mix of 1\u20132 period lead times and no clear sustained LT change. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (the last 9 demand samples) so the backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and safety stock to recent lower demand while accounting for recent volatility; this prevents over-ordering given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 \u2014 large pipeline already covers many periods. Recent demand has dropped sharply: Periods 30\u201332 demands = 17, 28, 6 (and P29=45), indicating a new low-demand regime over the last 4 periods. No recent concluded messages indicate consistent lead-time shift; historical observed lead times are variable but not a sustained change. To avoid overstock given high in-transit and falling demand, keep promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate (most recent 4 periods) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps ordering.

Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; average of concluded lead times = 1.6 \u2192 choose calculate to let backend use observed average. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 5 true demand samples (Periods 29\u201333) avg \u224823. To capture current regime, set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand. Volatility likewise set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lower variance. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock to cover the review+lead period using recent demand while the calculated L reflects empirically observed lead-time behavior; large in-transit (251) will be reconciled by the backend when computing orders.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.56); I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201334 = 17,28,6,19,11) is much lower than long-run samples; to capture the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the recent regime length). This keeps orders conservative despite a large pipeline and reduces holding risk given Profit=Holding cost. The chosen parameters let the OR engine compute base-stock with observed lead-time and short-term demand/volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has fallen sharply and sustained: last 5 demands (P31\u2013P35) = [28,6,19,11,12], mean \u224815.2 vs historical sample mean \u224846 (\u221267%). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 (large pipeline) so avoid fresh large orders. Lead times observed historically vary (1 or 2); average observed lead time \u22481.6. I set L=calculate to use the empirical average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new low-demand regime (regime length=5).

These choices reduce target base stock and thus new orders, preventing excess holding given the large in-transit and sustained low demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P36 demands: 17,28,6,19,11,12,6), so I base forecast on the recent regime. Promised lead time is kept (default) because concluded arrivals show a mixture of 1\u20132 period leads with no clear sustained shift. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the 7-period low-demand regime length) so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current low-demand regime and reduces holding risk given high in-transit stock (251 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P37 demands: 17,28,6,19,11,12,6,9 \u2014 sustained low for 8 periods vs historical mean \u224846). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 (large pipeline but many past promised arrivals not concluded; could indicate lost shipments). I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded lead-time history mixes 1\u20132 and missing arrivals may be lost rather than a persistent longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over recent 8 periods). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce orders to match the low recent demand and avoid excess holding given large in-transit and holding cost parity with profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has fallen and remained low since Period 30 (P30\u2013P38 avg \u224812.8 units/week vs historical \u224846), so I use a recent-demand estimate. Observed concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2); average observed lead time \u22481.6 \u2014 use the calculated average. Choices: L: calculate to capture observed mean lead time from concluded arrivals; mu_hat: recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (P30\u2013P38); sigma_hat: recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent lower volatility. This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit and the sustained demand drop. In-transit=251 may include lost/delayed shipments (many later periods show arrived=0), so relying on concluded lead-time history and recent demand is conservative.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P39 mean=12.3/week); current on-hand=0 but large in-transit=251 units which far exceeds near-term demand. Many past orders had mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but promised lead time is 2; no new evidence to change lead-time estimate. To avoid additional excess inventory, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (most recent 10 periods since changepoint at P30). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this keeps target base-stock aligned to current low demand while the in-transit pipeline should cover upcoming demand and reduce new ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=251. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P40 recent avg \u2248 low teens); use recent_N with N=11 (P30\u2013P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and safety stock to current low-demand regime while avoiding carryover of earlier high-demand averages. This also avoids overstocking despite a large in-transit position and potential lost shipments.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=251 units \u2014 pipeline likely covers many weeks of current low demand. Use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (to avoid inflating orders). Selected recent_N (N=12) to capture the full low-demand run (P30\u2013P41) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target stock and avoids excess holdings given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (week 2019-09-02) \u2014 weeks 30\u201342 show consistently low weekly sales (6\u201328), so I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. On-hand=0 but in-transit=251 (sizable pipeline) \u2014 keep promised lead time so backend treats arrivals over 2 periods; use recent_N demand estimates to reflect the sustained drop. Chosen: L=default (promised 2) to align with supplier promise and because observed lead times vary 1\u20132; mu_hat recent_N with N=13 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201342); sigma_hat recent_N with N=13 to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given low demand and large in-transit inventory.

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (sustained low weekly demand). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend infer the empirical average (captures mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=14 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime from Period 30\u201343 so the OR engine sizes review+lead demand and safety stock to the recent lower mean and lower variability, reducing excess ordering while preserving service given the in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg \u22481.6) but no sustained shift away from promised 2; I let backend compute an average from observations. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (sustained drop); to capture the current low-demand regime I use recent samples (Periods 30\u201344, 15 samples) for mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps inventory aligned to the current low-demand regime and avoids overstocking given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weekly demand is very low (last 5 demands: P41\u2013P45 = 7,23,6,2,8; recent mean \u22489.2) after a sustained low-demand regime since Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=251 units but many past promised arrivals never concluded, suggesting occasional delivery delays; to be conservative I set lead time longer than promised. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to hedge against delayed arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. These choices keep target base-stock small (matching current low demand) while allowing for extra in-transit uncertainty from delayed shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (periods 30\u201346 show markedly lower weekly demand vs. historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=251 \u2014 large pipeline exists but arrivals have been intermittent historically; use promised lead time to avoid overcorrecting for occasional delayed/lost shipments. Set L=default to keep backend's lead-time assumption at the contract value (2). For demand forecast, use recent_N to capture the low-demand regime: regime length from P30\u2013P46 = 17 periods, so use N=17 (captures the most recent sustained pattern). Apply the same recent_N (N=17) for sigma_hat to reflect current lower variability. These choices keep orders aligned to the recent low-demand reality while letting the backend cap and base-stock calculations limit order size given the large in-transit volume.
