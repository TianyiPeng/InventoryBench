Inventory & risk: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 705 which, if it arrives, will far exceed one-period demand (~55) and cause heavy holding cost (holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit). Decision logic: Given a large existing pipeline (705 units) and high holding cost equal to profit, do not place additional orders now.

Supplier pipeline (525 units) far exceeds short-run demand (L+1=3 periods \xd7 estimated demand \u2248 3\xd710). Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so carrying excess inventory is costly. Given large in-transit position and uncertainty in lead-time/possible past delays, do not place additional orders this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs.",

Demand regime: recent weeks (P42\u2013P46) show low demand (23,6,2,8,7) and summer spikes have passed. Lead time / pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=525 units; history shows supplier delays but many large shipments have historically arrived after multi-period delays; pipeline likely to deliver inventory without immediate ordering. Inventory & cost: Profit = $1/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost equals profit so carrying extra ending inventory directly reduces objective.
