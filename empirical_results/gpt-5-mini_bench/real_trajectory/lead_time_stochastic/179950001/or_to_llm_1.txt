{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=631. Recent realized demand (Periods 42\u201346) averaged ~119/week (227,87,108,104,72) but has trended down from the single 227 spike; lead time is variable (1\u20133 periods) per carry-over evidence, so some in-transit may arrive sooner or later. OR recommended 0 based on promised L=2 and historical data; given current pipeline of 631 units vs. recent demand ~100\u2013120/week, the pipeline covers ~5\u20136 weeks of expected demand even allowing for lead-time variability or partial lost shipments. Holding cost is low ($1) but still penalizes excess stock; profit margin is high ($19) so stockouts are costly, but pipeline is ample now. Decision: follow OR and order 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while waiting to observe which in-transit shipments conclude in upcoming period(s). Monitor conclude messages next period to detect lost/delayed arrivals and revise orders if pipeline reduces unexpectedly.",
