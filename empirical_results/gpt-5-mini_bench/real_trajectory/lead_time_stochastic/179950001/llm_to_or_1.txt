Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly samples show a downtrend (105,62,72,48,36; mean=64.6) but only 5 historical weeks \u2014 no sustained changepoint. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=2 with no concluded arrivals to contradict it. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=109 (ordered Period 1). Only one concluded period since ordering; no arrived confirmations for past orders so actual lead time is unobserved. Demand samples available (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) plus one recent demand=40 (Period 1), but single new point is insufficient to declare a regime shift. Use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility computations so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given uncertainty and potential in-transit arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=212 (orders 109+103) but no arrivals concluded in Periods 1 or 2 \u2014 shipments are delayed beyond the expected 2-period promise. Evidence is only 2 missed conclude periods, not yet definitive, but risk of longer lead time is material so I explicitly increase lead time to 3 to cover the extra transit delay when computing pipeline coverage. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so demand forecast uses all historical samples (mean=64.6) scaled by (1+L); this balances service (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (orders placed P1=109,P2=103,P3=107) but no arrivals observed in conclude messages \u2014 three consecutive periods of zero arrivals despite promised L=2 indicates missing/delayed shipments. I set L explicit=4 to conservatively allow more pipeline coverage when arrivals are unreliable. Historical sample mean=64.6 weekly; (1+L)=5 \u21d2 forecasted demand over review+lead \u2248 323 units, so mu_hat explicit=323.0 to cover expected demand. Volatility is elevated given sparse recent observations; set sigma_hat explicit=60.0 to provide reasonable safety stock without extreme overage. These choices increase ordered pipeline to protect service level given suspected lost/delayed shipments while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments confirmed: orders from Periods 1-3 (109,103,107 total 319) have not arrived by Period 4 \u2014 evidence of lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments; treat lead time as extended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1117.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). History shows mixed arrivals: Period 2 order confirmed with lead_time=2, but earlier orders (P1,P3) were missing longer \u2014 evidence of extended/delayed shipments. On-hand=42, in-transit=319; to be conservative against delayed arrivals I set lead time longer than promised to protect service level. I choose L explicit=3 to reflect extended/delay risk, and let mu_hat and sigma_hat use the defaults (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so demand forecast scales consistently with the chosen lead time and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (includes earlier orders that have not fully concluded). Observed concluded lead time(s): Period2 order arrived in Period4 => lead_time=2. Recent demand samples (historic weekly mean ~64.6) are similar to more recent weeks. To remain conservative given one confirmed lead-time observation and mixed arrival behavior, use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 2) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand avg (historical samples) ~64.6/wk; recent realized weekly demands have been volatile (40,87,57,61,98,50) with stockouts. On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (orders from P1-3); P2 order concluded with lead_time=2 but other orders remain missing\u2014evidence of extended or unreliable lead time. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to buffer against delayed arrivals. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default (use all samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, letting the engine size base stock with the longer lead time while keeping demand estimate anchored to historical data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows delayed/lost arrivals early (P1-P3 orders not concluded) and one confirmed lead time=2 (P2\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=337 \u2014 pipeline currently large. To be conservative given missing shipments earlier, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to allow the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover against further delays. Demand samples (105,62,72,48,36) mean=64.6; with (1+L)=4 this yields mu_hat explicit=258.4 to target coverage over review+lead. I keep sigma_hat as default so the backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase safety stock to protect service level while the large existing in-transit quantity prevents over-ordering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (orders P1-3 missing/delayed). Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P7->P8), plus prolonged absence of P1-P3 arrivals implies effective lead time >2 for those shipments. To guard against understock given delayed/lost shipments, set lead time explicitly longer. Use default demand/statistics (all samples) to avoid overfitting to sparse recent arrivals. These choices raise target pipeline cover ((1+L) factor) reducing stockouts while backend caps orders to limit excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. Historical concluded lead times: order on P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), order on P7 arrived P8 (LT=1); several earlier orders failed to arrive on-time (missing/delayed shipments confirmed). Set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed LT variability of 1 and 2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) from the inferred lead time; this is conservative and lets the OR engine compute base-stock and cap while accounting for observed lead-time variability and missing arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded lead times show mixed evidence: some orders observed with LT=1 (P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10) and one LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), but large missing arrivals (319 units in-transit from early periods) indicate extended or unreliable lead time. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use default aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) from the provided historical samples (mean=64.6) and default volatility so sigma scales with sqrt(1+L). This increases target base-stock to protect service level given probable delays while relying on historical weekly demand samples for demand magnitude.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=319 (these are the earlier missing shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2 (ordered P2), P8:1 (P7), P10:1 (P9)} and multiple orders (from P1,P3) remain unconcluded \u2192 evidence of extended/irregular lead time beyond promised 2. Demand recent history (Periods 7-11) shows lower, stable demand vs earlier spike: demands = [57,47,46,43,50], recent mean \u224848.6. I treat lead time as explicitly longer to avoid stockouts while awaiting in-transit units, and use a recent window of 5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current lower regime. These choices increase the base stock to cover extended replenishment risk while limiting holding cost by using recent demand volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=319; history shows inconsistent arrivals (observed lead_times 1 and 2, plus multiple missing/delayed shipments), so treat lead time as extended to protect service. Set L explicit to 3 to cover delayed/lost shipments. Demand recently has settled lower than early Jan samples; use recent_N (last 6 demand periods) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect current demand regime and avoid overstocking. These choices raise safety stock (longer L) while using recent demand to limit excess holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (orders from P1-3). Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P7\u2192P8 = 1, P9\u2192P10 = 1 \u2192 average observed lead time \u22481.33. Multiple early orders (P1,P3) remain unconcluded suggesting some shipments delayed/lost but concluded samples support a >1 but <2 mean. I select L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand I use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) since available historical samples (Jan weekly series) remain the best baseline and there is no sustained, recent demand regime shift; sigma_hat='default' to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (raising base stock for extended lead-time) against holding cost given modest holding penalty.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. History shows multiple delayed/lost arrivals: large orders from Periods 1-3 (total 319) remain in-transit and did not conclude on-time. Recent observed lead times vary (1 and 2) and there is evidence of extended/erratic lead time for older shipments. Demand has trended up in recent weeks (last 5 period demands: 58,77,139 and preceding 50,58) indicating a higher recent mean than early samples. To protect service given overdue/in-transit stock uncertainty, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative extension beyond promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the higher recent mean over the last 5 periods. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices increase target base stock to reduce stockouts from delayed arrivals while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=422. Historical concludes show some orders arriving with L=1\u20132 but multiple earlier shipments (Periods 1\u20133) did not arrive by Period 4, indicating extended lead-time risk or lost shipments. Demand has risen recently (last 5 concluded weekly demands: 50,58,77,139,138) \u2014 a clear upward regime. To protect service given possible extended/variable lead time while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set lead time explicitly longer and use recent demand (last 5 weeks) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current elevated demand over the review+lead period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=512. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2, 1, 1 (orders that concluded). Recent demand (Periods 13-16) shows a sustained jump (77,139,138,138). Given mixed concluded lead-time signals, use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I adopt recent_N (N=4) to capture the clear recent regime of higher demand; use matching recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand evidence and letting the OR engine compute safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg increased from 64.6 to 123 (+90%) based on Periods 1-5 mean=64.6 vs Periods 13-16 mean=123; sustained 4-period elevation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift since Period 13 (period demands: 77,139,138,138,121 \u2192 elevated mean). On-hand=72, in-transit=319 (note: some early orders remain unconcluded indicating earlier missing/delayed shipments). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (evidence: concluded lead_times observed = {2,1,1,1,2,1} => shorter than promised on average but earlier missing shipments exist). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods in the new high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the ~123 avg regime across the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture current regime volatility. These choices prioritize service during the new higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid overordering against potentially lost early shipments.

Demand regime increased starting Period 13 (Periods 13\u201318 demands = 77,139,138,138,121,126; elevated vs earlier mean). Set L using observed average lead time to reflect recent 1\u20132 period reality.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=385 \u2014 pipeline is large but prior missing/delayed shipments occurred (Periods 1-3 missing); observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132). I set L='calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures actual shorter/variable lead times vs promised=2).

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods with earlier missing shipments; to be robust I let backend compute average observed lead time and use recent demand statistics from the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201320) so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (sizable pipeline but several past shipments were delayed/lost early; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times of 1\u20132). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior rather than blindly using promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 13\u201321) to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the elevated demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering despite in-transit stock and past delays.

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed leads: 2,1,1,2,1,2) suggesting average lead time between 1 and 2; earlier missing shipments noted but recent arrivals are consistent. Demand regime elevated since Period 13 (Periods 13-16 avg=123 vs earlier 64.6). To capture the observed lead-time variability use calculated average lead time (more robust than promised). For demand, use a recent_N forecast to reflect the sustained higher regime (use last 10 weeks to smooth variability). Match sigma_hat to same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand and multi-period lead) against holding cost by relying on recent elevated demand evidence rather than all-history dilution.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132) with evidence of delayed shipments; to be conservative use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the elevated demand regime; choose N=11 (covers Periods 13\u201323 recent elevated window) so the OR backend builds base stock for the higher demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods (mix of 1 and 2 arrivals); demand rose sharply starting Period 13 and has remained elevated through Period 24. I set L via calculate (average of observed lead times) to let the backend infer the current effective lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 13\u201324) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N (N=12) for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service during a sustained higher-demand period while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead-time behavior.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=410. Historical concluded lead times (most recent 7 observed): [2,1,1,2,1,1,2] \u2192 avg\u22481.43, showing actual lead time \u22481\u20132 (no sustained >2). Demand underwent a sustained regime shift starting Period 13 ( documented in carry-over ): recent demand has been ~120s vs earlier ~65. To protect service level while avoiding excess holding cost, set L as the average of the last 7 observed lead times (recent_N N=7). Use a recent demand window that covers the post-shift regime (last 13 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using current higher-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 periods with recent arrivals showing a mix and a Period 26 arrival with lead_time=3 \u2014 evidence of extended/variable lead time. Demand recently sits around ~65\u201375 units/week (Periods 22\u201326 mean \u224866.8) after the earlier high regime; use recent data to avoid contaminating forecast with older low-demand points. Set L using recent_N to capture the currently observed variable lead time (average of last 5 observed lead times \u22481.8). Set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 demands) to reflect current elevated baseline (~67/week) multiplied by (1+L) by backend. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5 demands) to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the recent demand pattern while accounting for the extended/variable lead time and large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded lead times show variability including 1\u20133 periods and earlier missing shipments; recent evidence (Period 26: order on P23 arrived after 3 periods) supports treating lead time as extended. In-transit stock (385) already covers multiple periods but arrivals are delayed/uncertain, so I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for longer pipeline. Demand in the most recent 4 weeks (Periods 24\u201327 demands = 52,66,69,63; avg \u224862.5) appears representative of the current regime, so I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current mean and volatility over the review+lead window (1+L=4). This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent lower weekly demand while accounting for longer lead time and the sizable in-transit pipeline to avoid overstock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. History shows variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133) and prior confirmed demand regime shift (Periods 13\u201316 avg ~123 vs earlier ~64.6). Many late/variable arrivals => treat lead time as slightly above promised. I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=5) to capture the recent average lead-time >1. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N=16 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (use the last 16 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices increase forecasted pipeline needs to protect service amid extended/variable lead times while relying on the confirmed elevated-demand regime to avoid underordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=385 \u2014 large pipeline but historical arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods). Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (reflects variable but shorter-than-promised arrivals observed overall). Demand shows a recent moderate elevation vs the original 64.6 mean; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (Periods 25\u201329 = 66,69,63,84,83) to capture the current regime. These choices let the OR engine set base_stock and caps using a lead-time estimate grounded in observed arrivals and a demand forecast focused on the most recent regime, balancing service (avoid stockouts given sizable in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 13 and remains high in the last 5 weeks (Periods 27-31). Pipeline is large (in-transit=385) due to prior orders and some delayed arrivals; missing shipments earlier indicate lead-time variability. I choose L method='calculate' so the backend uses observed arrival history to estimate current average lead time (captures variability vs promised). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples = Periods 27-31) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; same N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders driven by current high demand while letting the backend incorporate empirical lead-time and cap constraints to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show variable but on average shorter-than-promised lead times recently (carry-over reports avg \u22481.625). To avoid assuming lost shipments while keeping service, set L explicit to 1.625 to reflect observed average. Demand has shifted from earlier low regimes; use recent_N (last 5 weeks: periods 28-32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher recent demand (samples: 84,83,111,100,89 \u2192 mean \u224893.4).

Therefore: L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the post-changepoint higher mean and updated volatility while covering (1+L) review+lead period.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 13 (sustained higher mean); latest weeks show large weekly demand (e.g., P33=189, P30-35 avg \u2248113). On-hand=0, in-transit=466 \u2014 pipeline likely sufficient but earlier missing shipments occurred so use observed lead-time data rather than promised value. Set L by calculating the average of all observed lead times to let backend infer effective lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use 20 as regime length capped at 20). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time behavior and limiting excess holding costs given substantial pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=466 \u2014 large pipeline from prior orders. Historical demand shows a sustained elevated regime since Period 13 (mean up ~+90% earlier documented), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the current high-demand regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded arrivals remain mixed and the backend expects promised L; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) captures the sustained higher mean/variance while avoiding overreacting to single spikes. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=466 \u2014 large pipeline pending after many earlier delayed arrivals. Historical concluded lead times (Periods with arrivals) show variability and prior analysis estimated average \u22481.625; given mixed evidence of delayed/lost shipments but overall observed arrivals, use backend-calculated average lead time to let OR reconcile promised vs observed. Demand has shifted upward since Period 13 (sustained higher demand); use recent demand history to capture current higher mean/variance. Therefore: L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=20 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime samples (caps recent window for stability). These settings balance service (larger mu_hat from recent elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Lead-time observations are noisy but multiple concluded arrivals exist; let backend compute observed lead time. I select L='calculate' so observed lead time average is used. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated regime (Period 13+ long-run; cap N at 20). Same recent_N N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the confirmed higher demand while letting lead-time be inferred from concluded arrivals to handle past delays.

Lead time history shows variability and prior analysis estimated avg \u22481.625; use calculated average lead time so backend uses observed arrivals. For demand forecast use the most recent 20 weeks to capture the post-Period-13 elevated regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). Use recent-20 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture elevated recent demand) while avoiding excess given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:

Use lead-time estimate from observed history (average of observed lead times) to account for late/lost shipments. For demand, use recent regime since Period 13: choose recent_N with N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the elevated mean over the last 20 demand observations. Apply recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while acknowledging elongated/variable lead times and large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes show variable/extended lead times and past regime shift; recent demand has moderated after late-summer peaks. I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals (captures the variable/extended lead-time evidence). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to base mu_hat on the last 8 observed weekly demands (Periods 34-41) so the forecast reflects recent downward seasonality into Nov while still smoothing short spikes. I match sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost by keeping demand forecast responsive to recent weeks rather than all-time highs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=466. History shows past missing/delayed shipments but later observed average lead time \u22481.625; promised lead time=2. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 weekly demands: P38=48, P39=41, P40=29, P41=33, P42=227) with a Black Friday spike at P42. To balance service vs. holding cost: keep lead time explicit at the promised 2 (aligns OR backend expectations), and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent spike and volatility while limiting influence of older zero-arrival periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=469. History shows variable/extended lead times and several delayed/lost shipments (Periods 1-3 missing; observed lead times vary with recent avg \u22481.625). Demand has an elevated regime since Period 13 with large recent spikes (notably Period 42 demand=227). I set L=calculate to let the backend use observed concluded lead times (captures actual variability vs promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 20 demand samples (captures the sustained higher mean and recent holiday volatility). These choices raise the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility so the OR engine increases base stock and safety stock to protect service during extended/uncertain lead times while respecting holding cost via the backend cap.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=469. Historical carry-overs show sustained demand regime shift around Period 13 (mean ~123 vs earlier ~64.6) and observed recent arrivals' lead_times = [2,1,1,2,1,1,2,3] (avg 1.625). Many earlier shipments were delayed/lost, but recent 8 arrivals give best estimate of current realized lead time. I choose L=recent_N with N=8 to capture observed average lead time. Demand is in a higher sustained regime; use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on recent samples (captures latest elevated mean and volatility). These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances high profit (service focus) against holding cost, while acknowledging extended/variable lead time and leveraging the large in-transit pipeline.

Historical lead times variable but recent sample of 8 concluded LT obs is informative. I set L to recent_N (N=8) to reflect observed variability in lead time rather than the promised default. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent elevated demand regime (last 5 weeks) so the OR backend sizes base-stock for the shorter-term surge while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Historical concludes show variable/extended lead times and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 13 with recent high Dec holiday demand (Period 42=227, Periods 44-46 ~108,104,72). I choose L=calculate so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures mixed 1-3 period observations and earlier delays). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent 8 weeks of elevated/holiday demand, while the large in-transit position limits additional ordering; these parameters balance higher service needs during the holiday spike against holding cost given existing pipeline.
