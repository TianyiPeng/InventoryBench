Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals/history of lead-time deviations. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) are available but show no recent changepoint. Promised lead time (2) is used (no evidence to adjust). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand. Profit vs holding (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) favors higher service; defaults let the OR engine compute the appropriate safety stock without overreacting to limited data or potential lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=114 (ordered P1) and Period1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet; cannot confirm actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (79,80,88,115,80) imply baseline weekly mean ~88.4. Using default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this is conservative given no confirmed lead-time shifts or sustained demand regime change and avoids overcommitting inventory while in-transit stock is still outstanding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent historical weekly demand samples show mean ~88.4 (5 samples: 79,80,88,115,80). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (matches orders 114+111) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet; this is consistent with promised L=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 will arrive during P3/P4 and be visible only in subsequent concludes). No sustained changepoint or evidence of lost shipments. Use default lead time to trust the promise, and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)*historical mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to set base stock. This balances service level (maintain pipeline coverage for current demand) vs. holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three orders (P1:114, P2:111, P3:77) still not arrived (arrived=0), on-hand=0 and in-transit=302 (sum of orders). Demands from sample window (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 88.4/wk. Because shipments have been missing for 3+ periods, I explicitly extend lead time to 3 to account for probable delay/loss risk. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the optimizer increase protection stock for the longer effective review+lead horizon while relying on historical demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (114,111,77) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0); suggests actual lead time > promised 2 or lost/delayed shipments (evidence: 3 consecutive periods of no arrivals).

Daily Profit: $252.00, Daily Holding Cost: $48.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-11. On-hand=48, in-transit=284. Recent concludes show one confirmed arrival: P2 order arrived in P4 with lead_time=2. Earlier P1/P3 orders experienced delayed visibility but P2 confirms actual lead time equals promised 2. Demand history (historical samples + recent periods) shows no sustained regime shift. I therefore let backend compute lead time from observed leads (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples. This balances service (use observed L=2) vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Historical weekly demand mean \u224888.4 from provided samples; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistent with promised 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) though some earlier orders were delayed/lost. Given limited evidence of a sustained demand shift and confirmed lead time=2, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (profit/holding cost ratio implies moderate safety stock) while avoiding overreacting to transient missing arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Historical demand samples (seed) show mean=88.4/wk. Arrival history: Period 4 conclude confirmed an order placed in Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2 (Period5 conclude also noted lead_time=2). Earlier no-arrival streak resolved with that confirmation, so use confirmed lead time. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect actual evidence (observed = 2). Use default demand scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend apply the standard base-stock formula across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (use confirmed L=2) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows an observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and no sustained evidence contradicting promised lead time; on-hand=0, in-transit=297 (covers pipeline). Demand history samples (weeks in Feb) show steady weekly demand. To keep the backend baseline forecast and let it use all historical demand, I select calculate for L (uses observed lead times) and default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service (q = profit/(profit+holding) => high fill target) while avoiding manual over-adjustment despite temporary missing arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand (Periods 4-8 = 63,105,95,78,108) averages ~89.8/wk, volatile but no sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=284 (covers multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times (P4 and P8) are 2 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To focus the forecast on recent realized demand I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the last 5 demand observations: P4\u2013P8) and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This yields a (1+L)-horizon mean based on current demand and a matched volatility for the OR engine to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand (last 5 periods: P5-P9 = 105,95,78,108,62) averages ~89.6; no clear sustained regime shift but volatility present. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (several past orders outstanding; some earlier orders were delayed but two concluded arrivals show lead time=2). Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 2-period realization. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the most recent demand pattern (covers review+lead period implicitly via backend multiplier) and limit exposure to older data. This balances service level (use recent mean to meet current demand) against holding cost (avoids using long-term higher means).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), P8 LT=2 (P6\u2192P8), P10 LT=1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2014 recent sequence [2,2,1] implying average ~1.67. Pipeline is large (284) so avoid inflating demand forecast; no clear sustained demand regime shift. Set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect most recent observed lead-time pattern. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, keeping forecasts conservative given mixed LT signals and sizable pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 7-11) = [78,108,62,63,56] (mean ~73.4) \u2014 demand appears lower than the early-Jan samples. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 289 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P9->P10)] -> mixed but average ~1.67. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1), I set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate) so the backend uses the empirical average rather than the promised 2. For demand I use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 7-11 mean ~73.4) and keep safety sizing responsive to current lower demand. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. Large in-transit (289) means orders placed now will add to pipeline; using recent data and inferred L helps avoid excess ordering while keeping service. Methods chosen: L=calculate, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand is high and variable (historical samples show weekly demands between ~62\u2013123, recent concluded demands: 110 at P12). On-hand=0, in-transit=289 \u2014 several earlier orders were delayed but later concludes show observed lead times of 2,2,1 periods (avg ~1.67). To account for actual lead-time variability I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L): this balances service level (given profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes or noisy single-period arrivals.

Given mixed but centered on 2 and substantial pipeline, set L to calculate (let backend use observed average). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set; this leverages historical demand while letting the OR engine target the profit/holding tradeoff via its service-level formulation. Defaults are conservative given in-transit stock and uncertain recent arrivals.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P10\u2013P14) = [63,56,110,77,97], mean ~80.6. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile moderate), I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 weeks) and avoid diluting with older data. These choices make orders responsive to recent demand while reflecting the slightly <2 average lead time seen in concludes; in-transit coverage will be reconciled by the OR engine.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,2,1,2 (majority 2) and earlier signals of delayed/lost shipments; recent confirms lead time ~2. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures slight variability but favors 2). For demand I use mu_hat='default' (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples using provided historical demand seed) and sigma_hat='default' (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps forecasting anchored to the full sample mean/variance while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time; given large in-transit (287) this avoids over-ordering while preserving service level under the confirmed ~2-period lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-times: 2,2,1,2 \u2192 overall average \u22481.75; demand last 5 periods = [110,77,97,60,57], mean=80.2. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 outcomes). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 demands, reflecting the current lower/volatile regime. Sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings ensure the OR engine targets service using recent demand while the calculated L captures actual observed lead-time behavior; the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded lead-times = {2,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.75; recent history shows mostly 2-period deliveries with one 1-period; pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demands. Profit= $4, holding=$1 implies a high target service level; to reflect observed lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed concludes so backend uses empirical average. Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to full history given no sustained demand regime shift). This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and high profit) against holding cost by letting OR engine apply its z* cap using observed stats.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical demand samples (seed) mean=88.4 over five Jan-Feb weeks. Observed concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13) with one 1-period (P9->P10); average observed LT ~1.75. To be robust to the confirmed multi-period evidence and align with promised lead time, I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate). I use default demand summaries for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set and the inferred L to set base-stock while the cap limits aggressive ordering given large in-transit. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost and the risk of delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (evidence: orders P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8, P11 arrived P13 \u2014 majority of observed arrivals = 2 periods).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 substantial pipeline already exists and likely covers multiple (L+1) periods of demand. Profit=$4, holding=$1 so q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 (high service target). I choose default lead time (promised L=2) because concluded history confirms L=2. I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this leverages the full historical sample set while the large in-transit position reduces urgency to up-weight recent variability. This balances service level and holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks (most recent demands: 45,39,36,33) but historical sample mean from provided seed data = 88.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 (sufficient pipeline cover vs. short-term demand). Concluded arrivals show majority lead_time=2 periods (evidence in Periods 4,8,13,19), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default demand sizing and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend applies the base-stock formula with the inferred lead time while leveraging all sample history; this balances service level given existing large in-transit inventory against holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been low compared with early periods (last 5 demands: 45,39,36,33,72 \u2192 mean ~45). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=287 units (covers multiple weeks at recent rates). Historical concluded lead-times are mostly 2 periods (several P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13 observations) so use calculated lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples so the OR engine sizes orders to current demand; using recent_N for sigma captures recent variability. This balances service (cover the L+1 review+lead demand) versus holding cost given the substantial in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead-times predominantly 2 periods with occasional 1; use calculated average to let backend weigh observed variability. Demand recently lower than early-sample spike but variable; use a recent_N mu_hat to focus forecast on latest behavior (reduces overstating demand). Use default sigma_hat to reflect overall observed volatility. These choices keep L responsive to observed arrivals while mu_hat recent_N tempers orders despite large in-transit stock, helping balance service vs holding cost.

In-transit (287) already covers roughly (1+L)*mean demand (\u2248265 units) so pipeline is sufficient; use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise and observed arrivals. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised 2; mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures baseline demand); sigma_hat=default to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (captures volatility). These settings signal the OR backend to order toward the usual base-stock while limiting excess given holding cost and current large in-transit quantity.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has averaged lower than early-period peaks (recent weeks: 72,89,72,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks but arrivals have been intermittent historically. Observed concluded lead times (from history) = {2,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.75. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the observed-average lead time. For demand/volatility I'll use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given current sizable in-transit inventory and modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical demand samples (seed) mean=88.4/week (samples: 79,80,88,115,80). Promised lead time=2 and past concluded messages consistently confirm lead time=2 for observed arrivals; no new prolonged loss signal. To keep OR engine aligned with promised lead time and use full sample history, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This yields a service-focused base stock (higher safety given 3-period cover) while relying on the OR cap to limit extreme orders; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to noisy recent zeros when substantial in-transit inventory (287) already exists.

Demand history across periods shows stable weekly demand roughly 30\u2013110. Given confirmed lead time and a large in-transit balance, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/variance (avoids overfitting to short recent swings) and lets the cap limit mitigate excessive ordering.

No robust, sustained demand regime shift detected (recent spikes are not 3+ period sustained), so use default demand estimates to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This keeps service-level sizing while avoiding overreacting to recent noisy spikes; large in-transit inventory will be reconciled by the backend's pipeline calculation.

Recent demand has risen vs early-sample mean (last 5 observed demands: P24-P28 = 52,92,93,179,140 \u2192 mean\u2248111). To cover review+lead (1+L=3) periods and reflect the recent higher demand regime, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock from the recent mean/volatility. No new confirmed lost-shipment pattern beyond previously recorded evidence.

Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but later periods confirm promised lead time=2 is appropriate. I choose default lead time (use promised L=2) and default demand estimators so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This leverages full-sample statistics, avoids overreacting to isolated lost shipments, and lets the capped ordering cap moderate order sizes given observed volatility.

Historical concluded arrivals show most observed lead times = 2 periods (multiple P\u2192P+2 arrivals) with one 1-period outlier; several earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent evidence supports LT=2. I set L using calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures dominant 2-period signal while allowing minor variation). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use default (backend uses all samples) to produce (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std \u2014 this smooths across the available historical samples and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods consistently (multiple confirmed arrivals at LT=2). Demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 27 (sustained for 6 periods). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (avg ~2). For demand, I use recent_N N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 27-32). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand periods. This also leverages the large in-transit stock (406) to avoid excessive new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 27: average demand P27-32 = 177.3 vs prior P20-26 = 71.9 (+146%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=598 (large pipeline from recent orders). Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 periods; promised LT=2. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 27 (much higher demand through Period 33). To capture the new higher demand regime, set lead time to default (promised=2) and estimate demand using the recent post-changepoint window. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect promised LT and confirmed historical pattern; mu_hat=recent_N and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to use Periods 27\u201333 (the detected regime of 7 periods) so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while accounting for observed volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead time = 2 (multiple confirmations). I set L to default (promised 2) since concluded history supports it. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (regime length P27-34 = 8), so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent high-demand samples. This balances service (higher forecast to avoid stockouts in new regime) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit volume.

Promised lead time = 2 and prior concluded arrivals confirm actual L=2, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (use last 9 post-changepoint samples P27\u2013P35) to capture the new higher-demand regime; this keeps the base-stock focused on current higher mean and variance while the backend cap will limit excessive single-period orders given pipeline.

To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 (regime length = 10 periods, P27-36) so the (1+L) demand forecast reflects the elevated mean. Volatility is similarly estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10. This keeps the backend base-stock driven by elevated recent demand while leveraging large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (much higher weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=757 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead-times are mostly 2 periods with occasional 1 and a single 3; I'll let the backend compute the average observed lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime for forecasting, I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent regime (Periods 27\u201337, length 11). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and sigma to reduce stockouts given high profit vs holding cost (profit $4 vs holding $1) while relying on the backend's capped ordering cap to limit over-ordering from the large pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent sustained demand regime (P27 onward) is much higher (noted previously). On-hand=0, in-transit=653 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover upcoming demand despite some past late arrivals. Observed arrivals historically mostly align with promised L=2 (majority =2); use default promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N to focus on the high-demand regime (most recent changepoint at P27). Regime length \u224812 periods (P27\u2013P38) so N=12. Use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders to meet the elevated demand while letting the backend cap limit excess replenishment given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (much higher weekly demand since then). On-hand=0, in-transit=750 which provides substantial coverage vs. elevated demand; recent arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1\u20133 variability. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time data rather than the promised default. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201339) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under the new regime) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=750. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,2,1,2,3,1 => avg\u22481.83) and a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 27 (higher weekly demand since P27). To reflect the empiric average lead time I let the backend compute the average from observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand I target the recent high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201340, regime length=14) so I ask the backend to base mu_hat on the most recent N=14 samples (recent_N) to capture the elevated mean across the review+lead horizon. Volatility should also reflect the recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=14. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position (750 units) which will be reconciled by the OR engine's capping rule.

Demand regime shift starting Period 27 (sustained higher demand); use recent_N for demand estimates using last 15 samples (Periods 27\u201341) to capture the new high-demand regime. sigma_hat also use recent_N (N=15) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock calibrated to the confirmed higher demand while grounding lead time on observed arrivals so orders cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand without excessive holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=703. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133) but majority ~2; demand shifted up starting Period 27 (sustained). To account for recent lead-time variability use recent_N for L (captures recent observed lead-times). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201342, 16 samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand reflecting the new higher regime. This balances higher service-level need (avoid stockouts given strong demand) versus holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than long-run low-demand mean.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/09 (Period 44). History of concluded arrivals shows variable lead times: recent concluded lead times (Periods 36,38,41) = {3,1,2} giving average \u22482. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 27 (higher demand through Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=763 (pipeline large). I set L via recent_N=3 to reflect the most recent realized lead-time average (captures recent 3 concluded lead times and is conservative given variability). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N=17 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201343). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=17 to capture volatility in the same recent high-demand regime. These choices balance service level (protect against ongoing high demand and variable lead time) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history; large in-transit reduces immediate aggressive ordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=763 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = {2,2,1,2,3,1,2} -> average ~1.86. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 27 (sustained); use recent demand samples to capture the higher mean/volatility. Choose L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (Periods 27\u201344 constitute an 18-period high-demand regime) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the elevated demand and its variability. This keeps orders aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the backend caps order size; using recent_N reduces stockouts during this sustained higher-demand period and avoids overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=653. Historical arrive messages show majority actual lead_time\u22482 (multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals, occasional 1 or 3). Demand shifted up starting Period 27 (sustained higher demand since P27\u201332 and through P33\u201336). To reflect persistent higher demand and observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals and use a recent-sample demand estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost by relying on recent demand samples rather than the long historical low-demand periods. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=708 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times predominantly 2 periods (multiple confirmations); occasional 1 or 3 but majority=2. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 27 (sustained higher demand through recent weeks). To capture this sustained higher demand I use a recent-N demand estimate over the most recent 20 periods (Periods 27-46) so mu_hat reflects the new regime and avoids under-ordering. For lead time I select calculate so the backend averages all observed lead-times (captures occasional 1/3 deviations while reflecting dominant 2-period behavior). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=20 to measure variability in the new regime. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts against higher demand) while the large in-transit pipeline and the backend cap limit holding risk.
