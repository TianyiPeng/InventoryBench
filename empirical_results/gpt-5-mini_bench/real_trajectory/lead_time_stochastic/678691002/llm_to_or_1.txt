Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Demand history (5 weekly samples) shows mean ~68.4/week; no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time change; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Use promised lead time (default L=2) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service (cover 3 weeks of expected demand) vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly samples (81,48,71,68,74) show mean ~68.4. Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order arrived=0), so no evidence to change lead time. In-transit=89 (ordered P1) likely to cover upcoming demand; on-hand=0 so keep OR using promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Using defaults lets backend compute base stock=(1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding) against holding cost given limited new evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand history mean = 68.4 units/week (samples: 81,48,71,68,74). On-hand=0, in-transit=176, and two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) have not concluded (arrived=0), suggesting lead time may be longer than promised 2 periods. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to allow the OR backend to cover a longer pipeline; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving historical demand signal while increasing coverage for the longer lead time and balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical demand mean ~68.4 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Three consecutive concluded periods (P1,P2,P3) show ordered=89+87+85=261 in-transit but arrived=0, indicating promised L=2 is not matching observed arrivals. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers additional delay, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand scaling (mu_hat default) and default volatility (sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with the explicit longer lead time; this raises order targets to protect against stockouts while capping orders via the backend cap to limit holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (89,87,85 => 261 units) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude; evidence of lead time >=3 or lost shipments. Treat actual lead time as 3 for planning until contradicted.

Daily Profit: $260.00, Daily Holding Cost: $22.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=22, in-transit=188. Historical weekly demand samples and the last 4 realized demands (P1-4: 56,60,54,65) show a lower recent mean than older samples. Multiple early orders (Periods 1-3) failed to conclude on time; treat lead time as 3 until contradicted. I set L explicitly to 3 to cover delayed/lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower-demand regime; mu_hat therefore targets (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 periods. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=4) so the OR backend will size safety stock to recent variability while the explicit longer lead time guards against overdue in-transit losses.

Carry-over insight: Lead time treated as 3 periods (evidence: orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by Period 3 conclude; plan as LT=3 until contradicted).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent sales have been moderate (period demands: 56,60,54,65,52) and on-hand=0, in-transit=222. Concluded history shows one observed lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived in P4) while other early orders remain missing; evidence is insufficient to confirm a persistent LT change. I set L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times \u2192 2) so the OR backend uses empirical lead-time info. For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all historical samples) capturing baseline demand across review+lead period. Sigma_hat set to 'default' to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (use observed LT and full-sample demand mean) vs. holding cost given current sizeable in-transit volume.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=188. Historical arrivals are inconsistent and earlier orders (P1\u2013P3) failed to arrive on time; prior carry-over treated LT as 3. Conclude explicit L=3 to be conservative against missing/lost shipments. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 captures baseline demand (mean historical weekly demand=68.4 \u2192 4\xd768.4). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect increased uncertainty with longer lead time. With L=3 the pipeline (188) is likely short of the 4-period demand forecast, so the OR engine will place replenishment to raise pipeline toward the base-stock while the longer LT limits exposure to lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=269. Historical concluded lead times show variability and some lost/delayed shipments; previous periods' conclude messages support treating lead time as longer than promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the cautious planning horizon given missing/late arrivals. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) to leverage full sample set and avoid overreacting to short recent noise; sigma_hat=default to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). This increases safety stock to cover the extended lead time while keeping parameters simple for the OR engine.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=190 (includes multiple earlier orders with mixed arrival history; some orders experienced long delays/losses while recent concludes show lead times of 2,1,1). I do not see a sustained (>3 periods) change to lock in an explicit LT; let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default demand/volatility scaling so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This balances service vs holding cost by letting observed lead time drive the review horizon while using full-sample demand stats (no clear recent demand regime shift).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent weekly demand samples (concluded periods) show typical weekly demand ~55\u201381 with mean \u224868. Promised lead time=2 but prior carry-over flagged delayed/lost shipments; plan conservatively with lead time=3 (treat as sustained until contradicted). On-hand=0, in-transit=211 (covers some future demand but arrivals are observed with a 1-period reporting delay). I set L explicit=3 to protect against the observed multi-period delays; mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = (1+3)\xd7mean to reflect review+lead demand; sigma_hat default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so the OR backend computes safety stock consistent with the longer assumed lead time. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) vs. holding cost by only increasing lead-time window, leaving demand estimate data-driven.

I will follow that conservative plan to avoid stockouts: set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, leveraging all historical demand while accounting for the longer effective review+lead period. No new sustained changepoint to add to carry-over.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows variable weekly demand (range ~32\u201381) and multiple delayed/variable arrivals: several orders exceeded promised LT=2 or arrived with LT=1\u20132, and in-transit = 268 units. On-hand = 0, so pipeline_inventory = 268 covers upcoming demand but prior periods show lost/delayed shipments; to be conservative I plan with a longer LT. L set explicit=3 to reflect sustained evidence of LT>=3 for earlier orders (Periods 1\u20133) and ongoing irregular arrivals. mu_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) using L=3, leveraging long-run sample mean (robust against short-term noise). sigma_hat set to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices increase target base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand given delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine use historical variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts given uncertain arrivals) versus holding cost by relying on the engine's z* tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=268. Historical concluded arrivals show some shipments delayed or lost (Periods 1-3 orders never arrived by Period 3 conclude). Maintain conservative lead time estimate to avoid stockouts. Set L explicitly to 3 (plan for 3-period actual lead time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concludes show several delayed/lost shipments (Periods 1-3 orders missing until at least Period 4) \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3 until contradicted. On-hand=0, in-transit=250 (pipeline large). Historical demand samples mean=68.4 (from provided series). With L=3, forecast demand across review+lead = (1+3)*68.4 = 273.6 units; use explicit mu_hat to ensure OR backend plans for the longer lead time and avoids stockouts despite pipeline uncertainty. Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed delays. Keep sigma_hat as default (backend will scale historical std by sqrt(1+L)) so variability is accounted for without overfitting to short-term noise. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost while acknowledging overdue shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals and confirmed longer effective lead time; carry-over recorded treating actual lead time as 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=300. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed/treated lead time (orders have been arriving later than promised or delayed). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (most recent 8 observed weekly demands) to capture the current regime without over-weighting older samples; mu_hat is therefore (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 demands, providing a 4-week coverage. For uncertainty I use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than the entire historical period. These choices bias ordering toward covering the longer confirmed lead time while using recent demand statistics to avoid overstock from older higher-demand weeks.

To be conservative and cover the longer arrival behavior, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, yielding a base-stock that covers the review+lead period while balancing profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-4) and provided carry-over indicate actual lead time appears to be 3 periods (orders from P1-3 did not arrive as promised). To be conservative, set L explicitly to 3 so the backend plans for review+lead coverage = 1+L = 4 periods. Demand signal is noisy with many stockouts and no clear recent sustained demand regime change; use default population-based demand estimates so the OR engine leverages all samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat rather than overfitting to recent, possibly censored observations. This balances service level (longer LT coverage) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent realized weekly demand has settled lower (~45 units/week over last 5 weeks: Periods 13-17 = 47,36,66,37,40, mean=45.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (large pipeline). Prior carry-over concluded lead time=3; treat as LT=3 for planning. Choose L explicit=3 to enforce that planning horizon. For demand across review+lead (1+L=4), use recent_N N=5 to capture the most recent regime (4\xd7mean of last 5 weeks \u2248180.8) so orders reflect current lower demand. Use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. With in-transit=300 > forecasted (\u2248181), no urgent replenishment expected; these parameters reduce over-ordering while preserving service under confirmed LT=3.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concludes show many late/missing arrivals earlier; current on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~68.4; given confirmed prolonged delays, I plan as lead time = 3 to be conservative. Set L explicit=3 so backend computes (1+L)-horizon forecasts with longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*historical mean and sqrt(1+L)*std (robust given limited demand samples). This keeps orders sized to cover 4 weeks of expected demand while letting OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive inventory given current large in-transit; balances service level and holding costs amid observed shipment delays.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent observed demand (periods 15-19): [66,37,40,40,55] \u2014 elevated and variable versus the small historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (undelivered). Historical conclude messages indicate shipments have been delayed; prior evidence supports treating actual lead time as 3 periods until contradicted. I set L explicitly to 3 to capture the observed multi-period delays. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the latest regime (these 5 most recent demand observations) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 5). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. This approach biases orders to cover the longer effective pipeline and recent higher demand while keeping variability estimates grounded in the most recent regime so the OR backend can compute a higher base stock without overreacting to older Jan samples.

To be conservative and ensure the pipeline covers upcoming demand given observed delays, set lead time explicit=3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies the base-stock calculation consistently with the longer lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/uncertain LT) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* using profit/holding cost.

Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, keeping demand estimate stable given no clear recent demand regime shift and leveraging all historical data to smooth weekly variability.

Recent demand has shifted lower vs early-year; I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to base forecast on the most recent 6 weeks (demands: 40,40,55,51,25,38) and use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Demand recent regime: last 5 weeks (Periods20-24) demands = [51,25,38,48,24], mean=37.2; use mu_hat recent_N N=5 so backend computes (1+L)*mean over these recent samples to capture current lower summer demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concludes show persistent delayed/lost shipments; following carry-over guidance I plan with lead time = 3. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 25,38,48,24,29; mean=32.8) captures current regime; with (1+L)=4 I use recent_N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current short-run demand pattern while accounting for elevated lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 27 (2019-08-12): on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concludes show shipments delayed/lost and prior carry-over insight treats actual lead time as 3; continue planning with LT=3. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust to noise given limited recent receipts). This balances service (using longer LT) vs holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to plan for extended lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures full-sample demand while scaling for the longer review+lead period). This increases ordered pipeline to cover the extra lead time and mitigates stockouts from lost/delayed shipments while balancing holding cost via the backend's capped policy.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent concluded history shows long run of zero visible arrivals after many early orders; current on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Prior carry-over indicates actual lead time treated as 3 periods due to late/missing arrivals\u2014plan conservatively. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed effective lead time. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture full review+lead demand based on available historical weekly demands. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) for volatility. This combination increases required base stock to cover the longer inferred lead time while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff and the cap logic to limit overshoot given current pipeline of 300 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows sustained arrivals delayed early (Periods 1-3) and prior carry-over treated actual lead time as 3; on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Given confirmed evidence of LT\u22483 (orders from P1-3 failed to arrive by P3 conclude and subsequent planning already used LT=3), I set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all historical weekly demand samples; this scales the demand forecast and uncertainty for the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost while respecting the capped order logic. No new carry-over pattern identified.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent concluded history shows many late/missing arrivals earlier and prior carry-over guidance treats actual lead time as 3 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=300. To guard against underestimated LT and avoid stockouts, I explicitly set L=3. Demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb weekly: 81,48,71,68,74) will be used by backend; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative multi-period forecast and volatility for the capped base-stock rule given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times with recent evidence (Periods 1-3 shipments missing in early concludes) \u2014 planning assumes longer lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained signal of LT>=3 from prior concludes. Demand has shifted from the small Jan sample set; I use recent_N (last 5 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current recent demand regime (more representative weekly demand). These choices ensure the OR backend targets stock for (1+L) periods using current demand levels while accounting for increased lead time risk; recent_N volatility keeps safety stock responsive but not overly large given holding cost $1/unit.

Given prolonged intermittant arrivals/lost shipments earlier, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): historical weekly mean (samples 81,48,71,68,74) = 68.4. Carry-over evidence indicates treating actual lead time as 3 periods (missed arrivals for P1-3 and prior note). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 which covers (1+L)=4 periods demand (4*68.4=273.6) so no immediate replenishment required. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed/assumed LT=3. Set mu_hat explicit to (1+L)*mean_all = 4*68.4 = 273.6 to match OR engine demand-across-review+lead. Use sigma_hat default (let backend compute sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This keeps service level aligned with observed lead-time risk while avoiding excess ordering since pipeline already exceeds forecasted coverage.

No new sustained demand regime or lead-time evidence in recent weeks (demand low but not a 3+ period shift). On-hand + in-transit = 304 which likely already covers the 4-period forecast; using explicit L=3 ensures the backend scales mu_hat appropriately and avoids placing excessive new orders given substantial pipeline. Carry-over insight preserved from history; no additional new insights.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-5) show delayed/variable arrivals and prior analysis treated actual lead time as 3 periods; many orders after Period 3 did not conclude on schedule. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (large pipeline). To be conservative against lost/delayed shipments, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (leveraging full history) \u2014 this lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost while the large in-transit volume will cap orders via the engine's pipeline-aware cap.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand 0, in-transit 300. History shows multiple concluded lead times = 1\u20133 with sustained late arrivals including Period 36 order arriving in Period 39 (lead_time=3). Prior carry-over treated LT=3; continue treating actual lead time as 3. Use L explicit=3 to protect against further delayed arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201339 = 12,19,17,34,25) better reflects current regime than whole-sample mean, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weeks). This balances service (covering (1+L) periods under current demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ($4/$1).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. History of concluded arrivals shows actual lead time behaving as 3 periods (orders from P1-P3 did not arrive by P3 conclude; later P36 arrival had lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 \u2014 sufficient pipeline to cover several review+lead periods at current demand. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Demand has fallen materially in recent months (Periods 36-40 demands: 19,17,34,25,26); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, keeping orders aligned with the lower recent demand regime and avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical conclude messages show multiple multi-period arrivals (notably orders that effectively exhibited 3-period delays), and prior carry-over noted treating lead time as 3 until contradicted. To be conservative versus lost/long LT risk, set L explicit=3. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine compute base_stock and cap based on observed stats. This balances service (longer LT coverage) against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a confirmed lead-time disruption (previous carry-over: treat actual LT=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Demand recent five concluded periods (P38-42) = [34,25,26,30,123] (mean=47.6) \u2014 includes a large spike (123) from late-Nov event; I use a short recent window to adapt to this regime while keeping responsiveness. Set L explicit=3 to plan for the longer observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime over the last 5 periods (backend will compute (1+L)*mean). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock due to LT=3 and recent elevated mean) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap rule and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent concluded history shows variable but often \u22652\u20133 period lead times and prior carry-over flagged actual LT=3 (Periods 1\u20133 orders did not arrive on-time; Period 39 arrival implied 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed historically, so plan with LT=3 to be conservative. Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) to avoid overfitting to sparse recent variability while the LT uncertainty persists. This balances service (higher L increases (1+L) safety stock) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with at least one confirmed 3-period lead time (Period 36 order arrived Period 39) and earlier evidence of orders not arriving by promised LT=2 (Periods 1-3). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 (plan for longer lead time until contradicted). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical weekly demand samples; this leverages full sample history while the larger L inflates demand-across-review+lead scaling to maintain service given q=0.8. In-transit (300) will be reconciled by the system; no new forced demand-regime adjustment due to lack of sustained recent shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical conclude messages show sustained irregular/extended lead times; prior carry-over treated LT=3. Recent weeks show a holiday demand spike (Periods 42 and 45 large: 123 and 211) so forecast should upweight recent samples. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed shipping delays. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent elevated demand (holiday regime) over the review+lead horizon. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to preserve service during confirmed high-demand weeks while reflecting higher variance to avoid stockouts given uncertain arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical conclues show unusually long/missing arrivals; prior periods indicate actual lead time \u22483. Set L explicit=3 to capture observed delays. Recent demand spike in Dec (periods 42-46: 123,22,9,211,185) gives a 5-period mean=110; with (1+L)=4 I set mu_hat explicit=440 to cover the review+lead horizon. Demand volatility from those 5 samples \u224892.1, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 \u2192 sigma_hat explicit\u2248184.2 to reflect high uncertainty. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher target stock to avoid stockouts given long lead times and recent high demand, while acknowledging holding cost via the backend cap.
