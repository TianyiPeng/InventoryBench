{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 \u2014 year-end/holiday season (post-Christmas, New Year) which often drives elevated apparel demand but can drop after Christmas returns. Demand analysis: recent 3-week demand is very high (Period42=123, P45=211, P46=185) => recent average ~173 units/week, a clear short-term spike vs prior months. Lead time / pipeline: in-transit=844 units (large) and history shows highly variable/occasionally delayed lead times; several past large shipments were delayed before concluding. Given large in-transit volume that may still arrive and the risk of lost/delayed shipments, avoid adding inventory that increases costly holding ($1/unit/period) during uncertain arrival timing. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 so there is current stockout risk if in-transit fails to arrive immediately, but ordering now faces promised 2-period lead time with observed variability. Decision logic: prioritize avoiding excess holding cost given huge in-transit pipeline and lead-time unreliability; do not place additional order this period and monitor arrivals next period to reassess.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Seasonal peak confirmed for Dec: Period42=123, P45=211, P46=185 (avg=173 over these 3 weeks) \u2014 sustained high demand during late-Nov/Dec holiday period.",
