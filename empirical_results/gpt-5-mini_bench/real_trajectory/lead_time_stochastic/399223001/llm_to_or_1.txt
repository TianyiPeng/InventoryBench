Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Historical sample mean \u2248260.6 (5 weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb). No sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised (2). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean \u2248260.6 (samples: 258,233,280,234,298). On-hand=0, in-transit=308 from Period 1 order which has not concluded yet; with promised lead time=2 we cannot infer an actual lead-time change from a single missed arrival. I therefore keep L at the promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock using the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (covers (L+1) periods) while avoiding premature increases in forecast or safety stock based on one delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=624 (orders 308+316). Concluded history shows arrived=0 for Periods 1-2 but those conclude messages are expected given promised lead time; no concluded arrivals observed yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Demand history (5 samples, mean\u2248260.6/wk) shows no clear changepoint. To avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock calculation. This balances service level (cover (1+L) periods) against holding cost while retaining responsiveness if shipments are lost (will revise when arrivals conclude).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~260.6/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=803 which equals sum of prior orders (308+316+179) but no concluded arrivals yet; insufficient evidence to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments. Use default promised lead time to avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use all samples) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=139, in-transit=487. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=260.6/wk. Concluded arrivals show the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time observed=2); other earlier orders have not concluded and may be lost, but evidence is limited. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirms promised 2). For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=611. Historical concluded messages confirm at least one observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and recent orders remain in transit (some arrivals pending). Given the confirmed LT evidence, set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses empirical average. Demand history (five weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019) will be used by default scaling for mu_hat and sigma_hat; use default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR engine compute base_stock while respecting the promised lead-time input. This balances service (using observed lead-time estimate) against holding cost given profit=holding, and leverages the full sample set since no sustained demand regime change is convincingly present.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=608. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 showed order placed P2 arrived P4 (LT=2); Period6 showed order placed P5 arrived P6 (LT=1). With mixed evidence, use the backend's lead-time estimator (calculate = average of observed lead times) so L reflects recent variability. Demand history includes the provided weekly samples (258,233,280,234,298) plus recent realized demands in concludes; to avoid overfitting to a short recent window I select default demand estimators so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and sizable pipeline (608 units) while letting the OR engine apply its statistical safety stock logic.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=720. Recent demand history shows a large spike (Period 7 demand=343) but overall historical samples are limited. Observed lead times in concluded history: 2 periods (P2->P4) and 1 period (P5->P6). I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 2 obs). For demand and volatility I use default (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) because the spike is recent and not yet a sustained regime change; defaults provide a conservative aggregated forecast and let the OR engine compute the base-stock tradeoff with known profit/holding costs. This balances service level (captures observed lead-time variability) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=513. Historical demand samples (given) mean=260.6. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed leads = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)} -> avg=1.5. Promised lead time=2 but observed variability (1\u20132) suggests using the empirical average. Set L by calculation to let backend use observed mean lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand stats across (1+L) periods (keeps forecasting anchored to historical demand while accounting for inferred lead time). This balances service (by increasing coverage for >1 period lead) vs holding cost given profit=holding so backend's q will be conservative.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=743 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 or 2) but no sustained change across 3+ periods; promised lead time remains the best default. Use default demand estimates (all samples) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; with large in-transit inventory this avoids aggressive new ordering while letting backend compute safety stock given profit/holding parity.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=144, in-transit=487 \u2014 ample pipeline but past arrivals show inconsistent lead times (observed concluded lead_times = 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). To be conservative about actual lead time variability I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for shorter/longer arrivals. Demand history (seed samples mean \u2248260.6) is limited and recent on-floor sales are noisy without a sustained regime shift, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults (use all samples) to avoid overfitting to recent spikes. This balances service level (using an empirical L) against holding cost by not inflating demand estimates unnecessarily.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=554. Historical concluded demands (Periods 4-11): 177,188,201,343,237,159,112,178 \u2014 no clear sustained regime shift but recent volatility is higher than the early-sample mean. Promised lead time is 2 periods and prior evidence confirmed a 2-period lead in Period 5; use the default promised L to keep the OR engine aligned with contract lead time. Use a recent_N estimate for demand (N=8, covering the most recent 8 concluded demand samples) so mu_hat reflects the current higher-variance demand environment and short-term trends. Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat so safety stock scales to observed recent volatility. These choices ensure the backend sets base_stock using recent realized demand and increases safety stock to protect service while avoiding excessive long-tail carry given holding cost parity with profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=599 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history shows variable weekly demand with several stockouts; no new sustained lead-time shift (previous insight confirmed LT=2). To avoid overreacting to noisy spikes while reflecting the latest demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (captures the last 5 concluded demand observations) and keep L at default (promised lead time=2). This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while the cap limits excessive ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=532 units. Recent concluded history shows arrivals consistent with promised lead time=2 (carry-over insight already recorded). Pipeline (532) likely covers multiple future periods; avoid aggressive ordering. Profit=1 and holding=1 imply service quantile q=0.5 so backend will target mean demand. I select default L (use promised lead time=2) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma. This is conservative given mixed short delays observed and no new sustained regime shift.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=626. Historical weekly demand has declined from winter; recent 5-week demand (Periods 10-14 = 112,178,205,149,172) avg=163.2. Lead-time observations are mixed but earlier carry-over confirmed L=2; I will use promised lead time (default). To reflect recent demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current mean and volatility over last 5 observed demands). This prioritizes matching inventory to current demand while keeping safety stock for 2-period lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=626. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed = 2,1,2,1,2,2), so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times rather than relying on the promised 2. Demand history available (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019 plus ongoing periods) so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock using full sample set. This conservative choice prevents overreacting to short noisy swings while the large in-transit position reduces need for aggressive uplifts; averaging lead time captures the mixed 1\u20132 period reality and helps the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical concluded lead times largely center on 2 (carry-over confirmed at P5); no sustained new lead-time signal, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 205,149,172,138,122) shows a lower-demand regime vs earlier spikes; use recent_N=5 to capture current mean/volatility for the (1+L) review+lead demand. These parameters keep pipeline sized for current demand while limiting holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR engine adapt to the mixed pattern (use 'calculate'). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available demand samples; this balances service vs holding cost given uncertain/variable arrivals and large in-transit stock.

Observed lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods in concluded history; use the calculated average lead time to let the backend infer the best L. To react to the recent downward drift versus earlier high peaks, forecast demand using a recent-window mean (captures the current regime) and match volatility to the same recent window. These choices balance service (using recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Concluded lead times in history show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations; using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. Demand history is reasonably stable around prior samples so use default demand and volatility calculations (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (by adapting L to observed deliveries) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

On-hand=0, in-transit=626 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating long-run forecast. Use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 6 weeks to capture the new lower mean and volatility. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will make the OR engine size orders to cover (1+L) periods of this lower demand while reducing holding risk given high pipeline.

Recent observed demand has been low-moderate (last several weeks: 111,48,85,109,102) after earlier higher spikes; on-hand=0, in-transit=626 which is a large pipeline that should cover multiple weeks. Historical concluded lead times include mostly 2-period arrivals (Period 5 insight already recorded). Given no clear, sustained demand regime change and a large in-transit position, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std. This avoids overreacting to short noisy weeks while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula to limit excessive replenishment and balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand (Periods 18-23) averages ~107/week with moderate variability; seasonality: summer weeks show steady mid-hundreds earlier but recent weeks lower than early-year peak. On-hand=0, in-transit=626 units have not produced any 'arrived' conclude in the last several periods despite promised L=2 \u2014 evidence of prolonged missing/delayed shipments. Because in-transit stock appears unreliable, I explicitly inflate lead time to give the OR engine a conservative pipeline window (explicit L=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 18-23) where mean demand is lower than the historical early-year sample; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of overstock from phantom in-transit quantities while aligning base-stock to current realized demand.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: 626 units shown in-transit have not concluded by Period 24 (no arrivals for > promised 2 periods) \u2014 treat these in-transit units as likely lost/delayed until confirmed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 but those in-transit units have not concluded for > promised LT and are likely lost/delayed; confirmed observed lead times from concluded messages vary (observed LT samples: 2,1,2,1,2,2,1) so I will let the backend compute an average lead time from observations. Recent demand has fallen from early peaks to mid-range weekly values (recent concluded demands: 111,146,146,60, prior 85/48/109...), so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current regime. Choices: L=calculate to reflect observed average lead time (not trusting promised LT alone); mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent 5 demand samples; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to estimate recent volatility. This approach reduces reliance on the large in-transit quantity (likely lost) while letting the OR engine set safety stock appropriate to recent demand and observed lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has fallen and stabilized vs. the historical winter/spring mean: last 8 concluded demands (Periods 18-25) = [109,85,48,111,146,146,60,112], indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=626 (these in-transit units have been outstanding > promised LT and are likely lost/delayed; do not rely on them). Promised lead time remains 2 periods so use default L to keep OR engine aligned with contract. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (N=8 chosen as the length of the recent stable regime, >=3). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders, limiting holding cost risk given likely lost in-transit stock while preserving service for the current lower-demand level.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 units that have been outstanding > promised lead time and flagged as likely lost/delayed in prior carry-over. Historical concluded lead time evidence includes confirmations of 2-period lead (Period 4) and some 1-period arrivals; however promised lead time remains 2. Demand history is limited to the provided samples; no new sustained demand regime (3+ periods) is confirmed since the last recorded insight. To avoid overreacting to the large in-transit anomaly (likely lost), I keep L at the promised/default value so the OR engine uses its usual lead-time assumption, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand mean/volatility from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service-level targeting against holding cost without trusting the broken in-transit signal as supply.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 (likely delayed/lost per prior carry-over). Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms occasional 2-period lead times; no new concluded arrivals since Period 24. Demand in the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 23-27: 146, 60, 112, 182, 193) shows a higher and rising short-run mean. I keep L at the promised/default to avoid over-adjusting from missing (unconcluded) shipments and let the backend use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 so mu_hat reflects the latest regime; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon given recent higher demand while not assuming recovered arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 units that have not concluded for many periods (likely lost/delayed per prior insight). Recent observed demand (Periods 24-28) = [60,112,182,193,200] \u2014 materially higher and more volatile than the early-sample history. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because no new concluded arrivals have confirmed a different lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher demand regime and its volatility, so the OR engine increases base-stock and caps appropriately to restore service while recognizing holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 units that have been outstanding since Period 24 and should be treated as likely lost/delayed (no new conclude). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132), with an earlier confirmation of 2. Demand history shows typical weekly demand in the 100\u2013300 range. I choose to use the promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses its assumed L=2; I also use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this is conservative given uncertain/lost in-transit stock and avoids overreacting to apparent short-term noise. This balances service vs holding cost without relying on the likely-lost 626 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent observed demand (Periods 26-30: 182,193,200,137,225) is materially higher than the Jan 2019 sample mean (~260/3\u2248260) pattern and represents a sustained summer demand regime; many earlier shipments are missing (626 units in-transit with no conclude since Period 24) so treat those as unavailable. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 5 evidence) and promised lead time is 2, so keep the backend's promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 5 weeks: Periods 26-30). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and increases safety stock while avoiding reliance on the likely-lost in-transit units, balancing service level vs holding cost under profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=626 units appear delayed/lost per prior insight, so do not rely on them. Use a conservative longer lead time to cover potential supplier delays. Set L explicitly to 4 (longer than promised 2) to force larger (1+L) coverage in the forecast. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand weeks. This balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=holding so the OR backend will compute a risk buffer from recent demand volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand samples show elevated demand (recent weeks: 225, 328, 356) but historical series (Feb\u2013Feb) is the basis for estimates. On-hand=0, in-transit=958; several past shipments have failed to conclude (carry-over notes: missing/delayed shipments since Period 24), so treat in-transit as uncertain but include in pipeline for this period. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 (Period 5 evidence) and promised lead time is 2. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses promised L and the full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L); this avoids overfitting to a short recent spike and lets the backend compute base_stock and cap while acknowledging the engine is unaware of lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=958 (many earlier in-transit units flagged as delayed/lost at Period 24). Recent demand has shifted higher (Periods 28-33: 200,137,225,328,356,401) \u2014 I treat this as a new high-demand regime. Use observed concluded lead times to estimate actual lead time (avg of observed lead times \u22481.56). Set L to be calculated from observed lead times. For demand forecast use a recent_N window to capture the elevated recent regime (N=6 covering Periods 28-33). Use same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (higher forecast for strong recent demand) against holding cost; lost/delayed in-transit units are treated as unreliable so forecast does not rely on them.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent weekly demand has risen: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [225, 328, 356, 401, 284], avg \u2248 318/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=958 but many past shipments have not concluded since Period 24, implying shipment delays/loss risk. Promised L=2 has been unreliable; to be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover potential extra delay. Forecast demand across review+lead set using recent 5-week regime: mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 to capture elevated recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Volatility also uses recent 5 weeks: sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise target base-stock to protect service level given elevated recent demand and possible delayed arrivals while keeping holding cost in mind (profit=holding so q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Additional missing/delayed shipments: as of Period 35, 958 units are in-transit with no conclude; treat these as likely delayed/lost until confirmed.

To be conservative, set L by aggregating observed lead times (method=calculate). Use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost and uncertain/drifting lead times and preserves robustness to single-period anomalies and missing shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has rebounded (Periods 32-36 demands: 356, 401, 284, 262, 322) and on-hand is 66 with 626 units shown in-transit that previous carry-over flagged as likely lost/delayed. I treat lead time as the recent average of observed lead times to capture variability (some 1-3 period observations recently) so the OR backend will expand coverage for uncertain arrivals. For demand I use a recent-N forecast (last 5 periods) to reflect the current higher-demand regime rather than older low-demand samples. For volatility I also use recent-N (last 5) to align safety stock with recent variability. These choices push base stock up to protect service during the recent high-demand window while limiting excess holding from older low-demand history and accounting for suspected lost in-transit units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime has risen since ~Period 30 (several weeks of 200-400 demand), so I use a recent-sample demand estimate. On-hand=0, in-transit=909 with multiple earlier long delays/lost shipments (Periods 24,35 notes) \u2014 pipeline likely unreliable, so adopt a conservative longer lead time to cover delayed arrivals. Choices: L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period arrival (Period 32\u219235) and ongoing shipment delays; mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the higher-demand regime from Period 30\u201337; sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 for volatility in the same recent window. These params bias orders up to cover the elevated recent demand and delayed pipeline while keeping variability-based safety stock consistent with recent variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=990 but history shows multiple delayed/missing shipments (carry-over notes). Recent observed lead times (most recent 3 concluded arrivals) = 1, 1, 3 \u2192 short-term average \u22481.67, so I set L to recent_N to reflect the recent variability and bias toward faster arrivals while acknowledging occasional 3-period delay. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples, giving a demand forecast scaled to the chosen lead-time while leveraging full sample history. This balances service (by increasing coverage for the >1 lead-time) against holding cost, and avoids overfitting to noisy short bursts given known missing/delayed shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=990; history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) and multiple long-unconcluded in-transit batches suggesting some lost/delayed shipments. I select L as 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures historic variability including the recent 3-period observation) and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples. This balances service level (using observed lead-time mean) against holding cost without overfitting to short recent spikes or uncertain in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent concluded history shows unstable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) and a sustained demand uptick beginning around Period 32 (Sept) \u2014 recent weeks show much higher weekly demand than earlier periods. To capture true lead-time behavior I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I anchor on the most recent regime (periods of elevated demand starting at P32); I use recent_N on the last 9 samples to reflect the new higher mean and volatility so the OR base-stock balances service vs holding cost under current demand.

Given mixed evidence but no clear recent stable shift, use calculated average lead time from concluded arrivals to let backend infer typical L. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and lets OR engine compute z* automatically.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=990 (some prior in-transit shipments long-delayed/lost). Concluded lead-time observations (from arrival records) show varied lead times with average \u22481.58; use calculate to let backend set L = average observed lead time. Recent demand has shifted higher starting around Period 32 (sustained higher weekly demand from P32\u2013P42); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering P32\u2013P42) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the new higher regime while accounting for observed pipeline uncertainty. This balances service level (capture elevated recent demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=990 (many in-transit units long overdue per history). Lead times have been variable (observed 1\u20133 periods) and there are signs of lost/delayed shipments. To account for true realized lead-time variability I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times from concluded messages. Demand historical samples are limited to early-2019 weekly sales; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this is conservative given uncertain arrivals and avoids overfitting to recent noisy periods. These choices aim to raise the pipeline target when average observed lead time is above promised, while not inflating demand estimates despite missing arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=990 with history of delayed/lost shipments (Periods 24 & 35 notes). Recent concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133) and several late/no arrivals; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover observed delays. Demand has risen in recent months (higher weekly demand since Sept; holiday spike in late Nov). I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (last 8 demand observations) so the OR engine targets a higher base stock reflecting current elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N=8 captures recent volatility. These choices aim to increase service level given uncertain/delayed pipeline while balancing holding cost via the capped order cap in the backend.

Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=1086 (many prior long-delays recorded); no new sustained lead-time confirmation since Period 35\u2014use promised lead time. Recent calendar: late Dec holiday demand elevated (Nov\u2013Dec weeks show higher demand). To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat via recent_N using the last 12 demand samples to bias base-stock upward for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Keep L at default (promised=2) and sigma_hat at default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaling. This balances higher service need for the holiday window against holding cost given equal profit/holding.
