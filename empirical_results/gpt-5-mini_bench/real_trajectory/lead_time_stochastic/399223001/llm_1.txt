Lead time & reliability: promised LT=2 but observed variable (1\u20133) and past supplier reliability issues; some in-transit units have arrived late historically. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1837 (pipeline large but partially unreliable). Economics: Profit = $1/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 holding a unit one extra period erodes profit fully; therefore avoid excess inventory and target minimal safety stock to capture demand while minimizing end-of-period holding cost. Order logic: place a modest replenishment to insure against potential stockouts when some in-transit units fail to arrive on schedule, but avoid large order due to 1:1 holding cost. I target roughly one week of expected holiday demand (~300) as a conservative buffer given pipeline size and reliability concerns.",

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=2137 units (per Period 46 conclude) \u2014 pipeline already exceeds the 3-period coverage target by ~1384 units. Lead-time / reliability: history shows variable actual lead times and prior supplier reliability issues, but current in-transit is large. Ordering logic: avoid additional orders to limit holding cost (holding cost = profit = $1/unit/period); existing in-transit is sufficient to meet near-term demand and will be costly to hold if increased.
