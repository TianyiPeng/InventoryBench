{
  "rationale": "Context & objectives: Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), so overstock is costly; aim to cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand while accounting for possible lost/delayed shipments. Lead-time & pipeline: Promised LT=2; concluded history shows LT has been 1\u20132 (no sustained LT change). Some past orders were lost (carry-over insight: Period 1 order 200 appears lost), and in-transit=460 likely includes at least one unreliable shipment. I therefore treat only a conservative portion of pipeline as reliable. Demand assessment: Long-run historical mean (five samples) implies high demand, but recent weeks show a much lower regime (carry-over insight from earlier periods). Recent 6-week average demand = (163+221+171+83+109+139)/6 = ~148 units/week; using this as the best current estimate. Target coverage: Target inventory = 3 \xd7 recent weekly mean \u2248 3\xd7148 = 444 units to cover current period + LT. Reliable pipeline: I conservatively count 260 units as reliable (likely from Period 17 order) and treat the remainder of the in-transit 460 as possibly unreliable due to past lost shipments. Decision math: Order_needed = target(444) \u2212 reliable_pipeline(260) \u2212 on_hand(0) = 184 units. Cap/OR baseline: OR recommended 40 (it uses older historical mean and promised LT); I increase above OR to ensure 3-period coverage given current demand regime and risk of lost shipments. Operational note: This order hedges against lost/delayed shipments while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = profit.
