Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Demand history (weekly): 64,36,45,52,56 (through 2019-02-04). No 'Period conclude' messages yet to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Promised lead time=2; with no evidence to contradict it, use default lead time and default demand volatility/forecast methods so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(samples) \xb1 std adjustments. This balances service level (covering the next 3 weeks of observed average demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 50.6 (samples 64,36,45,52,56). On-hand=0, in-transit=69 (order placed P1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time default to avoid premature adjustments. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample stats, balancing service level against holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=137 (orders P1=69, P2=68). Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) avg demand \u224850.6. Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet; cannot confirm a lead-time shift or lost shipments (concludes for P1/P2 will appear in future periods). Be conservative: use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps policy aligned with historical baseline while accounting for L in the backend calculations and avoids overreacting to pending in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=177. Historical weekly demand mean \u224850.6 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded by their expected windows (see concludes), indicating promised L=2 is unreliable (possible longer lead time or lost shipments). To protect service level I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative extension), and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing fill rate vs holding cost given elevated lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 failed to arrive by their expected conclude windows: P1 ordered=69 arrived=0 (should have arrived by P3 conclude). Indicates lead time >2 or lost shipments; treat lead time as extended until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed lead time observation: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed LT=2. Period 1 order remains missing (may be lost) but we have at least one confirmed LT=2, so use calculated average of observed lead times to reflect realized service. On-hand=32, in-transit=166; with promised LT=2 and observed evidence of LT=2, use L="calculate" to let backend average observed Ls. Demand history (samples mean \u224850.6) and L=2 imply (1+L)=3 review+lead window; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (uses observed LT) while avoiding overreacting to the one missing shipment; default stats provide stable safety stock given limited new demand signal.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=166. Historical concluded arrivals show at least one order with lead_time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4) but several earlier orders did not conclude on time (possible lost/delayed). Evidence is not sufficient to confidently change lead-time estimate; use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its observed-average logic. Demand history (recent and sample series) centers near ~50 units/week; use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs holding cost given uncertainty about missing shipments and the existing in-transit volume.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has softened since Period 4 (P4-6 demands = 36,37,28; recent mean ~33.7) versus earlier higher weeks. Multiple early orders (P1-P3) failed to conclude on-time and one P2 order concluded with lead_time=2, suggesting promised LT=2 is unreliable; to be conservative I set lead time = 3 (explicit). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower recent demand regime (captures last 3 observed demands) so the OR backend targets a smaller (1+L)-period forecast and tighter variability, limiting excess holding given holding cost > profit ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has been high and variable (recent concluded weekly demands: P4=36, P5=37, P6=28, P7=35) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=169. Observed concluded lead time(s): order from P2 arrived in P4 => lead_time=2. Several earlier orders (P1,P3) did not conclude by expected windows suggesting possible lost shipments, but only one clear lead-time observation exists so use the average observed lead time. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead_time=2. For demand, use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) based on historical sample mean (stabilizes forecast across available history). Use default sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility. These choices give the OR backend a demand coverage of (1+L) periods while remaining conservative about presumed lost shipments and avoiding overreacting to short-term gaps.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Concluded arrivals show two observed lead times: P4 conclude (P2\u2192arrive) lead_time=2 and P8 conclude (P6\u2192arrive) lead_time=2; earlier P1/P3 shipments appeared lost/delayed but recent concluded evidence supports using the observed average. Demand history (most recent 8 periods) shows variation across Feb\u2013Apr; to reflect current regime I use recent-N demand estimates (N=8) for mu and sigma so the OR engine focuses on the latest demand pattern while L is set by the average of observed lead times.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Observed concluded arrivals show two confirmed lead times of 2 periods (P2->P4, P6->P8); some earlier orders (P1,P3) appear lost/delayed but recent evidence supports LT=2. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift from seed samples. I set L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 2-period behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/4/22. On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 periods (orders from P2 and P6 arrived with W=2); some earlier orders were lost but recent evidence supports lead time=2. Demand has fallen versus winter: use a recent demand window to capture current lower mean/volatility. Choose L by calculating observed average lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the current regime and limit over-ordering given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Recent concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times = 2 (arrivals in P4 and P8 from orders placed 2 periods earlier), while several early orders were lost\u2014so treat lead time based on observed concludes. Demand has shifted down from the Jan historical samples (~50s) to a sustained lower regime across Periods 4\u201311 (values: 36,37,28,35,55,34,24,39; recent mean ~36). To reflect confirmed lead time evidence use calculated average lead time=2. To adapt to the new lower demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the 8-period recent regime). These choices let the OR backend compute a base stock that respects the observed lead time and reduced demand while reducing excess holding from older higher-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand history (12 weekly samples) shows mean ~41.8 units/week with moderate volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=166. Concluded arrivals (P4: P2 order arrived with lead_time=2; P8: P6 order arrived with lead_time=2) confirm actual lead time consistent with promised L=2 despite earlier lost shipments (P1,P3). I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this leverages full historical demand to size the base-stock while the large in-transit position (166) will be accounted for by the pipeline subtraction, avoiding overordering given holding cost>0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Historical concludes show multiple lost/ delayed arrivals (P1 ordered=69 arrived=0 when it should have by P3), while some orders observed have lead_time=2 (P2->P4, P6->P8). Given prolonged missing arrivals and large in-transit, I conservatively increase assumed lead time to 3 to avoid under-ordering. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples) so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock/cap. This balances service level (longer L increases mu_hat) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has moderated vs. initial weeks; last 10 observed weekly demands (P5\u2013P14) average ~33.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=196; several early orders failed to conclude on-time indicating occasional lost/delayed shipments\u2014so I conservatively treat lead time longer than promised to avoid stockouts while in-transit is large. Set L explicit=3 to buffer against further unseen delays. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and risk estimate reflect the most recent regime (captures recent lower mean and observed volatility) and scales with (1+L) in the backend. This balances service (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand rather than all historical spikes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 periods (orders P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). Recent order activity (P14 ordered=30) has not yet concluded and may arrive per promised lead time. Given consistent observed lead_time=2 and lack of sustained evidence for change, set lead time method to calculate (uses observed lead times). Demand history seed is limited to provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap with standard statistics while accounting for the calculated lead time. This balances service level (using observed L) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 periods (orders: P2->P4, P6->P8); earlier missing arrivals suggest lost shipments but recent evidence supports lead_time=2. Use L='calculate' to lock in observed average lead time=2. For demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples\u2014this balances service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (q=0.8) and avoids overreacting to intermittent lost shipments or zeros in recent periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen to ~20\u201335 units (last 6 periods: 35,24,25,20,20,22 avg\u224824.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 units; many earlier orders were delayed or lost (P1\u2013P3 orders failed to conclude on time), so actual lead time appears extended. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative given repeated late/missing arrivals (promised=2 but shipments frequently arrived later or not at all). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (focus on last 6 observed demands) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. These choices reduce excess holding risk while ensuring pipeline covers the longer effective lead time and current lower demand, balancing profit vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed extended lead time: multiple orders failed to arrive by promised windows (P1\u2013P3 orders missing; sparse arrivals thereafter). Treat lead time as \u22653 periods until arrivals confirm shorter lead time; recent demand regime lower (avg\u224824.3 over last 6 periods).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has settled lower than initial samples (last 6 demands: P13\u2013P18 = 24,25,20,20,22,24). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 (some earlier orders delayed; multiple orders failed to conclude on schedule \u2192 evidence actual lead time >=3). Choose L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time and avoid underordering. Use mu_hat recent_N N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent, lower-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce excess stock risk from overestimating demand while accounting for longer arrival delay so pipeline target covers the extended lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 6 demands: 25,20,20,22,24,9; mean=20). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 \u2014 pipeline is large but past orders have been delayed/lost; historical concludes show some orders taking \u22653 periods or not arriving. To avoid underordering when shipments are delayed, explicitly set lead time L=3 (conservative, matches confirmed extended lead time). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime. This yields mu_hat based on the last 6 weeks (scaled by 1+L) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility, letting the OR backend size orders to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under the confirmed extended lead time and recent lower demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical concludes show many orders missing/delayed beyond promised L=2; carry-over evidence (Periods 1\u20133 missing; Periods 14\u201320 sparse) supports treating lead time as extended. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed prolonged deliveries (conservative extension to cover observed \u22653-period delays). Demand has shifted lower recently (avg \u224824.3 over last 6 periods); I use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most recent regime. This balances service (uses recent lower mean to avoid over-ordering) while the elevated in-transit and extended L prevent stockouts from unobserved arrivals.

======================================================================

Multiple prior orders failed to conclude on promised windows; recent concluded arrivals and long gaps indicate lead time extended \u2014 treat as 3 periods to cover observed delays. Recent demand has declined; using recent_N on last 6 periods (P16\u2013P21) captures the lower regime (mean demand ~16). Chosen params: L explicit=3 to guard against missing/late shipments; mu_hat recent_N (N=6) to base forecast on the recent lower-demand regime across the review+lead window; sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to keep pipeline sufficient for (1+L) periods while avoiding excess holding given holding cost >0.

Historical concludes show multiple missing/late arrivals and prior carry-over concluded lead time extended (Period 18): treat lead time as 3 until arrivals confirm otherwise. Recent demand has downshifted versus early-Jan samples; use recent_N=6 to capture current low-demand regime (most recent demands: P17\u2013P22). Setting L explicit=3 forces the OR backend to plan for the longer pipeline; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat uses the latest 6 periods to size (1+L)-period demand and volatility, reducing overstock risk while providing service for the observed low-demand regime.

Recent demand has settled lower (avg \u224824.3 over last 6 periods), so I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. With L=3, (1+L)=4 so mu_hat will target 4\xd7 recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This leverages the 196 units in-transit (reducing new order size via OR cap) while maintaining service during the sustained lower-demand regime.

On-hand=0, in-transit=196 units but many past orders were delayed\u2014evidence of extended lead time (missing arrivals through Period 18).

To be conservative and cover delayed shipments, set explicit L=3. Recent demand has been lower (avg \u224824.3 over last 6 concluded periods), so use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime and recent volatility. This balances service (longer L to account for delays) against holding cost by forecasting demand over (1+L) with recent data rather than older high-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand has settled lower (last 6 demands avg \u2248 24.3: periods 23\u201328 = 17,11,16,15,18,31) and on-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical conclude messages (many missing arrivals through Period 18) indicate promised L=2 has been unreliable and prior carry-over flagged lead time \u22653. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover the extended/uncertain transit performance. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent lower-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over the last 6 observed demands). These choices raise target base-stock modestly for service given in-transit stock while avoiding overstock if demand remains low and holding cost applies.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent observed demand is in a lower regime (avg \u224824.3 over last 6 periods per prior insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 (outstanding shipments from earlier periods that have not yet concluded). Historical concludes showed extended/uncertain lead times (missing arrivals through Period 18); treat lead time as extended. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time (>=3) until new conclude evidence arrives. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6 samples respectively). This keeps target base-stock aligned with current observed demand while accounting for longer lead time and the sizable in-transit pipeline to avoid overstocking if shipments arrive.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent observed demand has been lower than early-period highs (last 6-period avg \u224824.3) but volatile (e.g., 18,31,9,59). On-hand=0, in-transit=196; several earlier orders failed to conclude on schedule, so treat lead time as extended. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time (\u22653) from prior conclude history. Use mu_hat recent_N N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent stable regime (captures the lower recent mean \u224824.3 and short-term volatility). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent demand variability for safety stock. These choices align the OR backend to hold inventory for a 4-period coverage while limiting excess holding given the lower recent demand and observed shipment delays.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical concludes show multiple delayed/lost shipments with confirmed extended lead time (see carry-over). Recent demand has spiked in the last two periods (P30=59, P31=85); using a short recent window captures this regime change while still covering the extended lead time. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed \u22653 periods lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the latest 6 demand observations (captures recent uptick without overreacting to a single week). These parameters bias orders upward to protect service during the apparent longer lead-time while keeping variability estimated from the short recent window to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 but prior concludes show multiple orders delayed/lost and a confirmed extended lead time (Periods 1\u20133 missing; Period 18 flagged). To avoid understocking given missing arrivals, treat lead time as extended this period. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed \u22653-period behavior. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes demand across review+lead from full sample history; this leverages all data while the longer lead-time parameter forces larger pipeline coverage. This balances service (cover longer uncertain transit) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical conclude messages show multiple missed arrivals and prior carry-over confirmed extended lead time (>=3); treat lead time as 3 to avoid assuming promised 2. Recent demand regime is lower (avg \u224824.3 over the last 6 concluded periods) but with some high spikes; to capture current regime use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility. Choices: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 6 most recent demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes (Periods 1\u20134, 6, and notably Periods 1\u20133 missing by Period 4 and Periods up to 18) confirm extended lead time \u22653; recent demand regime has shifted up sharply in Periods 30\u201334 (demands: 59,85,71,116,95). To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent elevated demand regime (Periods 30\u201334), which balances service (capture spike) against holding costs given high in-transit stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 Period 36. On-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical concludes show multiple missing/delayed arrivals since Periods 1\u20133 and carry-over confirmed extended lead time \u22653 (Period 18). Recent demand regime appears lower in mid-year but late Aug\u2013Sep shows spikes; nevertheless sustained evidence supports treating lead time as extended until arrivals prove otherwise. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed extended lead time. For demand I use recent_N N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the lower mid-year average referenced in carry-over while still reacting to recent variability). These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts from delayed shipments while keeping holding costs controlled by using a short recent-sample forecast rather than all-time mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=23, in-transit=312. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P35->P36) \u2014 mixed but recent single-period arrival present; earlier periods had missing/lost shipments so we cannot treat lead time as permanently >2. I set L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1 and prior 2s). Demand history is volatile with recent large spikes but also many low weeks; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so the OR engine uses all samples for (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the averaged lead time and profit/holding ratio.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concludes show lead times have been inconsistent and previously confirmed extended (Period 18); recent arrives (P36 order arrived in P36 conclude with lead_time=1) but multiple earlier missing shipments imply uncertainty. Demand has shifted upward starting Period 30 (2019/9/2) with high weekly demand through Period 33 and elevated volatility thereafter; I detect a changepoint at Period 30 with a recent regime length of 8 periods (P30\u2013P37). To be conservative on service while acknowledging prolonged/variable lead times I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (covers observed extended delays). For demand I use recent_N over the last 8 samples so mu_hat reflects the current higher-demand regime and sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture recent volatility. These settings aim to raise base-stock to meet higher recent demand while the longer L guards against delayed arrivals and lost shipments, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical conclues show prolonged/delayed arrivals and earlier analysis (Period 18) confirmed lead time \u22653; recent arrivals have been irregular. Given confirmed extended lead time, set L explicit=3 to reflect the longer effective lead time until shorter LT is reconfirmed. Recent demand has spiked in the last 5 periods (Periods 34\u201338: 95,69,43,87,88; avg\u224876.4) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime; (1+L) scaling in the backend will produce a multi-period demand forecast. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect elevated recent volatility. With in-transit=351 > forecasted (1+L)*recent mean, this should avoid new orders while covering near-term demand and limiting holding cost exposure until arrivals and lead time reconfirmation occur.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical conclude messages show persistent delayed/lost shipments earlier and Period 18 confirmed extended lead time \u22653; recent demand has shifted up sharply from mid-2019 lows to high weekly demand in Periods 30\u201339 (last 10 demands: 59,85,71,116,95,69,43,87,88,76). To protect service while accounting for confirmed extended lead time, I set L explicit=3. To capture the recent high-demand regime (most relevant for replenishment) I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (uses last 10 samples) so the backend builds base_stock for the current high-demand regime and volatility. This balances higher service (given large in-transit and observed demand spike) against holding cost while acknowledging earlier shipment delays.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical conclude messages show multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier and a prior confirmed extended lead time (\u22653); in-transit volume is large so treat lead time as extended until new concludes prove otherwise. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed longer lead-time risk. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from the full sample history (conservative pooling) while the larger L raises required pipeline coverage and service level automatically.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical concluded arrivals show occasional 1\u20132 period leads but prior missing shipments and carry-over indicate lead time has been extended; with large late-Nov demand spikes (periods 36\u201341: demands = 43,87,88,76,73,72) I target a conservative lead time of 3 and forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended/uncertain lead times and ensure pipeline covers extra periods. For demand, use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-season mean (periods 36\u201341 mean\u224873) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the OR base-stock up to meet holiday demand while acknowledging holding cost via the backend cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical conclues show confirmed extended lead time (multiple orders missing by promised windows) and carry-over noted a lower recent demand regime (avg \u224824.3 over last 6 periods). To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime rather than long-run historical averages; this keeps the base-stock tied to current lower demand while the longer L protects against delayed arrivals and avoids overstocking given holding cost >0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=498. Historical conclude messages show multiple delayed/missing shipments and prior confirmed extended lead time (\u22653); recent demand (Periods 38-43) averaged \u224898.8/week (6 weeks) with a large spike at P42 (212) indicating elevated seasonal demand in early December. To protect service during this elevated-demand window and given confirmed extended lead time, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. I set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u22484\xd799 \u2248396 units (targets higher availability across review+lead), and keep sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for the peak while letting the backend compute safety stock from historical volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

History shows many delayed/missing concludes and prior analysis (Periods 1\u201318) confirmed extended lead times \u22653; pipeline is large but uncertain due to past lost shipments. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time risk (protects against assuming promised 2). Given substantial historical demand variability and the OR engine's defaults, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while accounting for the longer review+lead horizon. This balances service (longer L raises required base stock) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=35, in-transit=351. Recent concludes show observed lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P35\u2192P36), 2 (P43\u2192P45)} => average \u22481.75. Earlier periods signaled missing/extended shipments, but recent arrivals are mostly 1\u20132 periods. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures recent 1\u20132 period behaviour). Demand volatility and mean will be left to the backend defaults (use all samples) so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the full sample history; this is conservative given recent noisy/episodic spikes (e.g., large seasonal demand in Nov/Dec). These settings balance service (use observed shorter lead times) versus holding cost given sizable pipeline inventory.

Concluded arrivals show mixed observed lead times (some 1, some 2), so I let the backend compute the empirical average observed lead time (calculate). Demand has had bursts (Nov/Dec) but no new sustained regime change since prior insight; use default demand/volatility across all samples so the OR engine applies the full history-weighted base stock. This balances service (given large pipeline) against holding cost while letting OR cap orders via its cap rule.
