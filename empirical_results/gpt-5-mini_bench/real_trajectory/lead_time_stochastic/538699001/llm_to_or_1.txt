Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [98,95,128,120,190] (mean \u2248 126). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for review+lead period. No concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time (2) is used. No clear sustained changepoint despite the 190 spike (single week), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (critical fractile 0.5 \u2192 neutral safety stock).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=190 (ordered Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 arrival delayed or lead time \u2265 promised but no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248126.2/week; with promised L=2 I use default estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling and its safety-stock formula. Using defaults avoids overreacting to a single delayed arrival while keeping supply coverage for the review+lead period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand in Periods 1-2 (292, 265) is much higher than historical sample mean (\u2248126), suggesting a potential upward demand shift, but this signal is short (2 periods) and not yet sustained. Two prior orders (190, 272) are in-transit totaling 462 units and on-hand=0. I will use the promised lead time (default) because concluded arrivals do not yet confirm a lead-time change. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; in-transit inventory (462) modestly exceeds the default (1+L) demand forecast, providing temporary cover while we await more concluded evidence before changing forecasts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=510 (orders: P1=190, P2=272, P3=48) and none have concluded as arrived in any conclude messages. Promised lead time=2 but orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived by their expected conclude periods, indicating actual lead time is longer or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 to cover the observed delays. Demand history (five weekly samples mean=126.2) will be applied across the review+lead period; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using L=3. This raises target base-stock to improve service given missing arrivals while keeping volatility estimated from history.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained shipment delays: orders placed P1(190), P2(272), P3(48) have not arrived by their expected conclude periods; treat actual lead time as >=3 periods until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=104, in-transit=419. Historical weekly demand samples mean=126.2 (samples: 98,95,128,120,190). Recent conclude shows P2 order (placed P2) arrived in P4 => observed lead_time=2. P1 remains overdue but we have one confirmed 2-period arrival, so use observed lead-time average. Set L by calculation (average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand samples show elevated weekend/early-Mar demand (historical weekly mean=126.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=419 (matches outstanding orders P1=190, P3=48, P4=181); P2 arrival in Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 2. Earlier delays (P1,P3) persist in-transit but one confirmed 2-period arrival reduces need to adjust promised L. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and recent demand has risen vs. the older 2019-Jan samples (recent concluded demands: P4=168, P5=150, P6=233). On-hand=0, in-transit=510 (some prior shipments still expected). To capture the recent higher demand regime while respecting the promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised=2) and set demand estimates using the most recent 3 concluded demand observations (Periods 4\u20136). This raises the forecasted review+lead demand and the demand volatility so the OR backend will target higher base stock and account for increased uncertainty, reducing likely stockouts given in-transit/outstanding shipments and prior lost-arrival issues.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=551. Historical baseline samples (Jan-Feb) show mean\u2248126/unit-week, but recent realized demand for Periods 4-7 = [168,150,233,248] indicates a sustained upward shift. Lead time was confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2\u21924); no strong evidence of >2 now. To raise service during the higher-demand regime while accounting for promised L=2, I set L=default (use promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher mean over the last 4 periods; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased variability. These choices push the backend to a larger base stock appropriate for the elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with confirmed observation, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 4-7 average demand = 199.75 vs prior sample mean \u2248126.2 (+58%); sustained for 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted higher (Periods 4-8 elevated; P8=313). On-hand=0, in-transit=468 (multiple outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1 \u2192 average \u22481.67; use calculated average to let backend adapt to observed variability. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the most recent elevated demand regime (captures recent spike while smoothing older low-demand samples). These choices aim to increase target base-stock to meet higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=668. Historical concluded lead times observed: P2->P4=2, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1; average observed lead time ~1.67 but most evidence supports a 2-period lead time. Demand has shifted up since Period 4 (carry-over recorded); recent realized demand (Periods 5-9 = 150,233,248,313,240) remains elevated. I choose L by calculation from observed concluded lead times to let the backend reconcile slight variation vs promised L=2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=5) so the OR engine raises target base stock and accounts for increased variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weeks show sustained elevated demand vs. early-sample mean (periods 4-10 largely 150\u2013313, recent average well above historical Jan samples). Current inventory: on-hand=47, in-transit=462 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirmed actual L=2; therefore use default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (focus on the most recent 6 demand periods to reflect the sustained uplift). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock forecast to meet higher short-term demand while the large in-transit stock limits over-ordering via the OR cap.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=646. Historical concluces confirm actual lead time = 2 in several observations; use promised/default L to align with supplier. Demand has experienced a sustained upward regime (Periods 4-11: recent demands = 168,150,233,248,313,240,202,175); choose recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher mean for (1+L)-period demand. Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These params raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while the cap prevents excessive single-period ordering given holding cost = profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=649. Historical concluded lead-time observations: orders concluded show lead times = [2,2,1,2,1] (avg 1.6), so actual LT is around 2 but slightly below on average. Demand has been in a higher regime since Periods 4-8; recent demands (Periods 7-12 = 248,313,240,202,175,211) average ~231.5, confirming sustained elevated demand. Given confirmed higher demand and large pipeline, use a recent_N demand forecast to capture the new regime while letting the OR engine combine with its lead-time model. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average observed Ls). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect the most recent elevated demand mean/variance. This balances service level (capture the new higher mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=18, in-transit=511. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 2 periods (multiple P arrivals: P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13). Demand has shifted up vs early-sample: recent demands (Periods 9-13 = 240,202,175,211,166) average \u2248198.8, consistent with earlier detected regime (Periods 4-7 avg 199.75). To reflect the sustained higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures latest regime while limiting noise). I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals consistently support L=2. These choices raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent variability balances service level vs holding cost; using recent windows also mitigates effects of past low-demand samples and the earlier transient missing arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with some 1s; average observed lead time ~1.7. Recent demand (Periods 8-14) remains elevated and volatile (samples: 313,240,202,175,211,166,177; mean \u2248212). To capture actual lead-time experience I ask backend to calculate average observed L. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime and current volatility I use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 7 demand samples). This biases replenishment toward meeting elevated demand while keeping volatility-based safety stock to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been on a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained spike through Periods 4-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=636 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 average ~1.71. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed-average lead time. Demand forecast uses recent data to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: mu_hat -> recent_N with N=12 (Periods 4-15) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new normal. Volatility also set to recent_N N=12 to reflect recent variance. These choices help the OR engine raise the base-stock for the sustained higher demand while accounting for the empirically observed lead time and current large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since the confirmed regime shift around Periods 4-8; latest concluded demands (Periods 9-16) remain high (many ~200+). On-hand=0, in-transit=636 \u2014 substantial pipeline covers multiple periods but arrivals are observed with actual lead times mostly 1-2 periods historically. I set L to 'default' (promised 2) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time \u22482 and no new evidence of >2. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the most recent 8 demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat from recent samples controls safety stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times: {2,2,1,2,1,2,2,2} -> average ~1.75; recent pattern mostly 2. Demand regime increased starting Period 4 and has remained elevated (~200s). To reflect actual observed lead-time pattern, set L by calculation (average observed). To capture elevated recent demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit: OR engine will cap orders, and using recent statistics prevents over-ordering based on older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Demand has shifted up vs early-sample mean (recent weeks avg ~180+ vs prior ~126); on-hand=0, in-transit=581 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 periods and recent concluded arrivals mostly match LT=2, so use default promised L to keep OR engine aligned. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using a recent_N window to weight recent elevated demand (N=6 covers the most recent periods including the confirmed regime). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime earlier but recent weeks remain elevated; to avoid overfitting to short windows while leveraging all data, use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=577. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but predominantly 2-period realizations with some 1-periods; recent observed lead times (most recent 9) average ~1.67. I choose recent_N for L to capture this recent realized lead-time behavior and avoid relying on promised value. Demand has varied since the early-spring spike; the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21 = 181,125,204,158,79) average ~149.4, so I select recent_N for mu_hat to adapt to the latest regime while avoiding overreacting to single large weeks. Volatility has also shifted recently, so I set sigma_hat as recent_N with the same N to reflect current variability. These choices (recent-N lead time and recent-N demand estimates) help the OR backend size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand given some late/early arrivals while avoiding excessive holding cost against a demand mean that has moderated from prior spikes.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Recent realized demand has dropped sharply (Periods 21-23: 79, 55, 35). Observed concluded lead times (from arrivals) average \u22481.7 periods (multiple 2s and some 1s). Given the clear recent downshift in demand (3 consecutive lower periods) and substantial pipeline inventory, I choose to let the backend use an inferred average lead time (calculate) and to forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new lower regime. Using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces ordering driven by older high-demand periods and limits holding costs given high in-transit volume. This balances service (avoid stockouts if drop reverses) with holding cost minimization.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand decline confirmed: Periods 21-23 avg = 56.3 vs prior Periods 1-20 avg \u2248153 (\u2248-63%); sustained for 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weeks show a sustained demand decline vs earlier periods (Periods 21-24 low: 79,55,35,23). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=576 units (covers multiple future periods). Observed concluded lead times center on 2 periods; no new evidence to change. Set L=default to use promised 2. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods (Periods 21-24) via recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine lowers target base-stock and avoids excess holding given the large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent sustained demand decline: last 5 periods (P21-P25) demand = [79,55,35,23,17], mean=41.8, well below historical (~126). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times center near 2 (promised=2) and prior periods confirmed LT=2; no new sustained LT shift. To match the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding, keep promised lead time (default) and downweight older high-demand samples by using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covers the 5 most recent periods showing the decline). This yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast reflecting the new low demand while allowing the OR engine\u2019s cap to limit order size given large in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent sustained demand decline confirmed in Periods 21-23 (avg ~56) vs earlier avg ~153; on-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show actual lead time centered on 2 periods. To avoid overstocking given heavy pipeline and lower recent demand, use promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime. L set to default (promised=2). mu_hat set using recent_N with N=3 to target the most recent 3-period low-demand regime. sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders down to preserve profit vs. holding cost while the large in-transit volume covers near-term demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 with a confirmed decline around Period 24; last four demands (Periods 24-27) = 23,17,27,28 (avg=23.75). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 periods; no new evidence of change. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (captures most recent 4-week average across review+lead). For volatility I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect lower recent variance. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and low recent demand, reducing holding costs while meeting likely low demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has fallen and remained low since Period 21 (weekly demands: 79,55,35,23,17,27,28,18). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline) \u2014 no immediate replenishment needed beyond matching the new low-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 2 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To align base-stock with the recent low-demand regime, set demand estimates using the last 8 weeks (Periods 21-28) so the OR backend reduces order quantities and holding cost exposure. Use the same recent window for volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has fallen and stayed low since Period 21 (weekly demands: 79,55,35,23,17,27,28,18,24). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Past concluded messages confirmed actual lead time = 2. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility over the last 9 periods (Periods 21-29) while keeping L as promised (default). This lets the OR engine target a lower (1+L)-period demand forecast and reduced safety stock, avoiding excess holding given the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 2 periods recently and promised lead time=2; use default L to keep OR engine aligned. Demand has fallen and remained low since Period 21: Periods 21\u201330 demands = [79,55,35,23,17,27,28,18,24,13], avg \u2248 31.9 (sustained 10 periods). To reflect the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 10 periods so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty to current low demand, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service. L: default to use promised lead time=2. mu_hat: recent_N N=10 to capture sustained decline. sigma_hat: recent_N N=10 to capture current lower volatility. In-transit (576) is large relative to expected (1+L)*mean_recent \u2192 this will cap orders via pipeline subtraction; using recent estimates prevents new over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand decline: Periods 21-30 avg = 31.9 vs Periods 1-20 avg \u2248153 (\u2248-79%), sustained for 10 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent sustained demand decline persists (Periods 21-30 avg \u224831.9 vs earlier \u2248153). To align forecasting with the new low-demand regime I set L to promised (default=2) and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 10-period low-demand regime (Periods 21-30). This reduces target base_stock and volatility estimates so the OR backend will limit ordering and avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service for the low-demand environment. In-transit units (576) are large relative to recent demand; using recent estimates prevents further over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historic concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods repeatedly (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P15->P17, P18->P19, P20->P22, P8/P9->P10). Demand has undergone a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (Periods 21-32 average \u224828.5 over 12 weeks). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (2), but for demand statistics I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (N chosen = regime length capped rules). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will make the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 12 samples, reducing target base-stock and cap to avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (carry-over: avg Periods 21-30 = 31.9 and Periods 21-23 = 56.3 earlier), with the last 13 concluded weekly demands (Periods 21-33) consistently low. Lead-time evidence from concluded history repeatedly matches the promised 2-period lead time (several P->P+2 arrivals); no new sustained lead-time shift is observed. To avoid overstocking given Profit=Holding ($1/$1) and the prolonged demand decline, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 13 samples (captures the current low mean across review+lead period) and set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 13 samples (captures recent low volatility). This biases orders toward lower base stock and reduces holding costs while maintaining service for the current demand level.

Historical concluded lead-times show frequent 2-period arrivals; no new evidence to change promised lead time. I set L=default to use promised lead time=2. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 21-34). This biases the OR base-stock toward the current low demand, while leaving lead time as promised so arrivals in-transit still count in pipeline calculations.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical conclues show actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed earlier) and recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 21. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained post-Period-20 decline (Periods 21-35) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent low-demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=15 to reflect reduced volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep orders sized to the current low-demand regime while preserving the backend's safety-cap calculations and avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (confirmed in carry-over): recent weekly demand (Periods 21-36) is much lower than earlier periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-time evidence repeatedly shows 2-period arrivals (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13, P15\u2192P17), so use promised/default lead time. To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, I base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=16, Periods 21-36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock tuned to current low demand while the cap limits per-period receipts relative to average. This leverages the large in-transit pipeline and prevents ordering for the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 with updated decline confirmed in carry-over (Periods 21-30 avg 31.9 and continued low values through Period 37). On-hand=0 but in-transit=576 units\u2014pipeline is large relative to current low demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Use promised lead time (default=2). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N focused on the recent low-demand regime to avoid legacy high-demand bias; choose N=17 (Periods 21-37 available) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 17 samples. This keeps orders aligned to the current low-demand regime and limits excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (recent weekly demands ~5\u201328, avg << historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 units \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to current low demand, so use promised lead time and base demand estimates from the recent low-demand regime. Chose L: default (use promised 2). Chose mu_hat: recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (avoid inflating forecast from earlier high-demand periods). Chose sigma_hat: recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent low-demand volatility. These parameters keep the OR backend focused on the current low-demand regime and avoid additional ordering while the large in-transit pipeline converts to on-hand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Periods 21-30+ (carry-over insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time to keep model aligned with supplier terms while pipeline is monitored. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent low-demand regime (use last 10 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine reduces replenishment given the large in-transit quantity and low current demand. This avoids excessive holding cost while preserving service for small ongoing demand.

On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline from prior orders) \u2014 do not inflate lead time. Set L to promised (default=2). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the sustained low-demand regime (use last 20 samples covering Periods 21-40). This keeps base_stock aligned with the new low demand while the large in-transit pipeline will cover near-term demand and avoid excess additional orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (confirmed earlier): recent 20-week window shows much lower average demand than historical. No new evidence of lead-time shifts; past confirmations set actual lead time = 2 in earlier periods. To avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and sustained low demand, keep L at default (use promised lead time) and set demand estimates using recent_N over the last 20 samples so the OR backend will base base_stock on the current low-demand regime and reduce future orders. Chosen methods: L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=20), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has most often been 2 periods and prior carry-over confirmed a sustained demand decline starting Period 21 (avg lowered substantially). To avoid excess holding cost while matching the recent low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand from the most recent 20 concluded demand samples (capture the sustained low-demand regime). Volatility also estimated from the same recent 20 samples so the OR backend sizes safety stock to recent variability.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (documented carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and recent conclude messages support LT=2 historically. I choose L=default to use promised lead time. Demand forecast should reflect the sustained lower regime: use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 21-30 regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 10 samples). Volatility should also reflect recent lower-variance behavior: sigma_hat recent_N N=10. These settings reduce target base-stock to match the new lower demand while the large in-transit quantity prevents immediate stockouts; the choices balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals with some 1s; average observed LT \u22481.7. Demand has a sustained low regime since Period 21 (confirmed Period 31 insight). To respect recent low-demand regime and reduce overstock, set L via calculated average of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to base forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (captures Periods 25\u201344 and earlier decline). This reduces target base stock relative to long-run mean while the OR backend still applies its service-level cap.

On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (no overdue evidence; recent arrivals matched promised L=2). I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use last 20 samples to forecast (1+L) demand). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep targets small to avoid excess holding cost while covering the low recent demand and the 2-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical concluded arrivals mostly support promised L=2 (multiple observed lead_time=2); no new sustained lead-time change. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (carry-over insight from Periods 21-30 and onward). To reflect the persistent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (captures latest 20 weeks of the low-demand regime) and recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. Keeping L=default ensures OR backend uses promised lead time while mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect current low-demand reality, reducing excess holding given holding_cost equals profit.
