Pipeline (245) already covers the 3-period demand estimate and slightly exceeds it, so placing additional order risks extra holding cost.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR suggests 87 units based on base-stock logic. However OR uses promised lead time and historical stats only and doesn't see current in-transit. Given pipeline sufficiency (245 \u2265 234), the OR order would likely create unnecessary inventory and holding cost.\n\nDecision: Do not order this period (order = 0).
