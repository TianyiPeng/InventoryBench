Recent December weekly demand (P43\u2013P46) averaged \u2248112 units/week; Black Friday spike at P42 (404) is a one-week event. Demand regime: recent sustained elevated regime detected earlier (recorded through P42) and Dec weeks average ~110\u2013130, so forecast ~120/week. Lead time/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Historical conclude messages show variable/extended lead times with some shipments delayed but some arriving with LT=1\u20132; many earlier orders remain in-transit per carry-over. Risk: additional ordering now likely creates extra holding cost while large in-transit qty should cover several weeks of expected demand. Calculation: expected demand next 3 weeks (L+1 with promised LT=2) \u2248360 units < in-transit 600, so no replenishment required. Action chosen to avoid unnecessary holding cost given existing pipeline and uncertain arrivals.",
