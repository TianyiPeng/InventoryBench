Period 1 conclude showed arrived=0 for the 330 ordered in P1, but that alone does not prove a lost shipment or shorter lead time (need 3+ periods of evidence to record a change). The system currently reports In-transit=330 and On-hand=0. Treat the 330 as pipeline but recognize it may not have arrived yet.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand & OR baseline: Historical weekly demands average \u03bc\u0304 = (267+298+307+189+122)/5 = 236.6 units. For review+lead (1+L=3) expected demand \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 709.8 units. OR recommended 352 units using its capped base-stock logic (it uses promised L and historical demand).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory coverage target: To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand we want pipeline + on-hand + order \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 710. Current pipeline 330 + on-hand 0 = 330, so additional \u2248 380 units needed to reach target (710\u2212330\u2248380).

To avoid stockouts across the 3-period horizon while not overstocking (holding cost $1/period, profit $4), I will top up to the 3-period demand target rather than strictly follow OR's slightly lower capped recommendation.\n\nDecision: Order 380 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed earlier as 2 periods (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1055. Demand outlook: recent weeks (P39-46) average \u2248333/wk; (L+1)=3 periods demand \u2248999 units. OR base-stock cap recommended 0. Since pipeline (1055) > expected coverage (\u2248999), no additional order is needed now. Risk: variable supplier lead times (1\u20133 observed) and occasional lost shipments exist, but current in-transit buffer exceeds the (L+1)-period demand plus small safety margin, so place 0 units to avoid holding cost.",
