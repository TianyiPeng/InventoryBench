Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 464297007 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or evidence of changed lead time; historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show no sustained regime shift. Use promised lead time and population statistics: L=default to keep promised 2-period lead time, mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample demand and avoids overreacting to short-term variability, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean ~236.6. An order of 367 is in-transit (ordered Period 1) but has not concluded/arrived yet, so no evidence to change promised lead time (2) or demand regime. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the model conservative given lack of concluded arrivals and avoids overreacting to a single delayed shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=719 (orders from P1 and P2). No concluded arrivals observed yet, so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014treat promised lead time as valid. Recent realized demand (P1=159, P2=373) shows volatility but only 2 new points (insufficient to declare a regime shift). Use default lead time and default demand moments to let the OR backend apply historical sample stats while avoiding overreaction to limited recent noise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (from history) are high and variable (159, 373, 301 observed demands in early periods; historical 2019 Jan samples: 267,298,307,189,122). On-hand=0, in-transit=867, but three consecutive concluded periods show zero arrivals for orders placed in P1-P3 \u2014 suggests missing/delayed shipments but not yet confirmed as lead-time change. I keep L as default (promised 2) because no concluded arrivals have established an alternate lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances using full historical sample set while the large in-transit quantity provides coverage; defaults avoid overreacting to possibly lost shipments and prevent overordering given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (367, 352, 148) have not concluded by Period 4 (three consecutive concluded periods with arrived=0) \u2014 possible lost or substantially delayed shipments; monitor for confirmation.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
464297007: ordered=15, arrived=352 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=352, demand=278, sold=278, ending on-hand inventory=74
Daily Profit: $1112.00, Daily Holding Cost: $74.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1038.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history: Period 4 confirmed arrival of Period 2 order (lead_time=2). Orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconfirmed (possible lost/delayed). Current on-hand=74, in-transit=530 (includes outstanding unconfirmed orders). I will keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because observed lead-time evidence is mixed (one confirmed 2-period arrival, others missing\u2014not yet a sustained change). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 this balances service level using full-sample statistics while the cap limits order size to mitigate risk from potentially lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=809. Historical weekly demand (most recent 5 periods): [159,373,301,278,250] -> recent mean=272.2. Concluded arrival evidence: Period 4 shows order from P2 arrived in 2 periods (P2->P4). However orders from P1 and P3 have still not concluded, suggesting some lost/delayed shipments. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat using recent 5-period mean scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead demand; set sigma_hat using recent 5-period volatility to capture current variability. This balances service (covering 3 periods of recent elevated demand) vs holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4); Orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unarrived by Period 6 and are likely lost or substantially delayed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-6) show elevated weekly demand (159,373,301,278,250,216) vs older Jan samples\u2014use a recent-sample forecast. Pipeline shows 652 in-transit and 63 on-hand; several early orders (P1,P3) never concluded and appear lost/delayed, so be conservative on lead-time inference but let backend compute average observed lead time. Choose L by 'calculate' to reflect mixed observed lead times (1 and 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 demand observations to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent variability, helping the OR engine size base-stock for service while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): on-hand=0, in-transit=833. History shows mixed lead-time evidence (observed arrivals imply lead times of 2 periods for P2->P4 and 1 period for P5->P6) and earlier suspected lost shipments (P1,P3 still unarrived). I use 'calculate' for L so the backend averages observed lead times (captures recent 1 and 2-period observations). For demand I bias toward recent weeks (more reflective of Mar demand levels) using recent_N with N=4 (periods 4\u20137 mean) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility reflect the latest regime and avoid overreacting to older Jan samples. This balances service level (using recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain lead-time behavior.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To let the backend infer actual recent average lead time from concluded arrivals, I select L='calculate'. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (captures observed lead-time variability) vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 avg\u22481.4) with some early orders (P1,P3) still never arrived (likely lost). On-hand=141 + in-transit=534 = 675 units \u2014 ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (historical samples mean \u2248237). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures 1.4 vs promised 2). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (profit>holding cost) while letting OR engine apply its capped ordering given observed lead-time behavior and the pipeline uncertainties. This approach avoids overreacting to possibly lost single shipments while reflecting the shorter average lead time seen in concluded arrivals.

To reflect observed variability while leveraging all demand history, set L by calculate (use average observed lead time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1 and uses full sample stability against noisy arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, In-transit=816. History shows mixed actual lead times (observed concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) and several early-period orders (notably Periods 1 and 3) that never concluded and are likely lost/delayed; however evidence is not a new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded insights. I select L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 period variability). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given mixed lead-time realizations and missing shipments and balances service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime shift; last 5 demands = [169,176,323,122,151] (mean ~188). Pipeline is large (in-transit=658) with on-hand=9; several earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent concludes show actual lead times vary 1\u20132 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current short-term mean (1+L) multiplies that recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock responsive to recent demand while leveraging observed lead-time evidence and the large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weekly demand has been volatile with multiple stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=670. History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2) with several early orders (P1,P3) never concluding\u2014possible lost shipments\u2014but more recent arrivals align with promised 2. To balance service and holding cost I choose a lead-time estimate based on the recent observed lead-time history (captures recent 1/2-day patterns) and leave demand mean/volatility to the backend defaults so they use the full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent lead-time changes while avoiding overfitting short demand noise given limited samples and pending in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, in-transit=795. History shows variable observed lead times (mixture of 1 and 2), recent average \u22481.6 so I use a recent average to reflect current reality and possible partial delays. Demand has shifted recently (large spikes then moderate), so I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime (reduces overreaction to older samples). These choices raise target coverage modestly above promised L while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=658. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1 -> mix around ~1.5). Several early orders remained unarrived for long periods but later concluded shipments confirm lead time oscillates around promised 2. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method: calculate) to capture this variability. For demand I use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples (method: default) to leverage the provided historical demand base; sigma_hat left as default to reflect overall sample volatility. These choices balance service (by using observed lead-time average) against holding cost (default demand and volatility avoid overfitting to recent spikes) while remaining robust to occasional lost/delayed shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.56) so I'll let backend compute an empirical average (calculate) for L. Recent demand (last 5 concluded demands: P14-P18 = 151,171,200,154,281; mean\u2248191) is more reflective of current regime than early-January samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand pattern. This balances service (capture recent higher demand spikes) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows volatile weekly demand with a single very large spike in Period 19 (demand=556) but no sustained (>3 periods) demand regime change. Several past orders were delayed or lost earlier, however many concluded lead times are observed as 1 or 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=658 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders remained missing for long periods. I choose L='calculate' to let the backend use the average of all observed lead times (captures the mixed 1\u20132 period realizations rather than blindly using promised L=2). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I choose 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the full sample set \u2014 conservative given no sustained regime shift and to let the OR engine temper the single recent spike. This balances service level (by using observed lead-time average) against holding cost (by not overreacting to one large demand week).

Historical demand samples mean=236.6/week with std\u224879.1. I set L by calculate (average of observed lead times = 1.5) so the OR engine accounts for the mixed 1\u20132 period reality.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=863. Historical concluded lead-times (observed arrivals) average 1.5 periods (mix of 1 and 2, some lost orders earlier). Recent demand has risen vs. Jan samples (last 5 concluded demands: 154,281,556,261,201 \u2192 mean ~291) indicating a higher current regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to let backend use the empirical average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime; this increases target base-stock to reduce lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level (prevent stockouts given elevated recent demand) against holding cost, relying on observed lead-time behavior rather than the promised value.

No strong evidence to override promised lead time. To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit, use calculated average lead time (to reflect observed 1\u20132 variability) and default demand/volatility scaling so the OR backend uses full sample history for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weeks show very high demand spikes (Periods 19,22,23: 556,341,422) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=658. Historical concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods with confirmation of 2 in earlier windows; no new sustained lead-time change detected. I choose promised/default lead time to keep OR engine calibrated to supplier promise. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (capture recent high demand in historical series) vs. holding cost without overfitting to the volatile recent spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 19-23: 556, 261, 201, 341, 422) versus earlier baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=893 so substantial pipeline exists but prior shipments show mixed lead times (1\u20132) and some lost orders historically. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures empirical 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime starting around Period 19 (regime length ~5 weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time variability and reduces risk of underordering given in-transit uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=981. History shows mixed actual lead times (1 or 2 periods) and some older orders never concluded; risk of lost shipments exists but not yet a sustained new pattern. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative base-stock that balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) and holding cost given pipeline uncertainty.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand (June\u2013Aug) is elevated vs early-year; lead times observed vary (mix of 1 and 2 periods). To adapt, set L to calculate (average of observed lead times) so the backend infers current typical lead time from concluded arrivals. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent demand regime (captures the sustained higher demand in the last ~6 periods) so base-stock responds to increased demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 vs profit $4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=893. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,2) suggesting average lead time \u22481.54 periods; some shipments were lost/delayed earlier but multiple confirms of 1\u20132 period arrivals. To balance service vs holding cost I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time (calculate) and use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with full historical demand and observed lead-time average, ensuring pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods while not overcommitting inventory given holding cost. This also leverages the large in-transit quantity already present.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=893. Historical concluded lead-times (periods with arrived=... lead_time was W): [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,2] => avg \u22481.55. Promised L=2 but observed average is ~1.55; choose calculated L to let backend reconcile promised vs observed. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, maintaining the OR-engine's capped policy and balancing service level (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) without overfitting to short recent spikes. This approach also keeps orders conservative given 893 units already in transit and prior evidence of some lost/delayed shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=893. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (many 1s and 2s); recent history includes several lost/delayed shipments but multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=1 and =2. I choose to let the backend infer an empirical lead time average from observed concludes to capture the mixed reality, and use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) using all historical samples. This balances service (captures elevated demand samples) against holding cost by deferring explicit inflation of forecast or variance despite some overdue shipments.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times of 1\u20132 periods (multiple concluded lines: observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,2], avg\u22481.54) and some early orders never concluded (possible losses). Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend applies its long-run demand estimate; this balances service level given large in-transit stock while not overreacting to transient missing shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=893. Historical concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; some early orders (Periods 1 and 3) remain unarrived suggesting isolated lost/delayed shipments but recent observations show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. To let the backend learn the true average lead time from concluded arrivals, I select L=calculate (average of observed lead times). Demand forecasting will use the backend's default aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat follow defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service vs holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1. This keeps parameters simple while allowing the OR engine to cap orders and adapt to the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=893 \u2014 large pipeline but many past orders showed mixed lead times and some lost shipments earlier (Periods 1&3 likely lost). Recent concluded arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132 periods; no sustained change convincingly shifts actual lead time away from the promised 2. Demand history is limited in the seed samples but variable; to be conservative and let OR backend use full-sample statistics, I select default methods so backend uses promised L and overall-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This preserves service-level targets while avoiding overfitting to recent volatility and avoids compounding uncertainty from possibly-lost orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows prolonged stockouts (on-hand=0 many periods) with a large in-transit balance (893) and intermittent arrivals with observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods and some likely lost shipments earlier. Demand has been volatile with a recent spike (Period 33=692) but not yet a sustained new regime. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (~1.54) to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior rather than blindly trusting the promised 2. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples are used; this balances service level (captures long-run mean) against holding costs while the lead-time average accounts for delivery variability and past missing shipments.

Because there are multiple confirmed arrivals with differing delays, use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history is limited but stable-season sample set available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. This approach lets the OR engine account for effective lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overfitting to recent noisy missing shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods; no sustained shift confirmed since last insights. On-hand=0, in-transit=904 which is a large pipeline balance likely sufficient to cover (1+L) periods of demand; some prior orders were delayed/lost but recent arrivals (e.g. P36) indicate shipments still arriving. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting given mixed evidence. Select default demand/volatility (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full sample statistics; this balances service level vs holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=904. Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (13 observed arrivals, average \u22481.46) and some lost shipments earlier. Promised lead time=2 but observed average is lower; no sustained recent shift to a longer lead time. Given large in-transit stock (904) and high demand variability, use calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior while keeping demand forecasts conservative using defaults. Chosen methods: L by calculate to let backend use observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=904. History shows mixed observed lead times (1\u20132) and multiple missing/unconcluded shipments earlier; no clear, sustained shift in lead time or demand regime in the most recent concluded periods. To avoid overreacting to transient missing arrivals and let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics, use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

To avoid overreacting to noisy recent spikes and because promised lead time is 2, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=904; history shows mixed lead-times (many 1s and 2s) and several lost/very delayed orders earlier. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed lead times (recent observed lead times average \u22481.5) to reflect the 1\u20132 period variability. Demand and volatility are left to defaults so mu_hat/sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this avoids overfitting to recent noisy/lost arrivals while the large in-transit pipeline is present.

History shows intermittent actual lead_times of 1\u20132 and several multi-period missing arrivals (possible lost shipments), but no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time since prior insights. Keep L at promised (default) so backend assumes 2-period lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (full-sample statistics scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) to smooth noise and let the large in-transit pipeline be reconciled by the OR engine. This balances service (using full-history mean) against holding costs given high pipeline volume.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 39-43: 241, 387, 348, 311, 266) indicating a higher-demand regime entering Dec. On-hand=0, in-transit=904 (large pipeline) \u2014 some earlier orders were delayed/lost but several arrivals confirmed lead times of 1\u20132. To reflect confirmed lead-time behavior while letting the OR backend compute a robust L from observations, I set L='calculate'. To capture the recent high-demand regime (holiday season), I forecast demand using the last 5 weeks (recent_N, N=5) for mu_hat and match volatility with recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat. This biases orders toward meeting the current elevated demand while keeping the backend's cap in place to limit overordering against any remaining lost shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=1019. Historical concluded arrivals show a mix of 1- and 2-period lead times (many observed: 1 or 2), with some long-missing orders likely lost earlier. Demand history shows no clear recent regime shift vs. historical samples. To balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample statistics and inferred average lead-time, I choose to let the backend calculate the average observed lead time and use default demand/volatility estimators based on all samples. This keeps ordering conservative given large in-transit volume and uncertain lost shipments while leveraging observed lead-time distribution.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=1019. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with earlier confirmation of 2 periods; use promised/default lead time to keep model aligned with contract and historical average. Demand historical sample mean (provided dataset) is ~236.6; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) yields a (L+1)-period forecast ~710 units which is covered by current in-transit (1019), so no aggressive uplift is needed. Default choices balance high service target (profit/holding implies q=0.8) while avoiding excess holding given large in-transit stock and some evidence of lost/delayed shipments in earlier periods.
