The P1 order (124) remains un-concluded/overdue (still listed in-transit) and appears to be a missing shipment until a conclude message confirms arrival. Step 2 \u2014 Demand & OR numbers: Historical weekly mean = 77.2, std \u224827.9. For L=2: \u03bc\u0302=231.6, \u03c3\u0302\u224848.36.

Step 3 \u2014 Decision logic: Given one shipment (P1=124) is still overdue beyond its expected arrival and could be lost, be cautious but avoid over-ordering: follow the statistical cap (prevents excessive orders under pipeline uncertainty) and assume we need to replenish pipeline if P1 is lost. Therefore order = cap \u2248123 units (rounded to 123). This balances restoring coverage for the (L+1)=3 period demand while respecting the OR cap and holding cost exposure. Step 4 \u2014 Inventory impact: With on-hand 8 plus ordered 123 (arriving in Period 7 due to L=2), we rebuild pipeline to cover upcoming periods even if the 124 in-transit never concludes.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded arrivals show frequent delays and many lost/phantom in-transit units since Period 17; recent pipeline (in-transit=571) is unreliable per carry-over notes, so I treat pipeline as effectively zero for ordering decisions. Step 2 \u2014 Demand estimate (use OR's historical sample set): sample mean \u03bc\u0304=77.2, sample sd \u03c3\u0304\u224827.93. With promised L=2: \u03bc\u0302=(1+L)\u03bc\u0304=231.6, \u03c3\u0302=\u221a(1+L)\u03c3\u0304\u224848.36. Step 3 \u2014 Service target: profit=19, holding=1 \u2192 critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645. Base-stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 231.6 + 1.645\xd748.36 \u2248 311 units. Step 4 \u2014 OR cap: cap = \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xd7\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L) \u2248 77.2 + 45.96 \u2248 123 units. OR recommended 0 (because it counted pipeline), but given pipeline unreliability we should ignore in-transit. Step 5 \u2014 Final decision: order up to the OR cap to rebuild dependable on-hand inventory while limiting exposure to lost shipments and holding cost. I choose 123 units (matches cap) to cover ~1+L periods with high service given high profit/low holding and to replace unreliable pipeline. Monitoring plan: if this conclude shows arrival consistent with promised L, reduce future orders; if it fails to conclude, treat as lost and escalate ordering cadence cautiously.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "OR's 0 reflects counting an unreliable in-transit of 571; treating pipeline as unreliable, I follow the capped policy and order 123 units to rebuild on-hand stock while capping exposure to lost shipments.",
