Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly data (5 samples) show stable demand around mean 44.2 units/week; no arrival history (on-hand=0, in-transit=0) and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Use promised lead time (default L=2) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that covers current period plus lead-time while avoiding assumptions about lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand mean ~44 (samples: 41,41,41,47,51) but Period 1 demand spiked to 158. On-hand=0, in-transit=52 (Period 1 order not yet concluded). No confirmed lead-time change (only one conclude showing arrived=0). To balance responsiveness to the large recent spike while retaining history, keep promised lead time and use an EWMA for demand with moderate smoothing (gamma=0.5). Use default volatility estimate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=233. Two consecutive periods (P1,P2) show zero arrivals for orders placed, so shipments are delayed but not yet a confirmed lead-time change (need \u22653 periods to be sustained). Use promised lead time to avoid overreacting to transient delays. Demand context: recent historical weekly mean \u224844.2 units (samples: 41,41,41,47,51). Choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised, balancing service level against holding cost while we gather one more conclude to confirm a lead-time shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is dramatically higher (158, 392, 359) than the older sample series (~41-51), indicating a sustained regime shift upward for at least 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=522 but no concluded arrivals have been observed (P1\u2013P3 orders show arrived=0), so lead time cannot be confirmed from concluded messages; shipments may be delayed or lost. I therefore keep L at default (promised 2) because there is no concluded evidence to override it. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (the last 3 periods form a consistent, sustained increase). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty; retaining default L avoids incorrectly lengthening lead time without confirmed concluded arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded by Period 4 (arrived=0), suggesting delayed or lost shipments; recent realized demand has shifted up (Periods 1-3 avg=303).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demand is well above historical Jan samples: concluded demands P1-P4 = [158,392,359,263] (recent average \u2248 293 for last 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (orders placed P1-P4 sum 1034, arrived=181 \u2192 853 outstanding), with one concluded lead-time observation: P2 order arrived in P4 => observed lead_time=2 (matches promised). Given matched observed lead time and persistent higher recent demand, keep L as default (promised=2) but base demand forecast on the recent regime. Therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated demand ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 concluded demands) and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service requirement vs holding cost while acknowledging some prior shipments remain in-transit and may be delayed or lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=1112. Historical concluded arrivals show an observed lead time of 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4); several earlier orders delayed/lost but evidence so far supports L=2. Recent realized demand is elevated compared with the distant Jan samples; I use the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 3-5) to capture the current regime for forecast mean and volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding overreaction to a single spike; using a short recent_N window balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost sensitivity.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand history (Periods1-6) shows elevated but variable weekly demand (samples mean ~240.5). Pipeline is large: on-hand=80, in-transit=853 (many units outstanding; some past orders experienced delays). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) \u2014 use recent average to reflect variable/shorter realized lead time. Set L using recent_N (N=2) to average the last 2 observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7overall sample mean and volatility, leveraging full sample history while the L estimate adjusts the review+lead horizon for the large in-transit pipeline. This balances service level (accounting for observed shorter lead times) against holding costs given current high in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-7): [158,392,359,263,192,179,281] with recent volatility and no sustained >3-period shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals give observed lead times: order from P2 arrived in P4 (LT=2), order from P5 arrived in P6 (LT=1) \u2014 use recent_N average of last 2 observed lead times to capture this variability (L recent_N N=2 => avg LT=1.5). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples P3\u2013P7 = [359,263,192,179,281]) to reflect the current regime without older Jan data; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these 5 recent samples so the OR backend targets an (1+L)-period forecast and measured volatility. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to cover spikes) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and variable actual lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the old 2019-Jan samples (recent periods P1-P8 demands: 158,392,359,263,192,179,281,359) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Lead times observed in concluded messages vary (order on P2 arrived in P4 \u2192 LT=2; order on P5 arrived in P6 \u2192 LT=1). To balance service and holding cost I average recent lead-time observations to capture variability (L=recent_N) and use recent demand statistics (last 5 periods) to set forecast and volatility so the OR backend can size base-stock and the capped order appropriately under the volatile recent regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent realized demand (Periods 4-9 = 263,192,179,281,359,215) is well above the early Jan samples, so I use recent demand to set forecast. On-hand=0 and in-transit=871 (large pipeline) but past shipments show variable lead times (observed leads: 2 periods for P2->P4, 1 period for P5->P6). I therefore set L using recent observed lead times (capture variability) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 demand observations to reflect the current higher-demand regime; this balances higher service needs while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula to limit excess ordering despite the large in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent realized weekly demand remains elevated but volatile (last 3 demands = 359,215,173; mean ~249). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P8->P10) \u2014 recent average \u22481.67. To remain responsive to the slightly shortened/variable lead time while using recent demand, I set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 demand samples to capture the latest regime. This keeps target stock sensitive to recent higher demand but caps orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding (holding cost >0 encourages using recent data and relying on large existing pipeline).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent realized demand is elevated and variable (recent demands: P7-11 = 281,359,215,173,160). Pipeline is large (in-transit=890) while on-hand=0; several past orders showed mixed lead times (observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2]). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to let the backend average the three most recent observed lead times, capturing current lead-time variability. For demand I choose recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the last five demand observations (captures the recent higher-demand regime). For sigma_hat I choose recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices balance service (by using recent higher demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent realized demand is well above the early 2019 samples (recent periods 1\u201312 demands: 158,392,359,263,192,179,281,359,215,173,160,111) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=890. Observed concluded lead times: orders arriving in P4 (ordered P2) = 2, P6 (ordered P5) = 1, P10 (ordered P8) = 2 \u2192 recent lead times [2,1,2]. I set L using recent_N N=3 to reflect the short-term observed average lead time (~1.67) rather than blindly trusting the promised 2. For demand I use a recent_N window of N=6 (Periods 7\u201312) to capture the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting very early spikes; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of those 6 recent demands. I use the same recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat so volatility reflects the same recent regime. These choices balance service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and evidence of variable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time estimated from concluded arrivals as avg 1.67 periods (observed lead_times: 2,1,2).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been variable but elevated versus earliest samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P8->P10), 2 (P11->P13)] so I use the observed-average lead time to let the backend adapt to realized transit behavior. Given the large in-transit volume I keep demand estimates simple/default so the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations use the full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes while still reflecting the inferred lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed 2,1,2,2 with three recent 2s: P2->P4, P8->P10, P11->P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Recent concluded demands (P10-P14) = [173,160,111,79,87], recent mean=122. Promised lead time=2 and recent concluded lead times (most recent three are 2) support using promised lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent; sigma_hat uses recent volatility from the same window. This keeps the base-stock tied to current observed demand while the large in-transit pipeline avoids stockouts despite some past missing shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Concluded history shows observed lead_times = {2,1,2,2} with recent pattern dominated by 2s; I use a recent average for L to capture this. Recent demand has moderated versus early spikes; last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 11-15 = 160,111,79,87,106) show mean ~108.6, so I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect current regime. These choices keep pipeline sizing responsive to the confirmed shorter/stable lead-time pattern and recent demand level while avoiding overcommitment given potential past missing shipments. No new sustained changepoint to add to carry-over.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline covering many periods; some prior shipments were delayed but recent concludes show lead_time=2). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (2) consistent with concluded evidence. Recent demand has settled lower (~last 5 periods mean \u2248 90), so I set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime. Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine retains full historical variance information; given the large pipeline this avoids overreacting to small recent swings.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 large pipeline present so focus on realistic lead-time and recent demand regime. Lead-time evidence (concluded arrivals): observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P8->P10), 2 (P11->P13)]; the most recent three = [1,2,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.67, so I use a recent average to reflect small variability but bias to the recent 2s. Demand has slowed compared with earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands = [79,87,106,71,46] \u2192 recent mean ~77.8, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the current lower demand while recognizing lead-time is effectively ~1.7 periods (so (1+L) coverage accounted for).

Set L to promised (2) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap to the current lower-demand regime and the confirmed LT, reducing excess holding while preserving service against recent variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=853. Historical concluded lead times show recent confirmation of 2-period actual lead time; promised lead time=2 so I use default L. Recent demand has been low/stable in the last several weeks (Periods 15-20: 106,71,46,43,74,59) so I base demand forecast and volatility on that recent regime to avoid over-ordering against earlier high spikes. Choose recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent 6 periods (Periods 15-20). This keeps (1+L)*mean aligned to current demand and reduces holding cost while pipeline (853 units) appears large relative to recent demand, so conservative recent-based estimates help the backend cap orders and avoid excess holding.

Recent demand (Periods 17-21 = 46,43,74,59,70) avg=58.4; I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture current lower post-peak regime. Choices: L -> calculate (use observed lead times average) to let backend infer ~1.75; mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)*mean on the latest stable demand regime; sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show stable lead times centered on 2 periods (recent confirmed 2s); I therefore keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (captures current mean and volatility). This reduces ordering compared with using all historical high-demand samples while the large in-transit volume prevents aggressive new orders; choice balances high service target (profit/holding leads to high q) against holding costs by basing forecasts on recent lower demand and letting the OR cap limit order size given existing pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand and likely covers many weeks of demand. Historical concluded lead times are dominated by 2-period arrivals (evidence in Periods 4,10,13) and prior carry-over already confirmed LT=2; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change in the last 3+ periods. To avoid overreacting to short-term low demand and because pipeline is ample, use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility calculations (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples). This keeps ordering conservative given large in-transit inventory and balances service level vs. holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 large pipeline present from prior orders. Recent realized weekly demand has declined through summer (Periods 16-25: 71,46,43,74,59,70,53,26,15,22 \u2014 much lower than earlier spikes). Historical concluded lead times recently cluster at 2 periods; promised lead time=2. To avoid overstocking given the large in-transit position and the clear recent low-demand summer regime, I use L=default (trust promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the low recent regime (Periods 16-25 average is the best short-term forecast) and reduce ordering aggressiveness. For sigma I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect lower recent variability. These choices lower the base_stock and cap relative to long-run averages, helping the OR backend avoid excess holding cost while still covering near-term demand and the 2-period lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent realized demand has been low compared with early-year spikes; last 6 concluded weekly demands = [70,53,26,15,22,30] (avg ~36). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but some earlier shipments were delayed; promised lead time remains 2. I set L=default to keep backend using promised lead time (supported by prior confirmations of 2). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility focus on the most recent low-demand regime and avoid being pulled by early high winter samples. This balances service (use pipeline) against holding cost by lowering target stock to match recent demand.

Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=853. Recent concluded history (up to Period 14) confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods. No new sustained demand regime change since prior insights. I select L='default' (use promised lead time=2) to align with confirmed lead-time and OR backend assumptions. I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all historical samples for the base-stock calculation; this is conservative given no clear new sustained demand regime and large in-transit stock already present.

Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior analysis; I use the promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime and lower volatility so orders won't overshoot given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Recent realized demand has fallen and stabilized in the last several weeks (Periods 25-29 demands = 22,30,33,20,29). Promised lead time remains 2 periods and recent concluded lead-time history supports that; no new sustained lead-time change observed. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility: mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the last 5 demand samples (Periods 25-29). L set to default (promised) so the OR backend uses the contractual 2-period lead time; with large in-transit inventory this avoids over-ordering while recent_N demand estimates keep base-stock modest to reduce holding cost but retain service for near-term demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=853. Recent concluded history shows lead time confirmed at 2 periods (multiple observations); I therefore use the promised/default lead time. Recent demand (most recent periods) is substantially lower than early-year peaks and appears to have settled around ~30 units/week; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std) so the OR backend targets service for the current lower-demand regime while accounting for two-period lead time and the large pipeline.

Recent realized demand has been low and stable over the last 9 weeks (Periods 24-32 avg \u224827 units). To avoid overstocking given high pipeline, keep promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current low-demand regime. Chosen: L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to set base stock to (1+L)*recent mean, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock tight against current low variability.

Recent realized demand has been low and stable since ~Period 11 (many weeks of single- to double-digit demand), a sustained lower-demand regime; use recent data to avoid overforecasting from early high spikes. Promised lead time is 2 (confirmed historically), so keep L = default (promised). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent low-demand regime (N capped at 20 and reflects the ~23-period low-demand run). This keeps the OR backend responsive to current low demand while the large in-transit volume will limit further ordering via the cap, reducing holding cost risk.

No new sustained demand regime change in the last 3+ periods (recent weekly demands mostly low 15\u201365 range). To let the OR engine combine full historical demand statistics with the promised lead time and large pipeline, I choose default (promised) lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This avoids overreacting to transient zeros and leverages the existing large in-transit position to prevent excessive new orders while maintaining service-level balance given profit/holding costs.

Promised lead time=2 (previous conclude messages consistently show 2); I keep L=default to let backend assume promised lead time. To align ordering with recent demand regime and avoid extra overstock given the large in-transit, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current lower post-season demand). Using recent_N (N=5) for both demand mean and volatility gives the OR engine a short-window forecast (1+L periods) and tighter uncertainty estimates so the capped order policy will avoid ordering on top of the 853 units already in transit.

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 large pipeline covers many periods so avoid increasing forecast aggressiveness. Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 (observed 2,1,2,2); promised lead time is 2. Use default lead time to keep model aligned with contract and OR engine assumptions. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative given large in-transit and recent low weekly demand. This minimizes new orders while letting the OR engine cap/order against the existing pipeline.

No new sustained demand regime change in the most recent 8+ periods (weekly demands ~24\u201382) so use defaults to let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample statistics; this keeps model aligned with promised L and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while accounting for pipeline of 853 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent realized weekly demand has been volatile with some large spikes (Periods 37-38: 82,165) but long-run historical samples (early 2019) remain the primary forecast anchor. On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline). Past concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time \u2248 promised 2 periods; no new sustained changepoint detected. To avoid overreacting to recent spikes while the pipeline is large (853), use default lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR backend will compute base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance and naturally cap orders versus pipeline. This balances service level (using full-sample uncertainty) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and risk of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 which likely covers upcoming demand but arrivals are observed with 1-period delay. Historical concluded lead-times support L=2; recent demand has increased (last 5 weeks: 38,24,82,165,112) so I bias forecasts toward a recent-window estimate. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed 2; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher mean and volatility and so the OR engine sizes orders for the (1+L)-period demand and elevated variability while avoiding excessive hold cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times {2,1,2,2} so use calculated average lead time. Given large in-transit stock I keep demand forecast method as default so the OR backend's (1+L)*mean(all samples) will temper new orders; volatility also default. This avoids over-ordering while the pipeline clears and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=853. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 periods (multiple observations P2->P4, P8->P10, P11->P13). Recent demand has shifted higher in late Oct\u2013Nov (Periods 37-41: 82,165,112,127,115; recent mean \u2248120), so I target the (L+1)-period forecast using the last 5 weeks to capture the current regime. Set L explicitly to 2 to match confirmed actual lead time and ensure the pipeline covers 3 periods of demand; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 samples, balancing higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 \u2014 large pipeline present. Recent demand has jumped (most recent 5 concluded demands: P38-42 = 165,112,127,115,295) so I use a short recent-N demand estimate to capture the elevated mean and volatility. Lead time has previously been confirmed at 2 and promised LT=2, so use default. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent higher-demand regime and its variability; this balances service (higher target stock) against holding cost given the sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline but many prior periods showed arrived=0 \u2192 missing/delayed shipments history). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 38 (Oct 28) with several high weeks (Periods 38-43: 165,112,127,115,295,60) indicating a recent regime with higher mean and volatility. Given continued evidence of concluded lead-times centered on 2 periods and the promised lead time=2, I keep L at default (promised) to align OR backend with contract lead time while using recent demand to adapt forecasts. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (uses the last 6 demand observations) so the base-stock and cap reflect current elevated demand and higher variability; this helps balance service (avoid stockouts during holiday spike) against holding cost, while relying on the large in-transit volume to cover near-term needs if/when it concludes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weeks (Periods 37-44) show substantially higher and more variable demand (several >100 and one 295) consistent with holiday season uplift versus earlier low-demand months. On-hand=0, in-transit=853 (large pipeline that may cover upcoming demand but arrivals have not been observable recently). No new conclusive lead-time changepoint in concluded history since Period 14, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent elevated demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using the last 12 periods to reflect the Nov\u2013Dec uplift while retaining enough samples to smooth noise. This raises base_stock to improve service during the peak while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability so the backend sets an appropriate safety stock.

LLM Rationale:

Given the large in-transit pipeline and confirmed LT=2, I use the default lead time (promised=2) so the OR engine's internal LT assumption aligns with contract. I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (use all historical samples) to avoid overfitting to recent noisy spikes; the large pipeline will primarily determine near-term availability while the defaults let the backend compute base_stock and cap using full-sample statistics.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand shows a large Black-Friday spike (Period 42=295) but typical weekly demand since Nov is ~50\u2013165. On-hand=0, in-transit=853 units \u2014 pipeline is already large relative to expected demand so no aggressive up-weighting of forecast or safety stock is needed. Historical concluded lead-times support the promised L=2 (no new sustained lead-time evidence). I therefore use default methods so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and std; this avoids placing additional orders while the large in-transit position arrives.
