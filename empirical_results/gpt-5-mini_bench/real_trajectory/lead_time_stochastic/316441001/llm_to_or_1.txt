Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 316441001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean ~ (102,89,87,148,148). No sustained changepoint or late shipments observed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample estimates and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent observed weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~114.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (order placed P1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival may occur later); do not assume loss yet. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given limited evidence of a regime shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) mean ~114.8; recent realized demand P1=82, P2=138, no sustained shift detected. Promised lead time = 2 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 would only conclude later), so no confirmed lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 vs (1+L)*mean \u2248 344.4 => pipeline slightly below the (L+1)-period expected demand but shortfall is small and not yet supported by evidence of lost shipments. Use default statistics so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time to balance service level and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods (P1-P3) show no arrivals for orders placed, but no concluded arrival messages exist to confirm a lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=385 which already exceeds a 3-period demand forecast based on historical mean (~114.8/week). To avoid overreacting to delayed but unconfirmed arrivals, use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand statistics so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (pipeline already large enough to cover (1+L) periods) against holding cost while preserving sensitivity to future conclude messages that would confirm lead-time changes.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed across 3 concluded periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 showed arrived=0 (ordered amounts: P1=166, P2=160, P3=59) \u2014 suggests delayed or lost shipments; monitor for further conclude evidence before declaring lead-time change.

Daily Profit: $240.00, Daily Holding Cost: $100.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows one order (P2) arrived with lead_time=2, while orders from P1 and P3 remain in-transit (225 units) and may be delayed/lost. On-hand=100 + in-transit=225; expected pipeline matches P1(166)+P3(59). No sustained demand regime change in the provided samples (historic weekly demands: 102,89,87,148,148). I retain promised lead time and use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, allowing the engine to balance service level vs holding cost while we monitor missing arrivals for a confirmed lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand (Periods 1-5): [82,138,106,60,63] \u2014 demand dipped in Periods 4-5 versus earlier weeks. On-hand=37, in-transit=266; observed concluded lead time evidence = 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Some earlier missing arrivals occurred but recent conclude confirms L=2. I choose L by observed average ('calculate') to reflect confirmed lead time=2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the recent lower-demand regime while still accounting for earlier higher weeks. Sigma also uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend to a base-stock sized to recent demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and protecting against stockouts given the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=14, in-transit=239. History shows mixed evidence: multiple missing arrivals early (P1,P3) but confirmed lead_time=2 from P2->P4 and a short arrival P5->P6 (lead_time=1). Signal not yet consistently shifted (insufficient sustained evidence). I use the promised lead time (default) and historical demand samples to let the OR engine compute base_stock from the pooled mean/variance; this is conservative given on-hand+pipline are large but avoids overfitting to the recent noisy arrivals or presumed losses.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed lead times = 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6); several earlier orders were missing/delayed (P1,P3 showed arrived=0). Recent demand has clearly shifted down since Period 4: Periods 4-7 demand = [60,63,64,60]. To reflect the shorter recent lead-time evidence while remaining robust to variance, I set L to recent_N (N=2) to average the two observed lead times (1 and 2). For demand, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 4-7) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of those 4 recent periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to estimate volatility from the same regime. This approach (short recent L, recent demand/volatility) reduces over-ordering from older high-demand data while keeping protection against remaining in-transit uncertainty and prior missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand since P4 = 61.75 (Periods 4-7 = 60,63,64,60), down from ~106 (earlier samples) \u2248 -42%; sustained 4 periods of lower demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been in the lowered regime since Period 4 (avg \u224861.75 over P4\u2013P7). Lead times have been variable (observed W = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 recent avg 1.5) and some earlier orders were delayed/missing but recent concludes show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. On-hand=45, in-transit=225 \u2192 pipeline=270 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand for L\u22481.5. To reflect the sustained lower demand regime I set demand estimates using the recent 4-period regime (N=4). To capture the observed short/variable lead times I use the recent 4 observed lead-time samples. Volatility is estimated from the same recent 4 demand samples so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately while avoiding excess holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=225; past concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2). I set L using observed average lead time to capture the 1\u20132 period variability. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed lower-demand regime (Periods 4\u20139, 6 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower mean and its volatility, keeping inventories lean vs holding cost while covering lead+review periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime identified at Period 4 (post-P4 weekly demands: 60,63,64,60,61,50,34). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (pipeline large from prior orders). Lead-time observations from concluded messages: last 4 observed lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). I choose L recent_N to let backend smooth lead-time at short horizon; for demand I use a recent_N window covering the confirmed lower-demand regime (7 most recent post-shift samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower mean and recent volatility. These parameters reduce risk of overstock given large pipeline and higher holding cost relative to profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weeks show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (avg ~61.75) vs earlier ~106. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (includes previously missing/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods); therefore I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I focus on the confirmed lower-demand regime (Periods 4\u20137) so I use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new mean and volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering vs using the full-sample mean while still accounting for pipeline inventory and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concluded lead-times are mixed (observed 2,1,2,1 \u2192 average 1.5) and there have been earlier missing arrivals; demand dropped starting Period 4 (sustained lower regime). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 4\u201312) because a changepoint at Period 4 produced a sustained lower-demand regime; mu_hat will therefore reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of these 9 most recent samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices reduce target inventory relative to the historical-all mean while allowing the OR engine to respect observed shorter/variable lead times and avoid excess holding costs given the lower demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (periods 4-13 demands = 60,63,64,60,61,50,34,41,34,43; mean ~51.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (pipeline large but mixed arrival history; some late/missing shipments observed earlier). Lead-time observations from concluded periods: observed lead times = [2 (P2->P4),1 (P5->P6),2 (P6->P8),1 (P7->P8)] \u2192 average ~1.5. I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (the post-changepoint regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples, capturing the sustained lower-demand regime and avoiding overstating orders given holding cost. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent variability. These settings balance service (covering review+lead demand under observed lead time) against holding cost given the drop in demand and sizable pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); using calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical lead-time from observed concludes. For demand forecast and volatility I use the recent post-changepoint samples (10 most recent since the confirmed regime shift at P4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $4.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4 (~61.8 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (so pipeline substantial). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 use averaged lead time to reflect mixed evidence. Set L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=12 (regime since P4 length \u224812 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the last 12 demand samples, capturing the lower demand regime and avoiding bias from earlier high-demand periods. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=12 to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service with pipeline acknowledged while reducing forecast bias from older high-demand samples and adapting to observed lead-time variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (avg ~61.75) versus earlier ~106. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (pipeline substantial but recent concluded periods show intermittent arrivals and some lost/delayed shipments historically). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed concluded lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) rather than the promised value, because concluded history shows variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime since Period 4 has 12 samples) so mu_hat reflects the lower-post-change mean across the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture current regime volatility. These choices prioritize matching the recent lower demand regime while letting the backend infer an appropriate lead time from observed conclusions, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. History shows confirmed lead times observed = {2,1,2,1} (avg=1.5) and a sustained demand drop starting Period 4: recent demands P4-P17 = [60,63,64,60,50,34,41,34,43,47,63,40,23] (n=13) vs earlier mean ~106. Several periods (P9-P17) had zero arrivals despite in-transit showing 225 \u2014 suggests shipments delayed but not fully lost. To reflect confirmed mixed lead-time observations, set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand, use recent_N over the 13-period low-demand regime so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower, sustained demand (N=13). This reduces target base-stock and holding costs while preserving service given lower demand and uncertain arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (avg \u224862) and many concluded periods with zero arrivals after Period 7, though some mixed lead-time observations exist (1 and 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (undelivered). To respect observed mixed lead times while weighting most recent observations, I set L using recent_N over the last 4 observed lead-time samples (captures 2,1,2,1). For demand I use recent_N over the last 15 demand samples (Periods 4\u201318) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices push the OR backend to size base stock for the lower demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and current in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 with an extended stretch of very low/zero on-hand sales from P9\u2013P19; on-hand=0, in-transit=225. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, P8:1} \u2192 average \u22481.5, so use calculated average lead time. Use recent demand for forecasting: the most recent sustained low-demand regime spans P9\u2013P19 (11 samples), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the current lower mean and volatility. These choices (calculate L; recent_N for mu/sigma) keep the OR backend responsive to the confirmed shorter/variable lead times and the persistent lower demand while accounting for pipeline inventory to avoid overstocking given holding cost > 0.

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (some past shipments were delayed/lost but concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20132). I set L using calculate to let the backend average observed concluded lead times (captures mixture of 1 and 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 4\u201320) to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the sustained lower-demand regime; this keeps target base stock aligned with current demand and avoids overstock given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (many weeks of single-digit-to-60s demand) and large in-transit balance (225) with earlier signs of delayed arrivals. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the demand forecast and volatility reflect the post-change regime and avoid overordering while in-transit stock is large.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained lower weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (pipeline exists but past arrivals were inconsistent; several earlier shipments delayed/lost but recent conclues show mixed lead times). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the mixed 1\u20132 period observations). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (regime since P4 \u2192 use the last 19 demand samples) so mu_hat reflects the lower sustained demand and avoids overweighting the initial high-Jan samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=19 to capture current volatility under the lower-demand regime. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service given observed lower demand and inconsistent arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (avg since P4 \u2248 61.75) and recent weeks continue at similarly low levels (single-digit-to-20s). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4),1 (P5\u2192P6),2 (P6\u2192P8),1 (P7\u2192P8)} \u2192 average ~1.5. Because lead times have alternated between 1 and 2, I use the calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for observed variability. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4 onward) to reflect the sustained lower demand; N=20 (regime length capped) gives the backend a representative mean across the low-demand period. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep orders conservative given a large in-transit quantity, avoid overstating demand, and align service/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1 implies moderate service target handled by OR engine).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concludes show mixed lead-times (observed: 2,1,2,1) and several earlier missing arrivals; demand dropped sharply at Period 4 and has remained lower since (sustained). To respect observed lead-time variability while letting the backend compute a stable estimate, set L method to calculate (average of observed lead times). Use recent data reflecting the post-P4 low-demand regime for demand forecast and volatility: select recent_N with N=20 (regime from P4 onward, capped at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine plans to cover (1+L) periods using the lower recent mean and corresponding std. This reduces overstock risk given low ongoing demand and accounts for the in-transit units and potential delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Observed concluded lead times from history = {2,1,2,1} -> average ~1.5, so use backend-calculated average to let OR reconcile intermittent 1 vs 2-period arrivals. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 with many recent weekly samples (Periods 9\u201325) showing subdued demand; I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current lower-demand regime and its volatility. These settings keep base-stock aligned to the recent lower mean while letting the backend\u2019s lead-time handling smooth between 1\u20132 period arrivals; that balances service level against the $1 holding cost given $4 profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 4 (avg since P4 ~61.8) and many periods with zero arrivals after P8 (possible lost/delayed shipments). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (possible overdue). I will keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals still show mixed observed lead times and no new conclusive shift in actual lead time; using default prevents overcorrecting for possible lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-P4 lower-demand regime (regime length >20 so cap at 20) so mu_hat reflects current lower mean over the last 20 concluded demand samples. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago high-variance samples. These choices balance service-level (avoid overstock vs. lowered demand) while acknowledging possible missing arrivals by not shortening/lengthening L prematurely.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been well below early-year levels (many zero-stock periods since P9; earlier confirmed downshift around P4, and more persistent low weekly demand through P27). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 \u2014 outstanding pipeline exists but many prior periods show no arrivals, so lost/delayed shipments are possible; be conservative. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (mixed 1\u20132 periods) rather than promised. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (last 19 demand samples from the most recent low-demand regime) to capture the sustained lower demand pattern when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N, N=19 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility rather than early high-variance samples. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holdings given $1 holding cost and $4 profit, while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (historical avg since P4 ~62, earlier avg ~106). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 \u2014 large pipeline but many prior shipments showed delays/missing arrivals; monitor concluded arrivals for lead-time confirmation. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the most recent 20 weekly demands (captures the sustained lower-demand regime). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock relative to earlier high-demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders using observed variability and the computed lead time, avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 \u2014 pipeline large relative to current low demand but some earlier orders were delayed; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but no sustained shift away from promised L=2. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) to let OR engine assume contractual lead time while using a recent-demand estimate. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower-regime mean over the most recent 20 samples (reduces forecast to current demand level and limits over-ordering). For sigma I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce holding cost risk while allowing the OR engine to size orders against the current lower-demand regime and the promised lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concl: lead time has been observed as 2 in prior concl messages and there were earlier missing arrivals but no new sustained lead-time evidence since. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 30). I set L to default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence confirms 2-period arrivals previously and no new confirmed shift beyond lost shipments. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward the lower, recent demand level while keeping promised lead time for the OR engine, balancing service vs. holding cost given limited on-hand and substantial pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concludes show some lost/delayed shipments early (Periods 1-3) and mixed observed lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1). Demand has fallen materially since early periods; recent weeks show low demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (capture recent mean over last N samples). Sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect reduced recent variability. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the lower-demand regime while letting the lead-time estimate use actual observed lead-time data; with 225 units in-transit this avoids overordering into holding costs.

Historical concluded lead times observed = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) with earlier missing arrivals; demand regime dropped at Period 4 and has stayed lower since. To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time mix (1.5 avg) rather than promised blindly; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to use the most recent low-demand regime (longer window up to cap=20) so forecasts reflect sustained lower demand while capturing recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (pipeline available in future periods) \u2014 some earlier shipments were delayed or missing but later concludes show mixed lead times (1\u20132). I choose L by 'calculate' to let the backend infer average observed lead time from concluded messages (captures observed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L) forecast and std on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (P4 onward), balancing service level against holding cost given modest profit/holding (profit $4, holding $1). This keeps orders conservative to avoid excess holding while covering expected (L+1) periods of lower demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4: order P2 arrived P4), 1 (P6: order P5 arrived P6), 2 and 1 (P8: orders P6/P7). Recent observed lead times average ~1.5; I use recent_N over the last 4 observed lead times to capture this variability. Demand has a sustained lower regime after Period 4 but very recent spikes (P33-34) are only 2 periods\u2014insufficient to declare a new regime. Therefore use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (these incorporate the full history while letting L adjust the review+lead period). This balances service level (by adapting L to recent observed lead-time variability) against holding cost by not overreacting to a short recent spike. In-transit (225) already provides coverage; using default demand estimates prevents unnecessary extra ordering given uncertain lead-time/loss signals.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a clear demand uptick in the last 3 concluded periods (P33-35: 98,93,75) after a long low-demand run. Pipeline = 225, on-hand = 0. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (from P4, P6, P8 entries). I set L to recent_N (N=4) to capture the mixed 1\u20132 period evidence (avg 1.5). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (P33-35); sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock and safety stock to cover the confirmed 3-period spike while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-committing if lead times remain mixed. Pipeline (225) approximately matches the (1+L)-period demand under the new short sample mean, but raising mu_hat/sigma_hat will prompt orders to rebuild available stock to meet the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg increased from 31.7 (Periods 4\u201332) to 88.7 (Periods 33\u201335) (+179%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand jumped starting Period 33 (98,93,75,77); recent 4-week average \u224885.8/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=284 which covers ~3*(85.8)=257 demand for (1+L) periods if L=2. Earlier missing-arrival issues observed but lead time was later confirmed as 2; no new multi-period shipping failures since. Set L to default (promised=2) to let backend assume standard lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime while avoiding stale low-demand history; this keeps pipeline sizing conservative but avoids overstock given holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1}) and earlier missing arrivals\u2014so do not trust promised lead time blindly. Demand has a recent regime shift up starting Period 33 (P33\u2013P37 demand = 98,93,75,77,79). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (covers P33\u2013P37). For lead time I request the backend calculate average from observed lead times so ordering reflects empirical delivery performance and helps the OR engine account for delayed/lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 in earlier periods and several delayed arrivals but recent arrivals consistent with promised L=2; no new multi-period shipment loss signal. Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 33 (Periods 33-38 demands = 98,93,75,77,79,90; recent mean \u2248 87) \u2014 use recent data to forecast. Therefore: set L to default (promised 2) to align with confirmed pattern; set mu_hat using recent_N over the new high-demand regime (N=6, Periods 33-38) so (1+L)*mean reflects current demand level; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture the higher recent mean) against holding cost by limiting influence of older low-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed lead times sequence: 2,1,2,1,3) so I estimate lead time using a short recent window to capture recent drift. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 33 (recent demands: P33\u2013P39 = 98,93,75,77,79,90,68); I use recent_N over that regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent higher demand while keeping L responsive to recent lead-time fluctuations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=265. Concluded lead-time evidence is mixed: observed lead_times = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8), 3 (P36->P39)} \u2014 variable but recent demand has shifted up since Period 33. I choose L="calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (captures variability). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-P33 higher-demand regime (Periods 33\u201340) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the backend's lead-time average smooth the mixed lead-time observations. No single lead-time change is yet sustained enough to record as a new carry-over insight.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 33 (P33\u2013P41 showing sustained higher weekly sales vs earlier low-demand periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=265 \u2014 with promised lead time (2) that pipeline + on-hand covers ~3 weeks of demand, so no emergency refill. Observed concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133) but evidence is not yet a sustained shift away from the promised 2-period lead time, so I keep L at default (promised). For demand I use a recent_N forecast to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 9 periods since the regime from P33 has length 9); sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These settings prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check given available pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed last 5: 2,1,2,1,3) and a strong recent demand uptick since Period 33 with very high weeks including Period 42 demand=182. To balance service vs holding cost I use a short, recent lead-time estimate (recent_N=5) to capture recent variability; forecast demand using the most recent 7 weeks to reflect the post-changepoint higher demand; and compute volatility from the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent variability.

Recent concluded lead times: [2,1,2,1,3,3] (last 3 obs = 1,3,3) indicating a recent upward drift \u2014 use recent_N (N=3) to capture current effective lead-time. Demand regime shifted up at Period 33 (already recorded); recent demand (Periods 33\u201343) is higher and volatile, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the full recent regime (N=11 samples, Periods 33\u201343) to reflect current mean and volatility. These settings let the OR backend raise base-stock for higher recent demand while using a short recent lead-time window to react to observed lead-time drift and mitigate risk from missing/delayed shipments.

Observed lead times from concluded messages = {2,1,2,1,3,3} \u2192 average = 2, matching promised lead time; recent demand regime since Period 33 is higher and volatile (several weeks of 70\u2013182). To protect service during the current high-demand regime and given substantial in-transit stock, set L by calculating observed lead time (captures actual behavior). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent high-demand regime (N=12 weeks since the changepoint at P33) so the forecast and volatility reflect the elevated demand and variability; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to recent mean while recognizing holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Context: on-hand=15, in-transit=240; recent calendar: late December (holiday season) with elevated demand (Period 42 demand=182, Periods 33\u201338 show sustained higher demand). Lead-time history (from concluded messages) shows observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,3,3,2] (avg = 2.0) with occasional delayed arrivals and some lost/delayed earlier shipments. Demand regime has materially increased since Period 33 and the recent regime (P33\u2013P45) length = 13 periods. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect observed variability but center on 2. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (N=13) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated demand including holiday uplift. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=13) to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to observed recent variability and observed lead-time average, avoiding understocking during the holiday spike while not overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand regime is the elevated regime starting Period 33 (avg \u224889 since P33); latest 14 weeks (P33\u2013P46) show consistently higher demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=282 \u2014 pipeline sizable but some earlier shipments showed delays; recent concluded lead times include 3,3,2 so I bias toward a slightly longer recent average. Choices: L set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time behaviour (uses last 3 observed lead times which are 3,3,2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=14 to align the forecast and variability with the current high-demand regime (covers P33\u2013P46). These parameters make the OR backend target higher base-stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering if arrivals are slower.
