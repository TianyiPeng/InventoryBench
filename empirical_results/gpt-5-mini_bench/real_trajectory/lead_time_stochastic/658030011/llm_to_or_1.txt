Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No arrivals/concludes observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (through 2019-02-04) show typical demand; no sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, ensuring order targets coverage for current+L future periods given zero inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Historical weekly demand samples (83,67,107,53,116) give mean\u224885.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=129 (ordered in P1) but no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrivals expected in a future conclude). No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence (need \u22653 concluded periods of shift). To avoid over-reacting to the single non-arrival and because promised lead time remains plausible, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=275 (ordered P1=129, P2=146). Promised lead time=2; orders placed in P1 should arrive during this period (P3) and will be visible in Period 4 conclude\u2014no concluded arrivals observed yet, so no evidence to change lead-time. Demand history (samples provided) covers Jan\u2013Feb; no sustained changepoint detected. I therefore keep L as default (use promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs. holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and current large pipeline (275 units) which already provides coverage for upcoming periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 from prior orders (ordered P1-P3) but no arrivals have concluded yet; cannot confirm lead-time change. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) = 136,103,96 which is substantially above historical Jan samples (mean\u224885). To respond to the higher recent demand while remaining conservative on lead time, I keep L as promised (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 3 periods to capture the upward regime. mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty while avoiding explicit lead-time extension until arrivals are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean \u224885.2 units. Promised lead time=2; concluded history shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), so no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Current inventory: on-hand=62, in-transit=189 (healthy pipeline). Use default lead time to trust promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost without overreacting to limited data or transient noise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Concluded history shows an actual arrival: Period4 arrival = 146 units (ordered P2, lead_time=2) so lead time matches promised 2. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: 96,84,88) averages ~89; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture this recent regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed by arrival). Set mu_hat recent_N N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean (captures current ~90/week level over the review+lead horizon). Set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand variability rather than older Jan samples. These parameters prioritize meeting near-term demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived on Period 4: lead_time=2)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand has settled around mid-80s (Periods 4-6 = 84,88,84) after higher earlier demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 \u2014 ample pipeline but recent arrivals show variable lead times (observed 2 and 1). I set L to the average of observed lead times to reflect recent variability. I set mu_hat using the most recent 3 demand observations (captures the new, lower demand regime) scaled by (1+L). I set sigma_hat using the std of the same recent 3 samples to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and available pipeline to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent history shows on-hand=0, in-transit=256, and intermittent arrivals (some orders arrived with 1 or 2 period lag). Given the environment's promised lead time=2 and prior confirmed arrival at 2, I retain the promised lead time to avoid under-ordering. Demand historical samples (83,67,107,53,116) yield mean\u224885.2; using default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast aligned with long-run demand while accounting for the review+lead window. Use default sigma to let the backend compute variability from all samples. This choice balances service (avoid stockouts with L=default and full-sample mu) and holding cost by not inflating demand estimates from the single large recent demand spike (160) which may be an outlier.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand history (5 samples) mean=85.2/week with high variance; current on-hand=0, in-transit=228 units (pipeline large). Concluded lead-time observations = {Period4:2, Period6:1, Period8:2, Period8:1} \u2192 average observed lead time = 1.5. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period realizations). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all historical demand while scaling for the inferred lead time and balances service vs holding given profit=holding. No aggressive upweighting since pipeline already large and recent arrivals are inconsistent.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows variable arrival timings but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over already recorded lead_time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=294 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to historical mean demand (historical weekly mean=85.2; (1+L)=3 \u2192 demand across review+lead \u2248255.6). I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and the OR backend expects promised L; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default to let backend use full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) given limited samples and no confirmed sustained demand regime shift. This keeps ordering conservative given high in-transit stock and balances service vs holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand shows elevated variability with a spike (Period 7=160) and weaker recent weeks (P10=51). On-hand=54, in-transit=189 (pipeline ample vs (1+L) demand). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I detect a recent regime shift/volatility so I use recent_N (N=5) to focus forecast on the last five weeks (Periods 6\u201310) which captures the spike and recent decline. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base stock responsive to recent demand while the pipeline (189 units) reduces urgency to over-order and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=1, in-transit=231. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period observations but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2. Pipeline (231) already large relative to demand samples (historical weekly mean ~85.2). I therefore keep L at the promised/default to remain consistent with confirmed lead-time evidence and because the large in-transit stock already covers multiple periods. Demand estimates use the default aggregate (1+L)\xd7mean and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base stock and the capped order; this avoids overreacting to noisy 1-period arrivals and leverages the provided historical sample set.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] (six observations, avg=1.5). Promised lead time=2 but recent history alternates 1\u20132, so I use recent_N for L to capture the recent empirical mean. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*overall mean and sqrt(1+L)*overall std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and current large pipeline (273 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods but no sustained shift beyond previously recorded confirmation (lead time=2 at Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=232 \u2014 ample pipeline to cover upcoming periods. Historical demand samples (83,67,107,53,116) give mean\u224885.2. Given no strong, sustained demand regime change and the promised lead time=2, use default methods so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from the full-sample statistics and the promised L. This balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit) vs holding cost by letting backend apply its calibrated z* and cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=229. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period leads but multiple confirmations of 2; I choose to let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded messages (calculate). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping a conservative, stable estimate given limited sample set and mixed lead-time evidence. This balances service (accounting for observed multi-period lead times) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent demand centers ~70\u201375 units/week (last 5 demands mean=72). On-hand=0, in-transit=268 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 but majority 2; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (last 5 periods) so base_stock reflects recent higher weekly demand while sigma captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding costs.

Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history. Demand exhibits no clear sustained regime shift; use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent weeks (captures current demand level ~50\u2013100 when stocked) while avoiding overreacting to single stockouts. These settings balance service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded history shows mostly 2-period arrivals with occasional 1-periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=229 (large pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the mix of 1s and 2s). For demand forecast and uncertainty I use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost given modest profit=holding and the substantial in-transit stock. Defaults keep forecasts stable while calculated L lets the engine adapt to the observed lead-time mix.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 units. Recent concluded history shows actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with prior confirmation of 2-period lead for earlier orders. Pipeline (258) is sizable relative to recent weekly demand (~50\u201390). Profit=Holding so critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 base_stock = mu_hat. Use default lead time (promised 2) and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample history; this avoids overfitting to recent variability while the pipeline already provides coverage.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has settled below early-year peaks: last 5 concluded demands = [74,65,53,55,38], mean=57. On-hand=0, in-transit=229 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 periods; recent concludes show mix of 1\u20132 but Period 6 confirmed LT=2 previously. Given large pipeline and recent lower demand, keep promised lead time and use recent-N demand estimates (N=5) to reflect current regime. This reduces over-ordering while preserving service. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=229. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with an average near 1.6; several recent arrivals confirm frequent 2-period behavior. Inventory pipeline (229) already large vs recent weekly demand (many weeks with demand 50\u2013100, recent low weeks 22\u201338). To be conservative about promised lead time variability I let the backend calculate an average observed lead time (calculate). I use default demand and volatility computations so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given the large in-transit quantity and equal profit/holding cost.

Pipeline (240) will cover several weeks of expected demand so avoid aggressive uplifts to limit holding cost. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample statistics.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has downshifted from 100s in Feb\u2013Apr to ~30\u201360 in Jun\u2013Jul. On-hand=0, in-transit=240 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 with mixed observed 1\u20132 periods; no sustained change since Period 6 confirmed L=2. I set L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime (last 5 demands: 55,38,22,28,39; mean\u224836.4) and scale by (1+L)=3 for mu_hat. Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower variability. These parameters reduce excess ordering versus older high-demand periods while keeping service against short lead time and the sizable in-transit stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand (most recent 5 weeks: 38,22,28,39,54) averages ~36 units/week, lower than earlier season peaks. On-hand=0, in-transit=229 (ample pipeline covering multiple weeks). Observed lead times in concluded history alternate between 1 and 2 (several 2s and 1s); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Use a recent_N (N=5) demand estimate to capture the lower, sustained recent regime and reduce stock risk versus using the long-run mean. Apply recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep orders responsive to the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity minimizes stockout risk despite lead-time variability.

To reflect the recent low-demand regime while keeping safety for two-period lead, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime). This keeps target inventory modest given the large in-transit pipeline, reducing holding cost while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=229. Demand history shows intermittent weeks of high demand (several 50-160 samples) and mixed observed lead times of 1 or 2 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (recent observations: mix of 1 and 2 -> mean ~1.64) so the OR engine accounts for realized variability. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving full historical demand information. This balances service (capturing longer effective lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed lead times have mostly matched the promised 2 periods; demand history is noisy with many stockouts in recent weeks so no clear sustained demand regime change. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=229 \u2014 pipeline sufficient to cover multiple periods. I choose default lead time to trust the promised L=2 and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std (conservative given stockouts) to compute base-stock while respecting its cap.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand has been moderate but variable (last 5 demands: 54, 28, 72, 72, 98; mean=64.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=229 \u2014 sufficient to cover (1+L) periods at recent demand. Historical arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with prior confirmation of 2; no sustained lead-time shift in the last 3+ periods. To balance service vs holding cost: keep promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime while limiting exposure to older, higher-seasonal samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to recent demand variability and avoids overstocking given a high in-transit position.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent realized weekly demand has risen (last 6 concluded demands: 54,28,72,72,98,94; mean\u224869.7) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=229. Historical concluded arrivals support promised lead time ~2 (carry-over confirmed Period 6). Use promised lead time to keep timing consistent with supplier contract (method=default). Forecast demand using a recent window to capture the recent demand uptick (recent_N, N=6) so mu_hat reflects the current higher regime. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (higher target stock for elevated recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Given promised lead time=2 and mixed but not sustained LT increase, use default lead time. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs ($1/$1) and substantial pipeline inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 72,98,94,78,130) shows a higher recent mean (~94.4) vs. long-run; use recent_N=5 to capture this regime for demand mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised) so OR backend uses promised lead time while mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect recent elevated demand; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=260. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2); recent observed lead times = {P32:1, P23:2, P19:1, P17:2} \u2192 use recent average. Recent demand has stepped up in Sep (Period30-32: 130,124,123) so forecast should use the most recent weeks. I set L and demand parameters using recent_N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime while reflecting lead-time variability; sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock. These choices keep the backend's base-stock responsive to the recent demand spike and the observed 1\u20132 period lead-time pattern without overcommitting inventory given $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times vary but promised lead time=2 is supported by prior confirmations; no new sustained lead-time shift. Recent demand shows a major spike (Period 33 demand=230) but many earlier periods experienced stockouts; given large in-transit pipeline, use default demand/volatility estimates to let OR backend compute base stock. This conservatively avoids placing extra orders while awaiting confirmations of the recent spike and arrival confirmations for in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand history shows large weekly variability with some spikes (e.g., Period 33 demand=230) but no new sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=342 \u2014 this is substantial relative to historical mean demand (~85/week) and should cover the (1+L) demand window. Actual observed lead times have varied 1\u20132 but prior carry-over confirmed L=2; no new multi-period evidence of a different lead time or demand regime. I therefore use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance; this balances service (use pipeline) vs holding cost conservatively given high in-transit stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 with multiple outstanding shipments and observed variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods; recent P32\u2192P35 showed lead_time=3). Recent demand has risen (Periods 31\u201335 demands = 130,124,230,117,119; recent mean=144). To buffer against longer/more variable arrivals and higher recent demand I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative vs promised 2). I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the recent higher mean and volatility (N=5), which yields (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflecting current regime. This increases service-level target given profit=holding cost, while capping orders via backend cap to limit overstock from potentially lost shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has jumped (last 6 demands: 124,123,230,117,119,118; mean=138.5) and recent arrivals show longer lead times (two consecutive arrivals with lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 \u2014 substantial pipeline but variable lead-time. I choose L=recent_N (N=3) to bias the lead-time estimate toward the most recent observations (captures recent shift toward 3 while smoothing occasional 1s). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current higher-demand regime (uses last 6 periods: 124..118). Sigma uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility including the 230 spike. These settings aim to raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window given elevated demand while letting the capped ordering cap temper extreme orders given existing large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=453. Recent demand (Periods 33-37) jumped (230,117,119,118,115) suggesting a higher recent mean beginning at Period 33. Observed concluded lead times (14 samples) average \u22481.79 periods with recent volatility including two 3-period observations but not yet a sustained shift. To capture the recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers Periods 33-37). For lead time I use calculate (average of all observed concluded lead times \u22481.79) so the backend uses an L between 1 and 2 reflecting historical mixture of 1\u20133 period realizations. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover elevated recent demand) against holding cost, while relying on the averaged lead time to avoid overreacting to two isolated 3-period arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand (historical samples show high variability including several large weeks). Recent concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), but no sustained shift beyond the previously recorded confirmation of 2. To avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit position, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies historical mean/variance and caps orders appropriately.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=127, in-transit=229. Recent concludes show multiple 3-period lead times (orders P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39) indicating a persistent increase vs earlier 2-period behavior. Demand has been elevated since late Sep (several weekly demands >100, peak 230) \u2014 recent regime is higher than early-sample means. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures shift toward 3). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 8 weeks to reflect the higher recent demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to protect service during the longer, now-confirmed lead time while using recent demand stats to avoid overstock from older low-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 33 (sustained higher weekly demand: P33-P40 = [230,117,119,118,115,150,97,92]); on-hand=35, in-transit=274 which covers multiple weeks but some shipments previously showed extended lead times. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (recent confirms longer ~3 periods). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-Period-33 higher regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) vs holding costs by using observed pipeline (in-transit) and updated demand stats rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent concluded history shows lead times have shifted to ~3 periods (confirmed around Periods 32\u201339). Demand since early Oct is elevated relative to earlier months (recent 5-period mean \u2248110 units/wk). Set lead time to recent_N to reflect observed recent LT=3, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand and volatility over the last 5 concluded weeks. This increases the (1+L) forecast horizon and safety stock to reduce stockouts given longer observed lead time while controlling holding cost by limiting N to the most recent regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows a persistent increase in observed lead time to 3 periods (confirmed at Period 40 with multiple P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39 observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover several upcoming demands, so forecast should reflect recent higher demand regime (Nov demands ~115\u2013150). I set L to recent_N=3 to lock in the empirically observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the elevated late-2019 weekly demand; N=6 (most recent 6 demand observations) gives a representative mean for (1+L)-period demand. I also set sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned with observed longer lead times and recent higher demand while using pipeline inventory to avoid unnecessary extra orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=82, in-transit=229. Recent conclude messages (P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39, P40 arrivals at P43) show actual lead time increased to 3 periods versus promised 2; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Demand has recently been higher and more variable (notably P33 demand=230, P34-39 demands 117-150, recent demands P39-P43 = 97,92,95,109,44). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime while keeping N small but \u22653 to capture the most recent mean/volatility. This balances service (capture recent elevated demand) against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent concluded history shows sustained longer lead times (confirmed as 3 periods for multiple recent orders) and demand has been elevated and volatile in the last ~10 weeks (Periods 35\u201344 demands: 119,118,115,150,97,92,95,109,44,77). On-hand=5, in-transit=268 (pipeline substantial but arrivals subject to L=3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed recent actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. I set mu_hat using recent_N N=10 to capture the recent higher-demand regime over the next (1+L) review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher target stock to preserve service under longer lead time while using recent realized demand to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=402 (pipeline large). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand levels, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent two-month demand regime (captures recent weekly demand around Nov\u2013Dec and holiday variability). This increases pipeline coverage (1+L periods) while keeping variability driven by recent observations so the OR backend balances service level vs. holding cost given the sizeable in-transit stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent history shows confirmed longer lead-times (multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 in Periods 35,36,39,43) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=402 units. Given the recent persistent 3-period arrivals, I bias L toward recent observations. On-hand + in-transit (402) is large relative to typical weekly demand (~70\u2013120 recently) so pipeline coverage is high. Choices: L set via recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time regime (mostly 3); mu_hat set via recent_N (N=5) to base demand forecast on the last five demand observations (captures late-Nov/Dec demand levels); sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings tell the OR backend to plan to cover (1+L) periods using recent demand stats and to size safety stock to recent variability, while recognizing substantial in-transit stock to avoid excess ordering.
