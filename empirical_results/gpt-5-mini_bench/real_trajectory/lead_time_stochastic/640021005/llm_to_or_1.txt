Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=2. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean 12.4 units; no sustained changepoint or delivery evidence yet. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock with full-sample statistics; this balances service level against holding cost given no sign of regime shift or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=25 (order placed Period 1 not yet arrived \u2014 promised L=2 so arrival expected later). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=12.4, std\u22487.13. No concluded arrivals contradicting promised lead time; no sustained demand regime shift (only 5 samples). Use default lead time and default demand moments so backend uses promised L and full-sample statistics to compute base stock while accounting for the 3-period coverage (review+L). This keeps service-level reasoning conservative given in-transit order uncertainty.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=53 (matches orders P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples mean=12.4 units. Promised lead time=2 periods; I use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of demand/lead-time regime change and the current pipeline covering expected demand for upcoming periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=76 (orders 25+28+23). Recent demand has jumped (Periods1-3: 24,29,95 vs historical mean ~12.4). Orders placed in P1-P3 have not concluded by their promised lead time (promised L=2) \u2014 suggests longer lead time or lost shipments. To be cautious I set L explicit=3 to give extra protection vs. delayed arrivals. Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (focus on last three demands 24,29,95). This raises the base-stock to serve near-term surge while sigma based on same window reflects increased volatility; these choices trade higher service level now against holding cost given zero on-hand and substantial in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed P1-P3 (total 76) have not concluded by expected lead time \u2192 possible extended lead time or lost shipments; Demand regime shift beginning Period1: recent mean (Periods1-3)=49.33 vs historical mean=12.4 (+298%).

640021005: ordered=115, arrived=28 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=28, demand=174, sold=28, ending on-hand inventory=0

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 1-4 demand = 24,29,95,174) indicating a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1. Historical samples (earlier baseline) are much lower. Shipments: Period 2 order (28) arrived in Period 4, giving observed lead_time=2; other earlier orders remain in-transit. To capture the confirmed short lead time and elevated recent demand, set L by calculating the average observed lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 4 periods) so the OR engine targets higher base stock while reflecting recent variability. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts in the new high-demand regime) against holding cost, and accounts for potential lost/missing earlier shipments by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than assuming longer lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived on Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand has jumped sharply (Periods1-5 demands = 24,29,95,174,254; recent mean=115.2) vs historical sample mean=12.4\u2014this is a sustained regime shift (5 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=360; some earlier orders never concluded (lost/delayed) but Period 4 conclude confirmed a 2-period lead time (P2\u2192P4). I therefore keep L at promised/default (2) since confirmed, and set demand estimates from the recent 5-period regime to capture the much higher mean and volatility. Using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which raises target base-stock to meet the new demand while reflecting higher variance. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given the spike) against holding cost by relying on the observed recent demand and observed lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime (Periods 4-6 = 174,254,173; recent mean ~200). On-hand=24 + in-transit=430 covers many periods so no emergency order signal. Use promised lead time (default=2) since concluded history includes a 2-period arrival and the backend expects promised L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 3 demands). This focuses the OR backend on satisfying elevated demand while the large pipeline limits additional ordering and reduces holding vs stockout tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand (Periods1-7) shows a sustained large upward shift vs historical Jan samples (recent mean >> historical mean). Shipments have been inconsistent but concluded messages confirm some orders with 1-2 period lead times; no clear sustained change in lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates (all 7 recent samples). Keep L as promised to let OR engine assume 2 and use recent demand to size orders; sigma estimated from recent samples to reflect elevated variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 3 (P3-P8 demands: 95,174,254,173,243,578) so I use a recent-sample forecast. Lead times in concluded messages vary (observed: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1) so I let the backend calculate average observed lead time rather than trusting the promised value. Choices: L=calculate to reflect average observed lead time (captures 1\u20132 period variability); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u20138); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to cover the new high-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excessive inventory given variable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed across concluded arrivals: observed lead times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] indicating inconsistent 1\u20132 period lead times.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 P10. On-hand=0, in-transit=695. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) and recent demand is elevated (Periods6-9 = 173,243,578,216). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime reflected in the last four periods. Sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute appropriate safety stock given the inferred lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent history shows inconsistent 1\u20132 period lead times (observed LT samples: 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg=1.4) and a clear sustained demand upshift vs the older 5-sample baseline. On-hand=349, in-transit=772 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand has been high and variable; some earlier orders were delayed but recent concludes confirm arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period variability). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and current variance), which will raise the base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety when demand volatility is elevated. This balances profit-driven service level against holding cost given current high pipeline and observed demand regime shift.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent realized demand is much higher than historical samples (last 5 concluded demands: 243, 578, 216, 183, 138 \u2192 mean 271.6) and observed lead times vary 1\u20132 periods. On-hand=211, in-transit=772 (large pipeline) so we avoid inflating demand estimate further but must tell the OR engine the higher recent demand regime. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 variability). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples) so base-stock and cap reflect elevated mean and volatility while respecting existing pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=49, in-transit=1105 \u2014 large pipeline so no emergency order needed; historical samples (Jan-Feb) show low demand but last 12 periods exhibit a sustained high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] -> avg ~1.4; I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N with N=12 (using the last 12 demand samples) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to the current elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): recent demand regime is substantially higher than historical (sustained high demand through Periods 1\u201313). On-hand=0, in-transit=1105 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (variable ~1\u20132, avg ~1.4). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 12 periods' demand to forecast (1+L)-period demand). For sigma I use recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward servicing the new high-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure but high mu_hat ensures sufficient target inventory to avoid lost sales given lead-time variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=216, in-transit=772. Historical concluded lead times show inconsistent 1\u20132 period arrivals (observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2], avg=1.5) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (recent periods much higher than original historical sample). To reflect observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (calculate). For demand I use the recent regime (last 12 concluded demand periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 to capture the elevated mean and volatility across the (review+lead) window. These choices aim to raise the base stock for the higher demand regime while letting the OR engine incorporate the computed lead-time and volatility into service-level sizing, balancing profit vs. holding cost given abundant pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime (recent means ~189/week vs historical ~12). On-hand=0, in-transit=772 (covers several weeks of elevated demand but some past orders were delayed). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2] (avg 1.5) showing 1\u20132 period variability; use backend-calculated average lead time to let OR blend 1\u20132 period behavior. To capture the elevated demand regime I use recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 12 weeks of high demand and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples. These choices help the OR backend size base stock for higher current demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability through the calculated L.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows large, sustained demand increases since Period1 and variable lead times (observed LT samples = [2,1,2,1,1,2], avg\u22481.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1015 which materially covers many future periods. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the OR engine capture the realized 1\u20132 period variability. For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full historical data while the calculated L raises coverage for multi-period demand and protects against lost/delayed arrivals. High profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) implies a high service level; using calculated L with default mu/sigma balances service vs extra holding given a large in-transit buffer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=118, in-transit=772. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20132 periods); average of observed concluded lead times is preferred over promised. Demand has shifted to a much higher regime (sustained elevated demand through Period 12+), so use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new mean and volatility. Choices: L set to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (captures 1\u20132 period variability); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)-period demand mean and std on the most recent 12 periods (matches detected sustained regime change), which raises target base-stock to maintain service while the sigma estimate captures increased demand variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost since on-hand + large in-transit already provide coverage but pipeline may include delayed/lost orders.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = [2,1,2,1,1,2,1], avg \u22481.43) so I use calculated average lead time rather than promised 2. Demand has clearly shifted to a much higher regime (sustained high weekly sales across recent periods); I therefore base mu_hat and sigma_hat on recent samples to capture the new mean and volatility. Choices: L by "calculate" to capture observed average \u22481.43; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce overweighting older low-demand samples. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat from recent data sets safety stock consistent with recent variability.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (recent elevated means through P12 and beyond); use recent_N with N=12 to capture the recent high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained elevated weekly demand across recent periods). To reflect the observed shorter-than-promised average lead time while capturing variability, set L by averaging recent observed lead times (recent_N=8). For demand, use a recent-window forecast to capture the new high-demand regime; set mu_hat recent_N with N=12 (captures the most recent demand behavior over ~3 months). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher recent demand while using an empirically inferred shorter lead time to avoid excessive hold costs given large in-transit volume.

Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; recent average used. I set L using recent_N to reflect observed 1\u20132 variability (N=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime in the last 12 periods so the OR backend will raise base stock to meet service while accounting for pipeline. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by sizing forecast around the recent high-demand regime and using recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (carry-over notes) and observed lead times varying 1\u20132 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=860 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with mixed 1\u20132 period lags and some earlier missing arrivals. To capture actual lead-time variability I request the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent-window estimate to reflect the sustained high-demand regime rather than the small historical sample from 2019-Jan: set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent N periods to adapt to the regime shift (N=12 chosen to cover the recent high-demand pattern while staying within the regime detection rules). This balances service (by sizing (1+L)*mean to recent elevated demand) against holding cost (using recent volatility for safety stock).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained large weekly demand since Period1 of this run); on-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). To reflect observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime using recent_N=12 (covers the most recent 12 demand observations) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand level and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts while large pipeline exists) against holding cost because pipeline is already large; using recent data avoids under-forecasting the sustained high demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (sustained large weekly sales; recent weeks 100\u2013281). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 \u2014 ample pipeline covering many weeks so no emergency top-up. Lead times observed variable (1\u20132 periods); use calculated average to let backend infer current mean LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained elevated regime (last 12 concluded weeks) so mu_hat reflects current high demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR base-stock toward higher safety stock appropriate for the new regime while relying on the large in-transit quantity to avoid over-ordering now.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; recent concluded pattern and prior confirmations justify using the empiric average lead time rather than the promised default. Demand has shifted to a much higher regime (sustained high weekly sales across recent periods), so I base demand forecast on recent samples to capture the new mean and volatility. Choices: L set to 'calculate' to average observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 period variability); mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to use the most recent regime data (stabilizes forecast around the elevated demand and its volatility). This keeps orders aligned with the large in-transit volume while ensuring the OR backend computes a base-stock that reflects the new high-demand regime and the observed lead-time variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained large weekly demand since Period 1 of this trace); on-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline but some earlier orders have delayed/concluded variably). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I select recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the recent high-demand regime (captures recent variability while limiting influence of the small historical pre-shift samples). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime for many periods (Periods 13-27 average ~150 units/week) vs historical low samples \u2014 I therefore base demand forecasts on recent data. Lead time has shown 1\u20132 period variability but promised lead time=2 remains reasonable for the OR engine; in-transit=860 units provides substantial coverage vs (1+L)\xd7recent mean but OR backend will cap orders. Choices: L=default to use promised lead time (2) so backend applies its lead-time assumptions; mu_hat=recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (uses last 15 samples); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=15 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters shift ordering to reflect the new higher demand while relying on the large in-transit stock to avoid immediate stockouts and limit excessive new orders given holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has been persistently high since early periods (sustained regime shift previously recorded); on-hand=0, in-transit=860 which already covers many future periods. Lead times observed vary between 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average to let backend infer current central tendency from concluded arrivals. For demand forecast, use recent_N (last 12 demand samples) to capture the new high-demand regime while limiting older low-demand influence. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (higher mu_hat for the sustained high regime) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent weeks >> historical pre-shift samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are only observed with conclude messages and lead times have varied 1\u20132 periods historically. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline). This avoids diluting the forecast with much smaller historical pre-shift samples and lets the OR engine compute a base-stock tuned to current demand and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime (many weeks 120\u2013195 units); on-hand=0, in-transit=860 which is ample pipeline. Observed concluded lead times are variable (1\u20132 periods); using the empirical average avoids overcommitting to promised LT=2. Set L via calculate (average of all observed lead times). For demand, use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand history. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that matches current high demand while the calculated L accounts for observed LT variability, reducing stockouts from underestimated LT and avoiding excess holding by using recent demand stats.

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; recent concluded data sparse but mixed, so use averaged observed lead time to capture variability. Demand has been elevated and stable in recent weeks (many periods with 126\u2013195 units); use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 12 samples to reflect current regime. sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale variability with chosen L.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 \u2014 ample pipeline vs recent high weekly demand (~125\u2013195/week since Period 13). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods across many arrivals; use averaged observed lead time (calculate) so OR backend reflects realized variability. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime beginning Period 1 (sustained since P1\u2013P12+); use recent_N to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent stable regime (last 12 concluded demand samples, Periods 22\u201333) so forecasts capture current elevated mean and volatility. This avoids overreacting to early low historical samples while letting the OR engine compute safety stock and caps under the averaged lead time. No immediate explicit correction for lost shipments because pipeline shows large in-transit quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=860. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20132 periods) but average appears closer to ~1.3; many past periods saw timely 1\u20132 period arrivals and no new sustained regime change in demand since Period13. In-transit volume (860) is large relative to recent weekly demand (~130\u2013190) so avoid inflating forecast; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability and rely on default demand/statistics to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline). Historical data shows a sustained high-demand regime vs earlier baseline (carry-over noted: recent mean ~189 units). Lead-time observations vary 1\u20132 periods but most recent system promise=2; use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. To reflect the elevated, sustained demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 12 demand samples to capture current mean/volatility while limiting noise from older low-demand history. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20132 periods) so use backend 'calculate' to let observed concluded lead times set L. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (documented in history); to prioritize recent demand while smoothing noise I select an EWMA forecast for mu_hat with moderate memory (gamma=0.3). Volatility estimate left to backend default (uses all samples) because sufficient historical variability exists and pipeline is large. These choices balance service (use observed lead-time average) and holding cost (EWMA avoids overreacting to single spikes while pipeline already provides coverage).

Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=860. Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (sustained high weekly demand since early periods); use recent_N (last 12 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=860 \u2014 healthy pipeline but some past shipments were delayed/lost; concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods. I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures observed 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (last 20 periods) rather than diluted long-run historical samples; this biases orders toward meeting current high demand while letting the backend compute safety stock via sigma_hat to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=860. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead times sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2) \u2014 recent behavior is 1\u20132 periods, so I use a recent average rather than the promised default. Demand has clearly shifted upward vs the 2019-Jan baseline; recent weeks (many periods) show sustained high weekly demand, so I use a recent-window forecast for both mean and volatility to reflect the new regime. Choices: L -> recent_N (captures current 1\u20132 period mix using last 5 observed lead-times); mu_hat -> recent_N with N=12 to capture the elevated recent average demand across the review+lead window; sigma_hat -> recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward higher coverage of the sustained higher demand while letting the capped order limit control extreme replenishment given in-transit stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has declined from mid-year peaks; on-hand=0, in-transit=860 (large pipeline). Historical lead time observations vary between 1\u20132 periods; promised lead time is 2. Given a very large in-transit position, I will not assume a longer lead time or change demand estimates now \u2014 avoid additional ordering pressure. Use default lead time (promised=2) so OR backend applies its lead-time assumption, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps orders conservative while the sizeable pipeline clears, balancing service vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=860. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals; using observed average lead time better captures variability than promised. I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (~1.44). Demand experienced a sustained regime jump earlier (entered in history); I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service vs holding cost given the computed L. Large in-transit inventory reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average to let backend infer current typical lead time. Demand has been variable with a sustained higher regime earlier; to be responsive to recent pattern I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 demand samples (captures ~3 months). This balances service (use recent demand to size the (1+L) review+lead forecast) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Observed concluded lead times have varied 1\u20132 periods, but promised lead time remains 2; I keep L=default so OR backend uses the contractual 2-period lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since early periods (confirmed previously); to capture recent elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (covers the most recent weeks to reflect the regime shift and recent volatility). This biases ordering toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while the pipeline arrival is confirmed.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods); average observed lead time ~1.44 \u2192 use calculated average. Recent observed demand (most recent weeks) is lower than earlier spikes; to capture the current demand regime I use recent_N over the last 12 demand samples for both mean and std. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock with updated lead-time and short-term demand estimates, balancing service level against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=860. Historical concludes show variable lead times (mixture of 1\u20132 periods) but no new sustained shift since prior insights. Recent realized customer demand (most recent 12 weeks, Periods 34\u201345) averages ~50.6/week, well below the mid-year spike; using a short recent window captures the current lower-demand regime ahead of Christmas. Choose L as the calculated (average observed lead time) to let the backend reconcile 1\u20132 period variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 demand samples to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding when in-transit is large.
