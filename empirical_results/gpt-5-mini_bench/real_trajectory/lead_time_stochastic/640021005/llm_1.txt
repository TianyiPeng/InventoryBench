======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, approaching New Year) \u2014 apparel demand typically soft in late Dec. Demand analysis: recent periods show a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 40-46 demands = 24,31,78,25,17,28,8; avg \u224830.1 over 7 periods), well below earlier regimes (~59 at Periods 36-39 and ~159 earlier). Lead-time / pipeline: history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and occasional lost shipments; current observation reports In-transit=405 units and On-hand=0, so there is a large pipeline already. Inventory assessment: with 405 units in-transit and current low-demand (~30/week), on-hand + pipeline covers many future periods even with lead-time uncertainty. Decision: place no new order to avoid high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and risk of overstock during a low-demand season; monitor arrivals and demand next periods and only reorder when pipeline is consumed and demand evidence warrants replenishment.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 47: recent demand decreased further from prior ~59 (Periods 36-39 avg=58.75) to ~30.1 (Periods 40-46 avg=30.1), sustained for 7 periods.",
