{
  "rationale": "Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large). Recent demand is low and stable (Periods 34\u201346 avg \u224814/week); carry-over already records prior regime shifts and lost P1 shipment. Lead time: concluded history shows mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but no new sustained lead-time change. Cost tradeoff: profit=$1 and holding=$1 so critical fractile=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock premium; OR recommended 0 which aligns with low recent demand. Risk: with 327 in-transit, placing new orders will raise holding cost without increasing expected sales. Decision: place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding costs and let existing pipeline fulfill demand.",
