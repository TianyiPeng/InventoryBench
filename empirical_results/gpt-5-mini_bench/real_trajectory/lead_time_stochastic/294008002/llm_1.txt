Lead time / pipeline: in-transit = 347 units but historical carry-over notes indicate many long-overdue/lost shipments; arrival pattern has been inconsistent though earlier evidence pointed to 2-period arrivals. Inventory economics: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 high holding relative to profit makes carrying inventory costly. Given promised 2-period lead time, any order placed now would not arrive until after two periods (arriving too late to meet immediate demand) and would likely sit and incur holding cost equal to profit before being sold. With low expected demand and high holding cost, placing a new order risks incurring holding costs that eliminate profit (and risks loss if shipments fail). Action: do not order this period and avoid adding to an already-problematic in-transit pipeline.",
