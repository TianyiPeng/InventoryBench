Running full CSV horizon: 47 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb 2019) will be used as baseline. Promised lead time = 0; no evidence to alter it. Use default lead time so backend uses promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline given limited data and symmetric profit/holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time (avg observed = 0). Demand history mean used to set forecast: use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample stats (no recent regime detected) balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand 0, in-transit 0. Concluded arrivals in Periods 1-2 show lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). Recent realized demand: P1=37, P2=55; historical samples (Jan weeks) mean ~43.6. I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (avg=0). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast on the five historical weekly samples while accounting for current weeks; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean of those samples. sigma_hat use default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices keep safety stock moderate given confirmed short lead time and mixed recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demands (Periods 1-3 conclude) = 37, 55, 55; historical sample (Jan) mean = 43.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to cover (1+L) periods. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-3), so set L by calculating observed lead time. Demand appears elevated recently vs Jan baseline, so use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture current regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase forecasted base_stock to improve service given zero inventory while keeping volatility estimate recent to avoid overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) = 43.6; recent Periods 1-3 mean = 49.0 (+12.4%)

Daily Profit: $37.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand 12, in-transit 0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders in Periods 1-4 all arrived same period (lead_time=0) so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand recent regime (Periods 2-4) shows elevated mean ~49 units (Period2=55, Period3=55, Period4=37); I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) to capture this regime. Set L to use confirmed short lead time, mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the higher recent mean over the review+lead horizon, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices provide the OR backend a demand forecast aligned to the recently observed regime while leveraging confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given zero actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1-4 orders all arrived in same period: P1->P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P5) shows actual lead time = 0 each period; no overdue shipments. Demand has risen recently (carry-over noted: recent P1\u2013P3 mean = 49 vs historical 43.6). To respond to the higher recent demand while leveraging confirmed 0 lead time, set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime (short window to capture the +12% uplift). This raises target base-stock to improve service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=43.6 but recent demand shows a downward regime in Periods 4-6 (37,30,43; mean\u224836.7). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To prioritize recent pattern, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 3-period demand regime and variance; this keeps orders aligned with the current lower demand and avoids excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a modest upward demand shift vs historical baseline. Profit=Holding, so service quantile q=0.5 (z\u22480) \u2014 base stock should track mean demand across review+lead. I set L by observed lead times (calculate) to confirm LT=0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (Periods 3\u20137 demand: 55,37,30,43,45) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, balancing fill-rate with holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows one large spike (Period 8=83) but no sustained new regime; observed lead time consistently 0 in concluded history. Use promised/default lead time to keep arrivals same-period. To balance service vs holding cost, set demand estimate using recent_N=5 (captures last 5 weeks including the spike) and match volatility with recent_N=5 so the OR engine raises safety stock modestly for the observed variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrival (lead time=0). No overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has stepped up (last 5 concluded demands = 30,43,45,83,41; mean \u224848.4) versus older baseline. Use promised lead time (0) and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to capture the higher recent regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window. These params give the OR engine an updated short-horizon forecast to balance service (cover current period demand after decision) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. To better match recent regime, set L from observed lead times and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so OR base-stock reflects the higher recent demand while keeping holding risk controlled.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P11 arrivals all same-period). Recent demand shows an upward shift vs. the original 5-sample baseline (historical mean 43.6): last 5 observed demands = [83,41,58,64,?] (using the most recent 5 concluded periods) indicating higher mean and volatility. To capture the recent regime, use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher demand and variability; keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded data confirms 0. This balances service (raise base stock to meet elevated demand) while acknowledging holding cost by using a recent-window estimate rather than full-history smoothing. No missing shipments detected.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pipeline coverage. Historical baseline (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) mean=43.6, but recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last 5 demands (P8\u2013P12) = [83,41,58,64,73], mean=63.8 (+46% vs baseline) and elevated volatility. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To respond to the higher recent demand while avoiding excessive holding, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and cap from the latest regime; L uses default (promised) since observed lead time=0 and no evidence of loss.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows repeated same-period arrivals (all concluded orders P1->P1 ... P13->P13) and demand spikes in recent weeks (several periods with demand >> historical Jan-Feb samples); current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish immediately. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all available demand history while keeping the replenishment target aligned to the confirmed zero lead time and balancing service level versus holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently; recent demand shows high variability with one large spike (Period 14 demand=163) but not a sustained regime shift. To let the OR engine use its full historical statistics and promised lead time, I select defaults: use promised L, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service-level vs holding cost while avoiding overreacting to a single-period spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has sharply increased: Periods 13-15 = [79,163,141], indicating a new high-demand regime starting Period 13. All concluded lead-time observations show 0 periods (orders in P1-P15 arrived same period). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new regime (Periods 13-15). I also use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated recent mean while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 0 to avoid unnecessary pipeline build-up and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show persistent zero lead time (orders arrived same period) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 (large jump to ~128 avg). Reconcile: no pipeline, so must order for (1+L) periods. Choose L by calculating average of observed lead times (all observed = 0). For demand, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the new higher mean: N=4 (Periods 13-16) per changepoint detection rules. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect increased volatility in the new regime. These settings steer the OR backend to set a base-stock matching the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 13 (week-of-2019-05-06); last 5 demands = [79,163,141,139,105], mean \u2248125.4. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero and current cover is low vs. elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default L=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 periods to capture the new high-demand regime (N=5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent data.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand since Period 13 is in a higher regime (~126 avg). On-hand=46, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). To match the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility (periods 14-18 demands = 163,141,139,105,80; mean \u2248125.6) with L=default (promised 0). This gives the OR engine a forecast focused on the recent high-demand regime while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0 to avoid overestimating pipeline. Profit=holding so service level q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 using recent_N concentrates orders around the observed elevated demand and limits holding cost risk.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 13 (post-change weekly mean much higher ~127.7). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand=6, in-transit=0 and recent weekly demands (Periods 13-19) form the new demand regime. To capture the post-change regime I use recent_N=7 (Periods 13-19) for demand mean and volatility. For lead time I use calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (0). These choices bias orders toward the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time realistic, improving service with acceptable holding cost trade-off.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P20) consistently show actual lead time = 0; a sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 13 with much higher weekly demand (recent avg \u2248127.7 vs historical 43.6). No overdue/lost shipments. Set L to calculate to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. For demand, use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 13\u201320) to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to the elevated mean and variability, balancing service (avoid stockouts given strong demand) against holding cost.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 0 periods (confirmed P1->P1 ... P22->P22), so use promised lead time. Demand shifted up starting Period 13 (sustained higher mean ~127.67); recent regime spans Periods 13\u201322 (10 samples). To align the OR base-stock with the new higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (regime length=10) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over this high-demand regime. This balances service (to avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Lead time has been consistently same-period in history so use promised/default L. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the post-Period-13 regime (N=11, Periods 13-23) so base_stock reflects the higher demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=11 to capture current volatility. This raises target base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma preserves safety stock; with profit=holding, q=0.5 so z*=0 and mu_hat effectively sets the order target to balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (many Pn->Pn arrivals). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 13 (post-change avg \u2248127.67); use the recent high-demand regime to size orders. Set L to promised/default (0) consistent with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Periods 13\u201324) to reflect the new regime and balance service level against holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 with mean rising to ~127.7; recent weeks remain in this higher regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. To reflect the post-changepoint demand level, set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (Periods 13\u201325, regime_length=13 \u2192 N=13) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the higher demand and volatility. This raises the base-stock to improve service under the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability; default L keeps arrivals same-period as observed, avoiding unnecessary pipeline inflation. Inventory (29 on-hand, no in-transit) is low relative to the new regime, so these parameters will prompt replenishment to cover expected demand.

Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (avg \u2248127.7) so I use recent-demand estimates to reflect the new regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. Choose L=default to use promised 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=14 (regime length from P13\u2013P26 = 14 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most relevant recent samples; this balances service (capture elevated demand) versus holding cost while avoiding older low-demand data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 13 (post-May): higher weekly demand (~127.7 avg since P13 vs historical ~43.6). Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the new higher mean/volatility: set N=15 (Period13\u2013Period27 = 15 samples). This gives the OR engine a forecast (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility focused on the current high-demand regime, improving service while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0). Demand regime since Period 13 is materially higher (~100+ weekly) versus historical pre-period13 mean 43.6. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime and recent weeks, set lead time to promised (default L=0) and forecast demand using the last 10 weeks to capture the post-changepoint mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand regime (from Period 13 onward) is elevated (~100+ weekly); on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the post-Period-13 high regime: choose N=17 (Periods 13\u201329 inclusive) which covers the full sustained high-demand regime. Use the same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned to the new higher mean while the OR backend will cap orders; this balances service (avoid stockouts given zero pipeline) against holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime increase since Period 13. No new sustained changepoint in recent periods (demand in P30=61). Use promised lead time (default) since arrivals have been consistently 0 delay. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock balanced by q=0.5 (z*=0). This keeps ordering responsive to the confirmed higher demand while avoiding additional holding risk given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 13 (avg since P13 >> earlier mean). I set L to use the promised/default behavior (0) and select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the regime since Period 13. Regime length = 19 periods (P13\u2013P31), so N=19; this captures the elevated mean and volatility to size the base-stock and the cap appropriately, balancing service (high recent demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1..P32 all arrived same period). Demand history shows the higher post-Period-13 regime sustained; recent demand has moderated. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=$1, holding=$1 so critical fractile=0.5), use promised/default lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level/volatility (weeks P28\u2013P32) so base-stock targets reflect current demand rather than older low/volatile samples. This balances fill rate with holding cost given current on-hand=59 and zero in-transit.

I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N based on the sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 13; regime length from P13 to P33 = 21, so choose N=20 (cap at 20) to capture recent high-demand behavior and reduce influence of pre-shift low demand. This raises base_stock to cover the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (periods 1-35 arrivals same period). Demand recently reverted to ~50 units/week (last 5 demands: 47,40,84,47,27; mean\u224849). There is an earlier sustained high-demand regime (Period 13) but recent 5-period behavior is closer to pre-spike levels, so forecast should reflect recent demand. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. I set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to target the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent week-level demand. sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L), providing conservative safety while letting OR backend compute service level via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained across many periods). A major demand regime shift occurred starting Period 13 (mean rose sharply to ~127.7) and has persisted; therefore I base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained regime length, capped at 20) so the OR engine will compute (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std over the last 20 samples \u2014 this prioritizes service during the higher-demand regime while the backend cap prevents extreme single-period orders, balancing profit versus holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1->P37). Recent demand (Periods 31-37 = 47,40,84,47,27,29,33) averages ~43.9, similar to historical non-peak regime. No new sustained changepoint detected. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest 7-week regime (N=7). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep orders responsive to current lower-demand regime while preserving service-level against short-term variability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Lead time historically confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 34-38 = 47,27,29,33,26) shows a sustained downshift vs. the mid-year spike; on-hand=20, in-transit=0 so risk of near-term stockout exists but recent mean demand is low. I use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower regime (stabilized last 5 periods). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to target ~one-period recent demand while keeping holding cost low given low current on-hand and low recent demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent 10-week demand (Periods 30-39) mean ~41.9, showing demand lower than the earlier spike (Period 13+). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent post-spike demand regime and reduce carry-over of the prior high-demand spike; this balances service (captures recent demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 30-40) has been lower than mid-year spike, so use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid overstock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11 = Periods 30-40) to capture the current lower-demand regime and lower volatility, which reduces recommended base-stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the observed recent demand pattern.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 periods consistently (orders in prior periods all arrived same period). No new sustained demand regime detected recently. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times (0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with profit=holding cost the backend will target median-like service (q=0.5). These choices keep ordering anchored to long-run demand while respecting confirmed zero lead time and avoiding overstock given holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=0 (many P concludes P same period). Profit=1, Holding=1 => service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock equals mu_hat; using defaults keeps backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples to reflect long-run demand including the large mid-year regime shift. Default L (promised 0) matches observed on-time arrivals and avoids overcompensating for transient fluctuations given current modest on-hand.

On-hand=47, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking before holiday-season variability settles, use recent demand to set forecast and volatility. L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent regime while smoothing week-to-week noise and limiting exposure to the mid-year high-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime earlier in year but December weekly demand has fallen (Periods 43-46 = 17,19,27,20). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. On-hand=7, in-transit=0, so pipeline is empty. To reflect the recent lower seasonal demand while respecting confirmed L=0, I set L to default (promised), use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand to the last 4 weeks, and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the current low-December demand and limits excess holding cost given profit=holding, while allowing the backend to compute a conservative capped order.
