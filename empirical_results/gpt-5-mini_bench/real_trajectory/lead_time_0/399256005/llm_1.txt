Product: women's skinny ankle jeans \u2014 staple item with steady demand. Demand analysis: historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07:41, 2019-01-14:38, 2019-01-21:65, 2019-01-28:85, 2019-02-04:137.

Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so no coverage for current-period demand. Decision logic: Holding cost ($1) is small relative to profit ($19) so the penalty for slight overstock is low while stockouts for accelerating demand are costly.
