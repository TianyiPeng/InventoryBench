Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [45,52,45,54,47], mean=48.6, std\u22484.16. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (cover ~48.6 units/week) vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed on Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0). No overdue shipments. I set L via "calculate" to let backend compute the average of observed lead times (evidence supports 0). For demand I use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) which leverage the provided historical weekly samples (mean ~48.6) and keep the OR engine's statistical estimates consistent with available history while avoiding overfitting to a single short-run period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Observed arrivals from Periods 1\u20132 show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demands: Period1=49, Period2=67; historical weekly samples (Jan) mean ~48. Use promised/default lead time (0). No clear sustained demand regime shift (67 is a single spike), so use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine grounded on full-sample stats while avoiding overreacting to one high week; it balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan) mean=48.6; recent periods (P1-P3) observed demand = [49,67,76], recent mean=64 (+31.7%). Lead times observed in concluded history are all 0. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (0). I use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed uptick in demand (use the last 3 periods: 49,67,76) so the base-stock reflects the new higher regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices raise target stock to meet higher demand while keeping volatility and holding cost assessed on the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019/2/11\u20132019/2/25): prior mean=48.6 (Jan samples) \u2192 recent mean=64 (Periods 1\u20133), +31.7% (3 periods of higher demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has shifted up starting Period 1 (recent demands: 49, 67, 76, 75) \u2014 sustained higher regime. Set L using observed lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers the 4 most recent periods) so the OR engine builds base stock around the elevated mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher demand) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs. Jan: demands P1\u2013P5 = {49,67,76,75,73} with no lost or delayed arrivals (all observed lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus lead. I set L=default because observed concluded lead times are consistently 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 5 weeks to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases orders upward to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock calibrated to recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 1\u20133 after shift) vs. historical Jan samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus lead coverage. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (three most recent demand observations drive (1+L)*mean). Use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-variance samples. This balances higher service level for the new regime while avoiding overstating variance from older data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders in Periods 1\u20137 arrived same period). Demand has been elevated and growing (demands in Periods 1\u20137: 49,67,76,75,73,87,109). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and keep service while holding cost equals profit, I use an L estimated from observed lead times and set demand estimates using the recent 7-week regime to capture current mean/volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20138) show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 each time), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 1 and persisted through Periods 1\u20138 (sustained higher demand vs. Jan baseline). To capture the sustained uplift and recent variability, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat to base the forecast on the last 8 observed demand periods (captures the ongoing higher-demand regime). Use recent_N with N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and avoid understocking while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent weeks (Periods 1\u20139) show sustained higher demand vs Jan baseline and increasing volatility (demand series: 49,67,76,75,73,87,109,125,87). I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the new higher mean and increased variability from the most recent 9 observations, so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock to improve service while the capped order limits control peak orders and holding cost.

Demand has risen and been elevated across the full recent history (Periods 1\u201310); to capture the current regime and variability I use recent_N over the last 10 periods for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine raises base stock to meet higher demand while reflecting increased variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historic concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Demand has been elevated and volatile since the regime shift noted in Period 4; to capture the recent higher mean/variance I use a recent_N window of the last 6 demand observations (Periods 6\u201311) so the OR backend targets supply to recent realized demand and balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (weekly demands well above Jan baseline). All observed lead times = 0 (orders in history concluded with lead_time 0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across all available concluded periods (so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 12 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=12 so sigma_hat reflects recent demand variability. These settings replenish to cover the current elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent data avoids underordering given zero on-hand/in-transit and keeps holding cost considered via the backend formula.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=20, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; recent demand has been elevated compared with Jan baseline. Lead time observed consistently 0 in concluded history, so use calculate to confirm. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent elevated regime while meeting the N rules) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current higher demand level and reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting N to recent data rather than all historical samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Promised lead time = 0 and all observed concluded lead times = 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201314 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been higher than the Jan baseline (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0. To capture the sustained higher recent demand and reduce stockouts I use recent_N estimates over the most recent 6 demand observations (captures the post-shift regime while keeping N \u22653 and \u226420). I keep L=default (promised 0). Recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_recent so the base stock and cap reflect the higher recent mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (matches promised), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has fluctuated but no new sustained regime change since prior insight; full-sample mean (~91.9/week) remains the best stable estimate for the review+lead period. Given profit=holding, target service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) so using default mu_hat and default sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances service vs holding without overreacting to short recent dips. No overdue/lost shipments to reconcile.

Demand has been elevated vs. Jan baseline; recent weeks show variable but generally higher demand. No overdue or lost shipments to account for. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) since concluded history consistently shows 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand pattern (captures the latest regime and avoids diluting with older low-Jan samples), balancing service and holding costs given profit=holding.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 13\u201317 = 78,77,53,89,88) is lower volatility than earlier spikes but represents the most relevant regime for next-period demand; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next review period. Set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time remains 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 13\u201317 average \u224877 units) so the base-stock reflects current demand. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability for safety stock calculation. This balances service (meeting current demand) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5, lower z*).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent weeks show volatile demand with several high-demand spikes but no evidence of lead-time deviation: all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so available stock is low; next period demand will occur after this decision. To avoid overfitting to recent spikes while the series remains noisy, use the environment defaults: keep promised lead time and let the OR engine compute demand forecast from all historical samples. This balances service (captures long-run mean/variance) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: Periods 15\u201319 demands = 53,89,88,60,135) has higher mean and volatility than the long-run Jan samples, so I bias forecasts toward recent demand. Set L='calculate' to use observed lead times (average of concluded lead times = 0). Set mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to capture current elevated mean across the review+lead window. Set sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility; this helps the OR backend compute a higher base stock to protect service level while the capped order will limit extreme over-ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent weeks show elevated summer demand versus earlier samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current + next periods. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised L. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent 8 demand samples (captures late-May/June spikes) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast while letting the OR backend apply its cap to limit overshoot given equal profit/holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals all show lead_time=0, so keep L as default. Recent demand (Periods 17\u201321 = 88, 60, 135, 163, 85) is substantially above the early-sample mean; use recent_N (N=5) to capture current summer/high-demand regime for both forecast mean and volatility.

Demand history shows variability but no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. To keep policy aligned with the environment and the backend's expectations, use default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples.

Use default sigma_hat (std of all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to let OR engine reflect overall observed volatility. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping volatility estimate conservative.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time=0 (all concluded arrivals had W=0). Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P23\u2013P27 = 69,136,107,73,63) averages ~89.6, higher than long-run mean, so I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current summer regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded lead-time observations are consistently 0. mu_hat use recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)*mean of the last 5 samples and respond to the recent elevated demand. sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety sizing aligned with current variability. These choices give the OR engine a short lead-time, up-to-date demand mean and variance so base_stock and cap are computed to balance service vs holding given profit=holding.

Recent sales (Periods 24\u201328) show a lower-but-still-elevated regime vs. Jan samples; use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 weeks) so mu_hat reflects current weekly demand (~86) and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand while limiting holding given profit=holding (service quantile 0.5).

Recent observations show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded shift. On-hand=27, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I select default lead time to trust promised 0, and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level with holding cost given stable lead-time evidence and no new changepoint.

No sustained new demand regime since prior recorded insight. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed operations, set L=default (promised lead time), and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level given steady observed lead time while avoiding unnecessary inventory from manual over-adjustment.

Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (all concluded arrivals showed 0). To avoid excess holding while matching current lower demand, set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the most recent 4 samples. This adapts quickly to the sustained drop seen since early Sept and keeps base-stock conservative given equal profit/holding.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 30 (demands P30\u2013P33 = 41,11,14,24) vs prior months (typical weekly demand ~70\u2013130). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments; historical actual lead time = 0. To adapt quickly to the new low-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and estimate demand using the most recent 4 periods (changepoint at Period 30). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect reduced variability. This reduces order targets and holding cost while preserving service for the lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: recent avg (P30\u2013P33)=22.5 vs prior typical avg ~85\u2013100 (~75% drop) \u2014 sustained 4 periods

No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0). To avoid overstocking, keep L as default (promised 0) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat using recent_N over P30\u2013P34 (N=5) and match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower mean and volatility.

Promised lead time history shows actual lead time 0 for concluded orders (consistent). To avoid overstock in this low-demand regime, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the 6 most recent samples (captures the post-P30 lower-demand regime and its variability), which lets the OR engine compute a smaller base stock and reduce holding costs while maintaining service given current low demand.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently when orders arrived; no sustained evidence to change promised lead time. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P36 demands: 41,11,14,24,26,26,21 \u2014 7 periods). To reflect the recent sustained lower demand, set L to default (promised 0) and forecast demand using the recent regime (recent_N with N=7). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given low recent demand while keeping lead-time as promised.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 30 (P30\u2013P37 demand = [41,11,14,24,26,26,21,15], avg\u224824) vs prior higher levels. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead times in concluded messages have been 0, so preserve default lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=8 periods, P30\u2013P37). This reduces forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility so the OR backend will lower base-stock and cap orders, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

To avoid overstock while preserving service in this sustained lower-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast/volatility using the most recent 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). SKU 396135007 on-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (sustained ~10 periods). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (the recent low-demand regime length) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base_stock reflects the sustained lower demand and reduces holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (sustained drop); recent demands (P36\u2013P40 = 21,15,14,9,16) have mean ~15. To avoid overstock while meeting near-term demand, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 observations to capture the current low-demand regime; set sigma_hat from the same 5 recent observations to reflect current volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the low-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1 => q=0.5).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period \u2014 no evidence of delay or lost shipments. Recent demand since Period 35 is substantially lower than earlier seasons (sustained low regime noted in carry-over). To make the OR backend responsive to the current low-demand regime, set L to default (use promised lead time=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 7 concluded demand samples (Periods 35\u201341) to capture the current lower mean and volatility. This reduces overstocking vs using the long-run mean while keeping safety sizing based on recent variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods \u2014 use default promised lead time. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from Period 30 onward (carry-over already recorded), so avoid overreacting by pulling short-term samples; use population estimates to let OR engine compute base stock and cap. Therefore set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend uses all-sample mean/std with promised lead time=0, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand has been in the low regime that began at Period 30 (sustained ~14\u201341 per week, much lower than earlier summer peak). On-hand=53, in-transit=0 \u2014 current inventory covers multiple upcoming low-demand periods so avoid inflating forecasts. Lead time history shows consistent concluded lead_time=0; use default promised L=0. For demand, I detect a sustained regime starting Period 30 (14 periods through Period 43); I therefore use recent_N for mu_hat to reflect the lower recent mean (N=14). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to capture current volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to target a base-stock appropriate for the recent low-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given current inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently; demand dropped sharply starting Period 30 and persisted (Periods 30\u201344 show low weekly demand vs earlier high-season). I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 while smoothing short noise; same recent_N (N=12) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid unnecessary holding cost given the sustained lower demand and no evidence of delayed shipments.

To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand forecasts using the recent low-demand regime (last 16 periods, P30\u2013P45) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low demand rather than the full-history higher mean.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has been low (Periods 43\u201346: 14, 4, 6, 9) and on-hand=34 with in-transit=0 \u2014 sufficient cover for current low-demand regime. No concluded evidence of lead-time drift (historical arrivals consistently same-period), so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent low regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4 = P43\u2013P46) so mu_hat reflects current weak demand and sigma_hat uses the same recent sample to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps the base-stock small (limits holding cost) while preserving service for the observed low-demand pattern.
