{
  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed = 0 (many concluded messages show orders arriving same period). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed will arrive this period and immediately be available for demand. OR recommends 167 based on historical samples and promised L, but recent realized demand has fallen substantially since Period 25. Recent demands (P42\u2013P46) = 28,16,15,28,28 \u2192 recent 5-period average \u224823 units/week. With profit=$4 and holding=$1 the service target is high but holding is costly if we overshoot in this low-demand season. Given lead time=0 and no pipeline, I order a conservative amount near recent demand to avoid high holding cost while meeting expected sales. Order = 30 units (slightly above recent average to cover variability).",
