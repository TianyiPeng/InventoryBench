Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales show a clear upward trend over 5 samples (55,60,66,88,108) and on-hand/in-transit = 0, so we should target recent demand. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained increasing demand (uses most recent 5 weeks). Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability across all samples. This increases target base-stock to meet rising weekly demand while keeping variability estimate conservative.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: weekly mean increased from 55 (2019-01-07 start) to 108 (2019-02-04); 5-period sustained upward trend (+96% from first to last).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent 5-sample demand shows a clear upward regime (samples: 55,60,66,88,108; 5-period mean=75.4) and Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=0. On-hand and in-transit are zero. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time history (avg observed = 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the forecast on the detected upward regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). sigma_hat left as default so variability uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices provide the OR engine a demand estimate responsive to the recent upward trend while trusting observed zero lead time and avoiding over-ordering into holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): recent weekly demand shows a clear upward regime (series: 55,60,66,88,108 \u2014 sustained increase). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; prior orders arrived same-period (observed lead times = 0 in P1 and P2). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher regime (use the last 5 samples to reflect the recent upward mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to protect service level under the confirmed demand increase while the OR engine will still cap orders to control holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 for P1\u2013P3 arrivals and no lost shipments; on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Demand samples (five weeks: 55,60,66,88,108) show a sustained upward regime (5-week increase). I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (0). I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=5 = length of recent regime). These parameters steer the OR backend to increase base-stock reflecting the sustained demand rise while using observed lead time and recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has shifted up and stabilized above earlier history (recent demands: 98,162,134,111). On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs. recent demand. Concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (uses last 4 demand samples) so the base-stock reflects the current demand level; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=4 to capture current variability. These choices make the OR backend target service for the new higher mean while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand samples; using observed L=0 prevents unnecessary pipeline cover and reduces holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows all previous orders (Periods 1\u20135) arrived with lead_time=0. Demand samples (5 weeks) show a sustained upward shift ending at 108 but are limited in count. On-hand=27, in-transit=0. I use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 0). For demand I use default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (robust given small sample) and default sigma to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This keeps service level aligned with observed zero lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term spikes, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 in all observed periods. Demand has shifted to a higher regime in recent weeks (Period2-6). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 2-6 mean \u2248142.4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and keep safety stock responsive while limiting holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period. Demand has moved to a higher regime in recent weeks (Periods 3-7). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand observations: 134,111,123,182,205) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility; this focuses the base-stock on recent higher demand while avoiding overcommitment to older low-demand weeks. These parameters help the OR backend raise target stock to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in recent weeks (Periods 3-7): avg demand = 151.0 (134,111,123,182,205), ~+100% vs earlier sample mean (~75.4); sustained for 5 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals from Periods 1-8 show lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). Demand has shifted up and remained elevated in recent periods (Periods 3-8: 134,111,123,182,205,221). I set L to calculate to confirm actual lead time from observed conclues. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3-8). This raises the (1+L)-period demand estimate and captures recent variance so the OR backend increases base stock to avoid lost sales while controlling holding cost via updated sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders from Periods 1-8 arrived same period).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 5-9) = 123,182,205,221,186 (avg \u2248 183). On-hand=16, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (orders arrived same period). I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (5 most recent periods); use same recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand remains in the higher regime: last 5 observed weekly demands = [182,205,221,186,206], mean \u2248 200. On-hand=9, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (all observed arrivals same period). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime, which reduces stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1/unit. This focuses the OR base-stock on the sustained higher demand level and recent variability.

To target service while controlling holding cost, I use the average of recent high-demand periods: set L by observed average lead time, and set demand forecasts using the most recent 5-week regime for mean and volatility so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the current elevated demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows consistently zero actual lead time (orders from P1\u2013P12 concluded with lead_time=0) and a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (recent demands: 134,111,123,182,205,221,186,206,267,229). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so available stock is low vs elevated recent demand; no overdue shipments observed. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N (N=10) window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (periods 3\u201312) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility. These choices push the OR engine to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new regime while keeping holding cost informed by observed variance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals same period). On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Demand has a sustained higher regime in recent weeks; last 5 demands = [186,206,267,229,128], recent mean \u2248203.2. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind given positive on-hand inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime vs the early samples (multiple periods of 180\u2013270 and several arrivals matching same-period orders). On-hand=76, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set lead time to be estimated from observed arrivals (confirmed 0 historically) and use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility to capture the sustained higher-demand regime in the last ~10 periods so the OR engine raises the base-stock accordingly while still using observed short lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand remains in a higher regime vs early samples but shows volatility: last 5 demands (Periods 11-15) = 267,229,128,171,178 (mean \u2248194.6). On-hand=52, in-transit=0 \u2192 limited cover for upcoming demand. Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 0. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a base-stock sized to recent demand (improving service) while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use default promised L. Recent demand remains elevated versus early samples; to capture current regime I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility (captures last 8 concluded periods of demand). This biases base-stock toward higher recent demand while the OR backend cap limits extreme orders to control holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history (Periods 1\u201317) shows sustained elevated demand vs the very early samples and actual lead time has been consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201317 arrived same period). On-hand = 39, in-transit = 0. No overdue/lost shipments observed. I select default lead time to trust the promised L=0 (supported by repeated concluded arrivals). For demand and volatility I choose default (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level against holding cost by leveraging the full observed demand history and the confirmed zero lead time rather than overfitting to short recent spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 keep default L to match observed reliability. Recent demand remains elevated and variable (most recent 5 demands: 171,178,239,199,151; avg ~187.6) so forecast and volatility should use recent data to reflect current regime. Using recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current demand level and recent variance, helping the OR engine set a higher base-stock while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Demand has been in a higher, sustained regime since early periods (recent weeks average materially above early-sample mean). To reflect the confirmed zero lead time I set L using observed lead times. To capture the recent higher demand regime and its variability I use recent_N with N=10 (captures the most recent 10 demand observations to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward servicing the elevated recent demand while keeping holding costs in check given current on-hand stock and zero lead time.

To reflect the sustained higher demand and keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L=default (use promised lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 5 observations, capturing current mean and volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand elevated vs early-sample; no overdue shipments. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because actual lead time has been consistently observed as 0. For demand I bias to recent data to reflect the sustained higher regime seen in recent weeks, using the last 10 weeks to form the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR enginestocks to recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history (Periods 1-24) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and elevated, but variable, weekly demand since early periods. On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Given sustained evidence that actual lead time = 0, set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms average observed lead time (will be 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand sample set\u2014this leverages the full learned demand distribution while keeping safety stock calibrated by backend mix of profit/holding costs. This balances service level (use observed fast supplier) versus holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 172,154,120,130,86) shows a downward shift vs earlier high regime; use a recent-N forecast to capture current lower mean and reduced volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime of 5 periods). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent demand drop, reducing holding cost while preserving service given fast lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201326) repeatedly show actual lead time = 0; no overdue/lost shipments.

To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1, use promised lead time (default=0) and a recent-N forecast to capture the recent downshift. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduced volatility, which will lower base-stock targets and reduce unnecessary holding costs while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Recent demand has dropped from spring peaks; last 5 observed demands (Periods 23-27) = [120,130,86,54,56], recent mean ~89.2. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, use recent_N demand estimate (N=5) and match sigma to recent variability. Use default lead time (promised=0) since lead time confirmed as 0 in history.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26. Recent weekly demand has softened vs spring peak (last 5 demands: 130,86,54,56,59) so I use a short-window forecast to reflect current regime. Promised lead time is 0 and recent concluded history confirms same-period arrivals, so keep L as default (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level/volatility and avoid overstock from earlier high-demand weeks. This tightens orders given on-hand=60 and holding cost=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across periods 1\u201329). Recent demand has cooled from spring peaks; last 5 weeks (Periods 25\u201329) demands = 86,54,56,59,61 (avg ~63.2). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower summer regime; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 = ~63.2. Volatility likewise driven by the same 5-week window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). These parameters reduce inventory risk vs. spring peaks while preserving service for current lower-demand regime.

Recent demand has stepped down since late July (Periods 25\u201330: 86,54,56,59,61,29) \u2014 I treat the most recent lower regime as dominant. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0).

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent weekly demand has fallen from summer peaks to a lower regime: last 6 observed demands (Periods 30-35) = [29,38,28,32,37,21], avg \u2248 31.2. Historical lead time repeatedly observed = 0. To keep inventory aligned with the new lower demand regime and minimize holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): on-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in prior periods). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs spring peak; last 9 concluded weekly demands (Periods 30-38) average ~31.6 units/week, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. No overdue or missing shipments. I set L to default (promised 0, matches observed). I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime so the OR engine targets a much lower base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service. This reduces expected overstock risk given current low sales and zero in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0. Recent demand has stayed low for several periods (Periods 36-39 demands = 33,42,24,24). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I keep L at promised (default lead time=0) and set demand forecast using the most recent short regime to reflect lower recent weekly demand. Therefore: L=default; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstocking risk while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime drop starting Period 36: sustained low demand in Periods 36-39 (33,42,24,24), avg=30.75 over 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has dropped since Period 36 (periods 36-40: 33,42,24,24,22) and on-hand=71, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while covering near-term low demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (use last 5 periods), which reduces target base stock and lowers holding cost risk while preserving service for current low-demand horizon.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 36 (periods 36-41 demands = 33,42,24,24,22,18; sustained low avg \u224827). On-hand=53, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for immediate weeks. No new evidence of lead-time change (historical arrivals show lead_time=0 when shipments occurred). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because observed lead time remains 0 when shipments arrive. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using the last 6 periods (the detected changepoint window). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower demand level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 36 (periods 36-42 demands = 33,42,24,24,22,18,28; mean\u224827.6 over 7 weeks) so I use recent-data forecasting to avoid overordering. Lead time history (concluded periods) shows all observed arrivals matched same-period orders \u2192 LT=0. Chosen methods: L by 'calculate' to confirm 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=7 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining adequate service for current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Demand has shifted down starting Period 36 and remained low through Period 43; I treat this as a sustained low-demand regime and base demand forecast on the recent regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable low-demand regime from Periods 36\u201343 (regime length=8), which reduces ordering to avoid excess holding costs while preserving service level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 in concluded messages for many periods. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 36 (periods 36-44 demands: 33,42,24,24,173,24,24,22,18,28,16,15 \u2014 note Period 37 order spike caused high inventory but realized demand remained low). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. To prioritize service (profit $4 vs hold $1 \u2192 high target fill) while recognizing sustained lower demand, I set L using observed lead times (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime (use the most recent 9 demand periods of realized demand excluding the anomalous large order arrival influence). These parameters steer the backend to a base-stock sized for the low-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility, avoiding excess holdings given current on-hand stock.

Demand shows a sustained low regime beginning Period 36 (Periods 36-45: low weekly demand); I use recent_N with N=10 (regime length = 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the low recent mean/volatility and avoid excess holding given holding cost >0. This reduces base-stock and cap compared with using full-sample averages, prioritizing profit per unit while limiting ending inventory holding cost.
