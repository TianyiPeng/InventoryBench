Product: basic short-sleeve baby tee \u2014 seasonal demand somewhat higher in late winter/early spring and may get a small Valentine-related uplift. Demand analysis: historical weekly sales show a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07:55, 01-14:60, 01-21:66, 01-28:88, 02-04:108. Recent three-week average (01-21 to 02-04) = (66+88+108)/3 = 87.3 units/week; trend rising vs. earlier weeks. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time 0 but no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unknown and could be >=0; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Risk tradeoffs: holding cost = $1/unit/period (25% of $4 profit) penalizes overstock, but stockout loses profit. To balance, target coverage for the upcoming immediate demand with a small safety buffer to cover possible same-period arrivals if lead time=0 and short delays if LT=1. Order logic: forecast ~90\u2013110 units for the coming week (trend + Valentine uplift); place an order of 140 units to cover one week of expected demand plus conservative safety stock given lead-time uncertainty and rising trend.",
