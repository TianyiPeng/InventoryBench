Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 589748001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations. Historical weekly samples (5 points through 2019-02-04) show no clear changepoint or seasonality to justify deviating from defaults. To avoid overfitting and since no shipments have been observed or delayed, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average 101.6 units/week. On-hand=71, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (125) arrived same period (arrived=125, lead_time=0). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (recent observation=0). For demand parameters I use the backend defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages the full historical sample mean/variance while the OR engine uses profit vs. holding cost to set service level. Defaults are appropriate given no sustained regime change and confirmed same-period arrival in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived within the same period (observed lead_time=0 twice) and no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Demand history available (weekly samples from Jan plus recent demands of 54 and 45) shows no sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given stable lead time and no clear demand changepoint. Current on-hand covers near-term demand so aggressive uplifts are unnecessary.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand in decision-history: 54, 45, 35 (Periods 1-3). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders in P1-P3 arrived same period), so I use default promised lead time. Demand shows a recent downward regime (3 consecutive lower periods), so I set demand estimates based on the most recent 3 observations to adapt quickly. Choices: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent mean demand (~44.7); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to historical averages, lowering holding costs while preserving service for current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 avg=44.67 vs historical sample avg=101.6 (\u2248-56%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has fallen sharply vs historical sample (historic mean 101.6). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for prior orders (P1\u2013P3). On-hand=67, in-transit=0 and recent demand regime is short-lived but sustained for 3 periods (demands: 54,45,35,14). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (N chosen = regime_length=3 per rules). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the observed lower demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 (orders placed P1-P3 arrived same period), so use calculated lead time=0. Demand has dropped sharply versus historical samples and the most recent 5 periods show a lower regime (demands: 54,45,35,14,11), so I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and volatility. This keeps the base-stock aligned to the new lower demand while the OR backend will cap ordering; with profit=4 and holding=1 this favors modest service with reduced holding risk given low pipeline and no pending arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent 3-period demand (Periods 4-6 = 14, 11, 37; avg \u224820.67) is substantially below historical samples (\u2248101.6) and the earlier periods; on-hand=19, in-transit=0 so coverage is low vs even the reduced recent demand. Observed concluded lead times are 0 (Periods 1-3 arrivals had lead_time 0), so keep L=default (promised lead time). For demand I detect a sustained low-demand regime over the last 3 periods, so set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor the OR engine to the new lower mean. Volatility also appears lower but with limited data \u2014 use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce order targets versus historical levels, lowering holding cost while matching current demand signals and the confirmed short lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (orders in P1,P2,P3,P7 arrived same period), so set L to calculate (average observed lead times=0). Demand appears to have shifted down starting Period 4 and persisted through Periods 4-7; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low recent regime and avoid overstock. Chosen N=4 (regime spans Periods 4-7). This lowers the base stock to match recent demand while keeping service vs holding cost balanced given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 4 (recent demands P4-P8 = 14,11,37,13,10; mean=17). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so cover for ~1 period at recent pace. Observed concluded lead-times = 0 historically; no lost shipments. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 periods = 1*17). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock vs historical averages, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=101.6 but a sustained demand drop was detected starting Period 4 (regime length 6 periods: Periods 4-9). Actual lead time observed=0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given the lower recent demand, set L to default (promised=0), use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=6 to base (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime and reduce forecast bias from older high-demand samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen well below historical sample: last 10 periods demand sum=247 \u2192 mean=24.7. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0), so keep L=default to reflect promised same-period arrivals. To capture the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat so the OR backend sets base_stock around the (1+L)*recent mean (~24.7). Volatility also estimated from the same recent 10 samples (sigma_hat recent_N=10) to reflect current variability and avoid overstating safety stock given holding cost >0. This balances service (avoid stockouts with modest recent demand) vs holding cost (keep stock low given sustained lower demand).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (observed in Periods 1-3,7-11), so use promised lead time. A demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 4 (sustained lower demand); therefore forecast using the most recent regime. Set L to default (promised). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 4\u201311) to reflect current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR engine targets service levels appropriate for the new regime while avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent realized demand has been well below the historical sample: last 12-period mean=27.17 units/week vs historical sample mean=101.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no incoming cover. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 for all arrived orders, so use default promised lead time. Demand regime change detected at Period 4 and persisted; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the lower regime. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 0) to match observed concluded lead_time=0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 (regime from Period 4\u201312 length=9) to bias forecasts toward the sustained low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering relative to historical sample, lowering holding cost while preserving service by matching the observed lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed low from Period 4 onward: Periods 4\u201312 avg\u224827.2 vs historical sample avg=101.6 (\u2248-73%), sustained for 9 periods

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (avg \u224827.2 over P4\u2013P12; P1\u2013P3 were higher). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. All concluded lead times so far are 0. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms lead time=0 from observed conclues. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (regime from P4\u2013P13 length\u224810) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 10 periods, and sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture current low-variance regime. These choices reduce overstating demand compared to historical samples and limit holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed low-demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean (given) is 101.6 but carry-over shows a sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 onward (Periods 4\u201312 avg\u224827.2; Periods 1\u20133 avg\u224844.7). Recent concluded demands remain low through Period 14 (last 11 concluded periods show low demand). Promised lead time=0; recent concluded arrivals all show lead_time=0 so using default promised L is reasonable. To align the OR backend with the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 11 demand periods (captures the confirmed low-demand regime length = 11). This reduces forecast bias from the much larger historical sample while giving the backend demand and volatility estimates that reflect current reality, thus balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently (orders placed P1\u2013P15 all concluded with lead_time=0), so use promised/default L=0. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 4 (user carry-over insight); to capture the recent low mean I set mu_hat using recent_N=12 (Periods 4\u201315) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean over that regime. Volatility likewise uses recent_N=12 to reflect current demand variability. Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies a high service quantile (q=0.8); using recent regime stats balances service vs holding given current low demand. No overdue or lost shipments to account for.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples avg\u2248101.6 but a prolonged low regime was observed from Period 4\u201312. Recent two periods (P15=105, P16=93) show a rebound but only two high-demand observations (not yet a sustained regime change). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To remain responsive to the recent rebound while not overcommitting to a not-yet-confirmed regime shift, keep promised lead time (default) and use an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.3) to weight recent high demand more than long-run low regime. Keep sigma as default to let backend scale volatility from full sample history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10. Historical samples show a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4, but recent weeks include two large spikes (P15-16). On-hand=96, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=7 = last 7 weeks, P11\u2013P17) to capture the most relevant recent mean including recent spikes; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (high profit/holding ratio -> target high fill) while avoiding excess stock given inventory already high (96 on-hand).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 onward; on-hand=79, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0, so keep L=default. To reflect the prolonged low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility, using the regime length (Periods 4\u201318 = 15 samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 15 periods. This reduces excess ordering compared with historical pre-shift samples and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0; recent demand had a transient spike (Periods 15\u201316) but not a sustained regime change. I keep promised lead time (default) and use default demand/volatility so backend uses full-sample mean and std (conservative given mixed recent volatility) to balance service vs holding cost.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time 0 historically. I set L by calculating observed lead time to reflect evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=17) to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the sustained low regime (Periods 4\u201320), so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this down-weights the earlier high historical sample and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical and concluded data show a sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 onward; recent observed weekly demand is low and variable with occasional spikes (censored by stockouts). Promised lead time remains 0 and recent concluded arrivals confirm 0 periodically\u2014use default promised lead time to avoid overestimating L. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (N chosen as max(min(regime_length,20),3) per rules; regime_length spans many periods so 9 is a conservative recent window). Sigma uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility rather than the larger historical variance. These settings bias orders toward lower base-stock to limit holding costs while capturing recent demand behavior and short lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical shows a sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 onward, but recent 5 periods show rising demand (17,33,28,76,83) with two large spikes; spikes are not yet a 3+ period sustained shift. I keep promised lead time (L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To be responsive to recent demand without overcommitting to a permanent regime change, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean_recent and volatility from recent variability. This balances service (captures recent uptick) vs holding cost (avoids using long-term high historical mean).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (no delayed/lost shipments). Demand has experienced earlier sustained downshift (recorded in carry-over) but recent weeks show variable high draws with frequent stockouts; given reliable 0 lead time and no new sustained regime change, use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy simple and lets OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has risen vs the low regime earlier; last 5 demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [76,83,63,76,51], mean\u224869.8, showing higher summer demand and meaningful volatility. Observed lead times historically conclude as 0 periods consistently, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend sets a base-stock aligned with current weeks of demand. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost by sizing forecast and uncertainty from the latest 5 weeks. On-hand (32) is well below the recent mean demand (~70), so this will prompt replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 4 (documented in carry-over insights), so I bias forecasts to recent data rather than the full historical sample. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility, which reduces overstock risk while maintaining service. Using default L (promised 0) ensures orders arrive same period per contract; recent_N demand estimates let the OR backend set an appropriate base-stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=7, in-transit=0; last observed arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand has picked up versus the earlier low regime (recent weeks show demands ~63 avg). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use the observed lead time average and recent-demand estimates: L set to calculate (avg observed lead times = 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (last 5 concluded demands: P23\u2013P27). This balances higher recent demand against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=101.6 (from provided 5 samples). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 15: Periods 15\u201328 avg demand \u224861.7 (14 periods) vs prior low-regime avg\u224827.2 \u2014 a clear upward shift sustained >3 periods. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 in all concluded periods, so use observed lead time. I set L using recent observed lead times (calculate) to reflect actual arrivals=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the 14-period recent regime (Periods 15\u201328) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of those samples; volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N with same N to capture current variability. These choices adapt the base-stock to the renewed higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time realistic and avoiding overstock from old low-demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg increased from \u224827.2 (Periods 4\u201312) to \u224861.7 (Periods 15\u201328), +127%, sustained for 14 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed previously always arrived same period) so use promised lead time (default). Recent sustained demand regime shift detected starting Period 15 (Periods 15\u201328 avg \u224861.7, +127% vs prior low regime) \u2014 use recent_N=14 to anchor forecast to the current higher-demand regime. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on the current demand level while default lead time avoids inventing delays (no missing shipments). This balances higher service from the new regime against holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early samples mean=101.6 but carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 15\u201328 avg\u224861.7 (14 periods). All observed lead times concluded = 0. I set L to calculated (confirmed actual lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained higher post-Period-15 regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 14 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=14 to reflect volatility in that same recent regime. These choices align the OR base-stock to recent realized demand while using confirmed lead time, avoiding overstock from older high historical mean and protecting service with recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent history shows demand rose starting Period 15 and has been sustained through Period 31 (regime avg \u224861.7). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so pipeline low; shipments historically arrived same-period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I target the recent higher regime: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 15\u201331, length=17) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 17 samples. Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=17. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind by not using the long-ago larger historical mean.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; recent demand has risen (last several weeks: 98,74,75). To cover the review+lead period while reflecting the recent higher regime, use default lead time (promised=0), set mu_hat from the most recent 5 samples to capture the uptick, and set sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts with older low-demand periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 15 (avg \u224861.7) with one large spike Period 33 (142). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) demand. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so keep default L. To capture the sustained post-Period-15 regime, use recent_N over the most recent regime length (Periods 15\u201333, 19 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the current higher mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 consistently. Demand experienced a sustained increase beginning around Period 15; recent weeks remain at the higher regime. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the last ~20 weeks of demand. L set to calculate to confirm observed lead time=0. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent demand uplift while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility, balancing service vs holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 31\u201335 = 74,75,142,83,74) shows elevated mean and higher volatility vs early samples; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks (captures the post-Period-15 higher-demand regime and the recent spike). Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect increased recent volatility and avoid understating safety stock. These choices let the OR backend raise target base-stock to meet current demand while keeping holding cost in check given profit/holding ($4/$1).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows the higher-demand regime that began around Period 15 has persisted through Period 36 (avg \u224861.7/week). On-hand=31, in-transit=0 and there are no overdue/lost shipments; promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. To capture the sustained post-Period-15 regime while giving the OR engine recent data, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L) demand and volatility on the most recent ~20 periods of the elevated regime (N capped at 20 per rules). This raises the base-stock to match current demand while sigma_hat recent_N preserves observed variability, balancing service level (profit $4/unit) against $1/unit holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has returned to a higher regime since Period 15 (sustained through Period 37) with frequent weekly demand in the 70\u2013140 range; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need a replenishment-sized forecast. Promised lead time observed consistently as 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and reduce inertia from earlier low-demand periods, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (capped at 20) to weight the most recent 20 demand samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 \u2014 no evidence to change promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 29\u201338) averaged \u224893.6 units/week (10 samples) indicating the current higher-demand regime persists since Period 29. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the recent elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumption at the promised (observed) 0 to avoid unnecessary pipeline inflation.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Profit/holding gives service quantile q=0.8. Historical raw samples (early 2019) avg\u2248101.6, but carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 15: Periods 15\u201339 recent regime length \u224825 with avg \u224861.7. Use promised lead time (historically observed L=0 consistently). For demand and volatility, use recent_N based on the detected changepoint (regime length capped at 20 per rules) to capture the post-Period-15 regime: set N=20 so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 20 samples). This biases orders toward the recent higher-demand regime while keeping lead time at default to reflect consistently observed same-period arrivals. No new missing-shipment evidence to override promised lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 15 (sustained increase confirmed in carry-over). On-hand=10, in-transit=0 \u2192 low immediate cover. Historical observed lead time = 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (capture last 20 samples to reflect current seasonality and volatility). sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices push the OR backend toward a higher base stock (improving service given current high demand) while keeping volatility conservative to avoid excessive holding given $1 holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised=0). Demand has been high since the Regime shift around Period 29 (Periods 29\u201341 show elevated weekly demand vs earlier low-regime). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters using the most recent 13 concluded periods (Periods 29\u201341, regime length=13). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to current higher mean/volatility so the OR backend raises base stock and cap appropriately, improving service during this sustained higher-demand phase while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, and demand jumped to a higher regime starting at Period 15 sustained through recent history. To respond to the higher sustained demand regime while avoiding understock given zero pipeline, use recent data from the current high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent stable high-demand window; this raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and captures recent volatility to balance service level (profit-driven) versus holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 15\u201343) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs early-year lows (carry-over notes). Promised lead time=0 has been reliable (many concluded arrivals with lead_time 0). To capture the sustained elevated demand through the holiday season while avoiding costly stockouts, I use the promised lead time (default) and set demand and volatility based on the most recent 20 weeks to reflect the post-changepoint regime (Periods ~24\u201343). This increases target base stock for service during a high-demand period but keeps variability measured from recent data to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods \u2014 stick with promised lead time. Demand has risen and been volatile since the mid-year regime shift; to capture the recent elevated regime and variability I use recent_N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most recent 20 samples, which balances responsiveness to the higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes (e.g., single-week 187). This choice helps the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet higher service needs without overreacting to single outliers, and keeps holding cost in check by using a bounded recent sample.

Recent demand (Periods 41\u201345 and 39\u201345) shows elevated activity with a large spike (Period 42=187) and sustained high weekly demand (~67\u2013115 range). To capture the current, higher demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=5 (last 5 observed weeks) so the OR backend targets inventory for the near-term elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost.
