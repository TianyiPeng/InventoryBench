Target coverage: recent-period mean \u224873 units. To avoid stockout this period we need \u224873\u221255 = 18 units. Given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1 -> critical fractile ~0.80) and observed variability, I add modest safety (~12 units) to protect against upside demand. OR recommended 44 units; I trim it because current on-hand already covers most expected demand and holding cost is non-trivial. Final order = 30 units (arrives same period to meet demand but limits end-of-period inventory).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order 30 (OR=44) \u2014 lead time is 0 and recent mean demand \u224873; on-hand 55 covers most demand, so I add ~18 units to fill gap plus ~12 units safety, trimming OR to reduce holding cost.",
