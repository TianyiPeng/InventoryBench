Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent sales history shows a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 69, 88, 88). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand. Promised lead time is 0; no concluded arrivals exist to suggest a different lead time. I set L=default to use promised 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (weeks 2019-01-21 through 2019-02-04). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in this recent regime. These parameters focus the OR backend on the newly elevated mean while keeping variability calibrated to recent observations, balancing service level versus holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and higher profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior two weeks avg=0 (2019-01-07,2019-01-14) vs recent three weeks avg=81.67 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21 (recent three weeks avg \u224881.67 vs prior weeks \u22480). On-hand=23, in-transit=0 \u2192 current inventory well below recent-period demand; use recent-demand stats to avoid stockouts. Set L to promised lead time (0) confirmed by Period 1 conclude (order placed and arrived same period). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to focus on the new higher-demand regime (samples 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04 avg\u224881.67). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost awareness via OR backend's z calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. History shows two concluded orders with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2 arrivals), so actual lead time appears 0. Demand has shifted up since 2019-01-21 (earlier weeks 0 vs recent weeks much higher); to capture the recent higher regime I use recent samples to set demand forecast and volatility. I select L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint higher demand regime. Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to improve service while keeping holding cost in mind given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1280.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed lead_times=0 (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). Demand increased starting 2019-01-21 and has remained higher through recent periods (samples since 2019-01-21: 69,88,88,77,94,69). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (0). I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (6-period regime length) so the base-stock lifts to meet the new mean while sigma reflects recent volatility, balancing service level vs low holding cost (profit $19 >> holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1481.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded periods P1\u2013P4 are all 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand (concluded) = [77,94,69,79]; recent mean = 79.75 units/period. I set L via calculate to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (shift beginning 2019-01-21) and recent volatility; this focuses the base-stock calculation on current demand, avoiding stale low pre-shift samples. These parameters aim to replenish toward one-period expected demand while limiting excess holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1\u2013P4 orders arrived same period).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows sustained higher demand starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 69,88,88). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to meet the new higher regime. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand, use recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed regime (regime length=3 \u2192 N=3) so mu_hat reflects mean of last 3 samples (~81.67). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture volatility in the new regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across multiple periods) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 with elevated weekly demand since then. To capture the recent higher demand and variance, I use a recent-window forecast over the most recent 6 periods (Period1\u2013Period6) for demand mean and std. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). These choices push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while keeping holding risk accounted for via the backend's z* and cap calculations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent periods (P3\u2013P7) show a clear higher-demand regime (demands: 69,79,124,172,198) vs earlier low values; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. To capture the recent elevated demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 periods) so the base stock reflects the new higher mean across (1+L) review+lead horizon. Demand variability has also increased; use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility and give the OR engine an appropriate safety-stock estimate while the capped order will limit excess inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime (periods 5\u20138 demands: 124,172,198,309) vs earlier weeks. No overdue shipments. To capture the recent regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent 4 demand observations (regime length=4). Keep lead time at promised (default=0) since lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while the recent_N sigma captures increased variability to balance service level vs. holding cost.

To capture the recent elevated demand I set L to the observed average and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the last 6 periods P5\u2013P10) so the OR base-stock reflects current high demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 but historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime increase since 2019-01-21 with recent weekly demand high (Periods 6\u201311: 172,198,309,308,306,433). Expect current demand to remain in elevated regime; no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 weeks) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing short-term volatility; this biases base-stock upward to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N reflects observed variability to size safety stock appropriately against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all observed lead_times = 0 (consistent same-period arrivals). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since 2019-01-21 and the most recent sustained high-demand regime runs from Period 5\u201312 (8 periods). To reflect confirmed actual lead time use calculated average of observed lead times. To capture the current high-demand regime for the review+lead horizon, use recent_N over the last 8 demand samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect recent elevated mean and volatility, balancing the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since 2019-01-21 with particularly strong weekly demand in Periods 5\u201314 (~170\u2013433 units). On-hand=79, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; expect upcoming demand this period so maintain service. Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so set L via observed lead times. To capture the recent high-demand regime and its variability, use recent_N on the last 10 demand samples (Periods 5\u201314). These parameters bias the base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while the backend cap limits extreme orders; this balances high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost and avoids stockouts given no in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (earlier weeks were near zero). On-hand=108, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time and observed history show lead time = 0 consistently, so use default lead time. To avoid bias from initial near-zero weeks I use recent demand for forecasting: compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 12 demand samples to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent regime statistics rather than full-history diluted mean.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders P1\u2013P16 arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since late Jan; recent 6-week demand (Periods 11\u201316) = [433,383,322,364,346,538] and is the best indicator of current demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because observed lead time is stable at 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime and capture recent volatility so the OR backend can size base stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 14-18) shows a higher, stable regime vs the initial low samples; use a recent-N forecast to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L=default to use promised 0; set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to target current weekly demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks) and reduce stockouts; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and avoid under/over-stocking given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent weeks show sustained high weekly demand (multiple weeks 300\u2013538) after the earlier regime shift in Jan 2019. On-hand=24, in-transit=0 so current supply is low vs recent weekly demand; no overdue shipments observed (all historical concludes show lead_time=0). I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine uses all available samples (scaled by 1+L) to capture the now-higher mean and volatility; this balances service (prevent stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the base-stock using profit/holding tradeoff and the capped order policy.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has moved to a high summer regime (large spikes in last several weeks, e.g., Periods 16-20 with multiple 300-800 demands). No overdue shipments. Set L to promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand summer regime while smoothing shorter noise; this balances higher service needs (profit $19) against holding cost $1 by reflecting current elevated mean and volatility in the back-end base-stock calculation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=176, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been elevated and more volatile since spring; to reflect the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last ~3 months. Set L=default to trust promised 0 lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N N=12 to base forecast on the last 12 weeks of demand (captures recent regime without overfitting). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=186, in-transit=0; lead time historically confirmed as 0. To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks. This sets mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend targets ~1-period demand using current summer demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent weekly demand levels are high (last several weeks 436\u2013799) and on-hand=369, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 has been consistently confirmed historically, so use default L. To reflect the recent high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent data (short window N=5) so the base-stock is driven by current demand volatility rather than older zero-demand weeks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows sustained high summer demand (multiple weeks of 300\u2013800 weekly sales) and confirmed actual lead time = 0 (conclude messages P1\u2013P24). Current on-hand=75, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To let the OR engine use full historical stats and recognized zero lead time, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so base-stock is computed from all samples (captures large seasonally-elevated mean and variance). This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost by relying on backend base-stock and its 95% cap.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=260, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently; no recent lost shipments. Inventory is already high versus recent demand so I will use conservative/default forecasts to avoid excess holding cost. Choose L=default (promised lead time=0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level with the current high on-hand position.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=396, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P26) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has shifted into a sustained higher summer regime since late spring; to capture the recent higher mean and volatility I use a recent-window estimate spanning the most recent 20 periods to bias forecasts toward current summer demand while limiting noise. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflecting the current regime; L uses the default promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts in peak season) against carrying cost by increasing base stock with recent demand evidence while preserving the backend cap constraint.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). SKU 688537004 on-hand=480, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 (confirmed P1\u2013P27). Demand has been elevated through summer but no new sustained changepoint beyond the previously recorded Jan2019 shift. I choose default lead time (use promised 0), and default demand moments so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base-stock and caps. This keeps forecasting stable given no fresh, sustained regime change and avoids overfitting recent volatile weeks. High on-hand reduces urgency to inflate mu_hat now; defaults balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=489, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply since late July: weeks Period25\u201328 show low weekly demand (383,245,180,137) after a mid-July peak. Lead time has been stable and previously confirmed as 0 periods, so use default promised L. To make the OR engine responsive to the new lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 25\u201328, regime_length=4) so forecasts reflect the post-peak decline and reduce excessive replenishment/holding. This balances service (enough cover for current week) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg(P25\u2013P28)=236.25 vs avg(P17\u2013P24)=525.88 (\u221255%), sustained 4 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has downshifted since Period 25 (demands P25\u2013P29 = 383,245,180,137,133; recent avg \u2248215 vs prior much higher). On-hand = 356, in-transit = 0; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid overstock while protecting service in the new lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the last 5 periods (the detected regime). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture reduced volatility in the same recent window.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=320, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P30). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 25 (P25\u2013P30: 383,245,180,137,133,67; regime length=6). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and anchor demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current lower demand pattern. This addresses missing/late shipments (none observed) and balances profit vs holding cost given large on-hand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=305, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each observed period (confirmed P1\u2013P31), so keep promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained downward regime starting Period 25 (lower weekly demand since late July); recent 7 weeks (P25\u2013P31) best represent current demand. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand, I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts based on the current low-demand regime while keeping L=default (promised 0). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders, balancing service vs holding cost given large existing inventory and confirmed short lead time.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has dropped from summer peaks; last 4 concluded weekly demands = [133,67,69,45] (avg \u224878.5). On-hand=312, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand, no overdue shipments. Lead time historically confirmed 0; keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 4 weeks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=4 (most recent 4 weeks) to capture the new lower-demand regime (mean \u224855.75) and reduced variability; this keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving high service level (q\u22480.95).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=159, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted down since Period 25 and remained low for many weeks (Periods 28\u201335 avg \u224875.5 units); supplier lead time historically confirmed as 0. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) we maintain promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new low-demand regime. This keeps base-stock small (reduces holding cost) while preserving high service. Using recent_N=8 captures the most recent 8 weeks (Periods 28\u201335) where demand stabilized. Sigma estimated from same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=125, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand downshift starting at Period 25 (lower weekly sales P25\u2013P36). No overdue/lost shipments visible. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 12 periods (P25\u2013P36) where the new regime is evident (regime length=12). Using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the OR backend focused on the current lower mean and variance, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service for near-term demand given same-period arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=273, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (sustained lower weekly sales: P29\u2013P37 = [133,67,69,45,42,71,40,34,21] with recent weeks averaging ~48). I set L to default (promised/confirmed 0). I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the 9-week low-demand regime (Period 29\u201337) so the OR engine reduces replenishment aggressiveness and limits holding cost while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=238, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many P1\u2013P37 orders concluded with lead_time 0). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 25 (sustained lower weekly demand from P25\u2013P38). To avoid overstock while keeping service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime: compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime sample (Periods 25\u201338). This reduces expected order quantities and holding cost given current high on-hand and low in-transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 25 (P25\u2013P39 demand avg \u2248 236\u2192but recent weekly sold values much lower: P30\u2013P39 avg \u224845 units). On-hand=242, in-transit=0 so sufficient cover but we want forecasts reflecting the lower recent demand regime. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (carry-over). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (covering Periods 25\u201339) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and reduced volatility so the OR backend will lower the base-stock and cap excess ordering, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 33\u201340 mostly 42,71,40,34,21,35,35,48; recent 8-week avg \u2248 37). On-hand=221, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs recent weekly demand but holding cost is low ($1) while profit is $19 so we maintain service. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest pattern and keep orders conservative to avoid unnecessary holding. These settings give the OR backend an (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored to the most recent stable regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=196, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (weekly demands mostly ~20\u201370), and prior carry-over already confirmed lead time = 0. Inventory is sufficient for current low demand; avoid aggressive replenishment to limit holding cost. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the sustained low-demand regime: use N=13 (Periods 29\u201341) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current lower mean and observed volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=121, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled much lower than mid-year peaks (last 5 concluded demands: 35,35,48,25,75; mean\u224843.6). Historical lead time repeatedly confirmed 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L as default (promised 0) and forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the latest low-demand sample set. This reduces target base-stock to reflect the sustained downward demand and limits over-ordering given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Profit/holding implies very high service target (q\u22480.95). Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed 0; no recent lost shipments. Demand regime fell starting Period 25 and has remained lower for 19 periods (P25\u2013P43). I use default lead time (promised=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the 19-period low-demand regime to reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility, which reduces excessive ordering and holding while preserving high service level via the backend's z* calculation.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand is in a sustained low-winter regime since late summer (post-Period 25) \u2014 recent weekly demand mostly 21\u201375 units (periods 37\u201344). On-hand=208, in-transit=0, so we already hold several weeks of low-season stock. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0, so use default L. To align forecasts with the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR engine on the most recent behavior (N=8 covers the last 8 concluded weeks and satisfies the regime-length rule). This reduces target base stock compared with using the full historical mean and lowers holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=176, in-transit=0. Historical lead time consistently observed as 0 (many concluded arrivals with W=0); no recent evidence of change. Demand has been in the lower post-summer regime since Period 29 (sustained lower weekly sales). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecasts from the recent low-demand regime (most recent 17 concluded periods, P29\u2013P45) so the base-stock reflects current quieter demand and reduced variability. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the current regime and limits orders compared to full-history averages.

On-hand =161, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory coverage is ample relative to recent demand but seasonal summer peaks earlier in year are not expected now. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (use promised 0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (last 6 weeks) so the OR engine will target a lower base stock and avoid excess holding costs while preserving service for near-term demand.
