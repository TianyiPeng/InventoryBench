======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-02-11 is three days before Valentine\u2019s Day (Feb 14). The SKU is women\u2019s lingerie (high relevance for Valentine\u2019s) so short-term demand is likely to spike above baseline. b) Demand regime: historical weekly demand (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) averages ~45 units/week (samples: 42,56,47,42,42). Valentine\u2019s likely increases demand for the current week vs. that baseline. c) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals seen yet). Orders placed this decision may arrive same-period (if LT=0) or later (if LT>=1) or be lost; we must therefore balance service vs. holding risk. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. If LT>0 we cannot satisfy Period 1 demand regardless of order; if LT=0 an order can arrive in-period and meet the Valentine spike. e) Order logic: To capture elevated Valentine\u2019s demand while limiting excess holding (holding cost = profit = $1/unit/period), I place an order sized to cover approximately one week of expected demand (~45) plus a small safety buffer for the Valentine uplift. This balances upside of selling at full profit against the high per-unit holding cost.",

Treat actual lead time as 0. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead_time=0, orders arrive within the same period and can meet current-period demand. e) Order logic: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so avoid ending inventory.
