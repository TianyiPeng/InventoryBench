Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [42,56,47,42,42], mean=45.8, no observed arrivals or lead-time evidence (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). No sustained changepoint or delayed shipments detected. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs. holding cost under equal profit/holding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand: historical weekly samples (42,56,47,42,42) and Period 1 demand=63 (sold 46, stockout). No sustained regime change (only one high observation). Promised lead time is 0 and Period 1 conclude confirms a 0-period lead time (order placed P1 arrived P1). I keep L as default (promised) because observed lead time matches promised and there are no missed shipments. For demand forecast I bias toward the most recent stable samples (last 3 historical weeks: 47,42,42) to avoid over-reacting to a single high-week stockout, so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3. Volatility uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to reflect historical variability. These choices avoid overstocking after a single high-week stockout while maintaining service with the backend's capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands (Period1=63, Period2=68) are well above historical weekly mean (~45.8), but increase is only 2 periods so not yet a sustained regime change. Both concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To bias forecast toward recent high demand while remaining conservative, set L by calculating observed lead times, use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to weight recent high demands more, and keep sigma_hat as default to reflect overall historical variability. This balances service level (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded lead-times are consistently 0 (P1,P2,P3 arrived same period). On-hand=33, in-transit=0; prior periods show large replenishments and variable demand (63,68,28). No sustained demand regime change (spike then drop), so use promised/default statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all past orders (P1\u2013P4) arrived same period (lead_time=0) and demand has been variable (P1=63, P2=68, P3=28, P4=34). I set L by calculation to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time from concluded arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest four observed demands (covers the recent high then lower regime) multiplied by (1+L). sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep safety stock responsive to the recent demand pattern while leveraging confirmed short lead time to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period1, Period2 arrived Period2, Period3 arrived Period3, Period4 arrived Period4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has dropped from early spikes (P1=63,P2=68) to lower stable levels (P3=28,P4=34,P5=25). On-hand=24, in-transit=0 so current stock roughly matches one recent-week demand but pipeline is zero. I treat lead time as promised (0). For demand I detect a recent regime (lower mean) and select recent_N with N=3 (uses P3-P5: 28,34,25) to reflect the new lower demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overordering versus using the long-run mean while still covering expected next-period demand given L=0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows average \u224841.3 units/week with moderate variability; confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over). To quickly respond to observed recent demand regime I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the most recent demand pattern while L stays at default (promised lead time=0). This balances service (meet ~41/week) vs holding cost by not inflating forecasts with older data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand settled lower (~late Feb\u2013Mar): Period3-7 demands = [28,34,25,30,28], recent mean = 29.0. On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so current cover is low vs expected next-period demand (~29). Past concluded history consistently shows lead time = 0. I choose L=default to use promised (and observed) 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-spike lower regime (Periods 3\u20137) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variance. These parameters raise service for the now-lower but steady demand while avoiding overweighting the earlier high spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P8). Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138: 34,25,30,28,25) shows a sustained lower-demand regime versus earlier high spikes; current on-hand=4, in-transit=0 so coverage is low. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower-demand regime for mu_hat and matched recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding=$1/unit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period delivery (lead time = 0). Profit and holding cost are equal, so target service level is moderate. I select L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 0-period lead time. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided samples, keeping forecasts anchored to full historical demand given no sustained demand regime change. This balances fill-rate vs holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time and limited on-hand inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has trended down versus early-period highs (demands: P1=63, P2=68, P3=28, P4=34, P5=25, P6=30, P7=28, P8=25, P9=19, P10=16). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, so use promised/confirmed L=0. To capture the recent lower demand regime and reduce overstock risk, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses last 10 demand samples), which lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Historical concluded demands (Periods 1-11) average \u224832.7 units/week with moderate variability; recent weeks show no sustained regime shift. All past concluded arrivals indicate lead time = 0. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed behavior and avoid excess holding, use default lead time and default demand/statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-12) shows frequent same-period arrivals and no in-transit stock; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand samples (weekly) range ~16\u201368 with recent high of 47 in Period 12. Carry-over previously confirmed actual lead time = 0. Given stable observed lead time and no clear persistent demand regime shift (last 12 periods show variability but no sustained step-change), use default lead time and default demand stats so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on historical mean/variance and the OR engine's z* sizing.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples exhibit mean \u224845.8 units and confirmed short lead time behavior. No overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because multiple concluded periods confirm 0 lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=1, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand history shows moderate, stable weekly demand around ~46 units (historical sample mean 45.8). To keep service while avoiding extra holding cost (profit=holding), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std.

Demand in last 5 concluded periods = [24,47,28,25,42]; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent demand level and volatility while avoiding older winter samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and variable weekly demand with no sustained regime shift. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples (scaled by 1+L) for mean and sqrt(1+L) for std; this balances service level vs holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates rather than short-term noise given no strong changepoint. No overdue shipments detected in concluded history.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history appears stable around recent mean (\u224835/week). With profit=holding, target service quantile ~0.5 so aggressive safety stock not required. Use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring consistency with observed zero lead time and stable demand.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201318) consistently show actual lead time = 0. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so target service level is moderate. I therefore use default lead time (promised, which matches observed) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps decisions stable and lets the backend balance service level vs. holding cost automatically.

Prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0. No evidence of a new demand regime or delayed shipments. Use default lead time (promised = 0) so backend treats review+lead = 1 period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Historical weekly demand samples (5 values from Jan 2019) show stable baseline; recent full history (Periods 1-20) has weekly demands ranging ~16-68 with no sustained upward regime shift. On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so pipeline low; prior conclude messages confirm consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a stable base-stock reflecting long-run demand while keeping safety stock modest given profit=holding cost parity. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given current low pipeline) versus holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates and the confirmed zero lead time.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in carry-over). I choose default lead time to use promised 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical series for a stable baseline while the backend's capped ordering will limit extreme orders after the Period 22 spike.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201323 arrivals same period). Recent two periods show large demand spikes (75, 87) but this is only 2 periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Profit=Holding so critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) and base_stock equals the forecasted mean demand over review+lead. I therefore use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding without overreacting to a short two-period spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Recent three weeks show a sustained large demand spike (Periods 22-24: 75, 87, 67). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time data (all concluded arrivals show 0). To adapt to the recent regime change, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the elevated mean/volatility from the last 3 demand observations) so the OR engine raises target stock to preserve service during the spike while keeping holding costs bounded by limiting N to the shortest confirmed regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 22: avg demand increased from 31.6 (Periods 1-21) to 76.3 (Periods 22-24) (+141%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand regime shift since Period 22 (weekly demands: 75,87,67,103) -> higher mean. Lead time has been confirmed 0 repeatedly. To cover the (1+L) review+lead window while reflecting the new high-demand regime, use L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=4 to capture the elevated recent mean (~83 units/week). Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base_stock to match current demand spike while keeping holding exposure aligned to profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 periods (confirmed P1\u2013P26). Demand shifted up starting Period 22 and has remained high (Periods 22\u201326 demands = 75, 87, 67, 103, 129). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (mean of last 5 periods \u224892.2, (1+L)\xd7mean\u224892.2) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) by sizing stock to recent elevated demand while using short lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-27 arrivals matched orders same period). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 22: recent weekly demands (Periods 22-27) = [75,87,67,103,129,109], clearly higher than earlier periods. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the new high-demand regime (6-period regime length). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to capture increased volatility in the new regime. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current higher demand while reflecting recent variability, balancing service (profit) against holding cost given holding and profit are equal.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22: weekly demand rose from ~31.6 (P1-21) to much higher levels (P22-28: 75,87,67,103,129,109,113). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1\u2013P28). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast/uncertainty on the 7-week post-change regime (Periods 22\u201328). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while reflecting recent volatility, and avoids over-weighting older low-demand data; default lead time trusts confirmed arrivals and prevents unnecessary safety stock for phantom delays.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P29). Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (Periods 22\u201329 large increases vs Periods 1\u201321). On-hand=24, in-transit=0; recent weeks (22\u201329) should drive forecast. Set L to default (promised lead time 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 8 demand samples, Periods 22\u201329). This focuses base_stock on the elevated recent mean and scales safety by recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost. No indication of missing shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1-30). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 22 (Periods 22-30 demands: 75,87,67,103,129,109,113,74,92; regime length=9). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and variability from Periods 22\u201330. This increases replenishment targets to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand period while the 0 confirmed lead time minimizes pipeline safety stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 (higher weekly demand). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient to cover a high-demand week if elevated demand persists. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods, so keep promised lead time. To capture the new higher demand level and recent volatility, set demand forecast using the most recent 10 weeks (Periods 22-31). This biases the base-stock to the elevated regime and reduces stockouts while the holding cost equals profit (balanced service vs holding). No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 (avg rose substantially and persisted through recent periods). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior insight. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters using the post-changepoint window (Periods 22-32, length=11). Choices: L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time=0; mu_hat=recent_N N=11 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean over the 11-period high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N N=11 to reflect volatility in that same regime. This prioritizes service during the sustained higher-demand period while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding cost.

Demand shifted up starting Period 22 (previous avg 31.6 \u2192 76.3 for P22-24) and high demand persisted through recent periods. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and compute demand parameters from the recent regime: use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 22\u201333) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the sustained higher mean and volatility. No overdue/lost shipments to adjust for.

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 (higher weekly demand since then). I set L=default to use the promised (and observed) 0-period lead time. To capture the post-changepoint demand level, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 22\u201334, length=13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent higher-demand samples. This tightens responsiveness to the sustained higher demand while keeping holding risk controlled given profit=holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 22 (weekly demands much larger than Periods 1-21). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=0) and base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the last 14 weeks (Periods 22-35) which captures the new higher mean and volatility while meeting the rule for recent_N (N equals regime length). This raises the base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the higher demand, improving service while avoiding unnecessary extra safety from older low-demand data.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been well above early-period levels since the confirmed regime shift starting Period 22 (sustained high demand through Periods 22-36). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover current + lead demand. Promised lead time has been historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=0). I select L=default to use promised 0. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=15 (recent 15 weeks) so the OR backend bases base_stock on the recent high-demand regime and recent volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 22 (avg jumped from ~31.6 to ~76.3) that persists through Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must plan to cover current period demand plus lead+review. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-37). I therefore use default lead time (promised). For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N over the most recent regime since Period 22 to reflect the new mean/volatility. Regime length ~16 periods (P22\u2013P37) \u2192 N=16. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR estimator on the elevated demand, raising the base-stock and safety stock to reduce lost sales while the holding cost equals profit so service is prioritized but not excessively. This balances service vs holding given current zero inventory and confirmed higher demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 22 (higher demand through current period). I set L by calculating from observed lead times to reflect the confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 22\u201338 form the new high-demand regime; regime_length=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's (1+L) scaling uses the current regime mean/volatility and balances service level vs holding cost under the new, higher demand pattern. This addresses missing shipments (none observed recently) and avoids diluting the forecast with pre-shift low-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201339 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 22 (sustained); recent weeks show large and volatile demand (Periods 35\u201339 demand: 86,110,149,183,131). To capture the elevated recent demand while keeping responsiveness (lead time 0), I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the most recent five demand observations, reflecting the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. L set to default to keep promised lead time (0) since conclues consistently confirm same-period arrivals. This balances service level (by sizing to recent high mean) against holding cost (uses short window rather than all-time mean).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; no shipments currently pending. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many periods), so set L via calculate (avg observed = 0). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 22 (higher demand through Period 40). To capture the post-shift regime I use recent_N for demand and variability using the last 19 periods (Periods 22\u201340, regime length = 19) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 19 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 19 samples). This balances higher recent demand (avoids understock) while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the confirmed higher-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 22 (avg rose markedly). To respond to the higher recent demand and no pipeline, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and estimate demand using the most recent regime: recent_N with N=20 (Periods 22-41) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock reflecting the higher recent mean and volatility. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) while letting the backend cap limit orders to control holding cost exposure.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (Periods 1-42 arrivals same-day). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 22 (avg ~76 vs ~31 before); recent weeks (Periods 23-42) show elevated and variable weekly demand with several large peaks in Oct\u2013Nov. I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-regime higher mean and recent volatility over the last ~20 weeks (covers the sustained higher-demand regime) so the OR backend raises base stock to protect service while limiting excess holding. Sigma uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent higher variability rather than long-ago low-variance data. No missing shipments to account for.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent since Period1). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period22 (noted previously) \u2014 recent weeks remain at elevated levels (Periods 39-43 demands: 131,126,183,66,66 with prior weeks also high). To keep service during this higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast and volatility based on recent data. I choose recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained, higher-demand regime (captures last ~20 weeks) so the OR engine raises base-stock appropriately without overreacting to single-week spikes.

Demand shifted up starting Period 22 and has remained elevated; use recent data to reflect the new regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent elevated-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand data. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This increases the base-stock to meet higher demand while the recent-N volatility keeps safety stock appropriate given holding cost = profit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (Periods 1-46 concludes show arrivals same period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 22 (carry-over): higher demand since then; use recent data to capture the new mean/volatility. I select L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent regime while capping at 20) so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> neutral service level). Current on-hand (65) provides buffer for expected near-term demand but recent_N tuning raises target base stock to match elevated demand.
