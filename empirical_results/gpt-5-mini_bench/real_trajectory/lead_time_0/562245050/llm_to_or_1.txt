Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 562245050 (women's skinny jeans). Historical weekly demand samples: [97,57,65,61,55], mean=67.0, sd\u224815.5. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence to override it. Profit/holding ratio implies a high service target (q\u22480.95) which the OR backend will encode. Use default estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, ensuring coverage of the current period's demand without overcommitting inventory given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). SKU 562245050 has on-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand mean=67 (samples: 97,57,65,61,55). Promised lead time=0 and last period's conclude shows an on-time arrival for Period 1, so no strong evidence of lead-time shift or demand regime change. Using default methods (promised L and population stats) yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover current period demand and sigma_hat based on historical variability; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to one period's data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent realized demands: Period1=45, Period2=77; historical weekly mean from Jan samples ~67. On-hand=16, in-transit=0; two recent orders both arrived same period. Observed lead times both 0 \u2192 confirm using default/calculate lead time = 0 is appropriate. No sustained demand regime shift detected; use default demand estimates so OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=\u221a(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to two-week volatility and accounts for confirmed same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period1, Period2 order arrived in Period2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1786.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (97,57,65,61,55) give mean=67. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes (orders arrived same period). No sustained demand regime shift (single high demand period is not 3+ periods), so use default demand estimates to avoid overfitting to noise. Default choices keep (1+L)*mean and volatility based on all samples, while using promised lead time=0 preserves fast replenishment behavior and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples mean=67 units (samples: 97,57,65,61,55). Recent concludes show same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0). To cover current-period demand and align with observed lead time, set L to observed-average. Use mu_hat default so backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples = 67 units forecast for review+lead period. Use sigma_hat default to reflect historical variability. These parameters balance service (cover ~67 expected weekly demand) versus holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed in Period 3 and subsequent periods), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, and recent weeks have had high demand spikes (weeks with 124\u2013134). I choose to trust promised lead time (0) and use default demand estimates based on all historical samples to let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost. This keeps ordering responsive to observed zero lead time while avoiding overcommitting to higher explicit forecasts given limited sample history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demands show a clear upward regime starting Period 3: recent demands (Periods 3-6) = [134,124,134,141], prior sample mean (Jan) = 67. Lead time has consistently been same-period (0) in concluded history. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to ensure backend uses confirmed 0. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (4 consecutive high-demand periods). This increases replenishment targets to meet elevated demand while keeping sigma estimated from the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices balance higher service level (avoid stockouts after several lost-sales weeks) vs holding cost by relying on recent actual demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg increased from 67 (Jan samples) to 133.25 (Periods 3-6), +99% sustained over 4 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (higher mean through Periods 3\u20137). To protect service level while minimizing holding cost, I keep L at promised (default=0) and set demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (last 5 weeks, Periods 3\u20137) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock sized for the new regime rather than diluted by older low-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time confirmed as 0 (orders in P1-P8 arrived same period) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (higher mean sustained through Periods 3-8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover (1+L) periods. I keep L as default (promised lead time 0, consistent with concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 3-8) to capture the new, higher-demand regime rather than diluting with the low Jan samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect the observed volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to maintain service during the sustained elevated demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3527.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand elevated since Period 3 (carry-over: sustained +99% regime). On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so we have limited coverage for coming demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default L=0. For demand forecast use recent regime data: apply recent_N with N=7 (Periods 3\u20139) to capture the sustained higher mean rather than the older low-Jan samples. Use same recent_N N=7 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings produce a base_stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding reliance on stale low-demand samples, balancing service-level (profit $19) and holding cost ($1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained increase to ~133/week). On-hand=26, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time observations (Periods 1-10 conclude) consistently show 0 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=8 (Periods 3-10) so the base-stock reflects the new mean/volatility while keeping promised lead time (0). This balances service (avoid stockouts in the higher regime) against holding cost by limiting lookback to the confirmed regime rather than all historical low-demand weeks.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained ~133+ weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the immediate review+lead window. Lead time confirmed earlier as 0 \u2014 use promised/default. For demand forecast use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201311, 9 samples) so mu_hat reflects current mean\xd7(1+L). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture current volatility. This balances service (cover elevated demand) vs holding cost by targeting the recent elevated mean and its observed variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (Periods 3\u201312 elevated vs. Jan samples). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (regime spans Periods 3\u201312) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the 10 most relevant samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=10 to capture recent volatility. These settings keep the base-stock tuned to the new, higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead-time=0 to avoid unnecessary safety stock for longer lead times.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=119, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across periods). Demand shifted up at Period 3 and has been consistently higher through Period 13 (periods 3\u201313, 11 samples). To capture the new regime I set L to the observed average lead time and use recent_N=11 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and keep service while controlling holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Demand regime shift was detected at Period 3 and persisted; recent demand remains elevated and variable. I set L to default (promised 0) given confirmed 0 LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime (use last 12 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned to the ongoing higher-demand regime while using recent variability so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost.

Demand regime shifted upward starting Period 3 and has remained elevated through Period 15 (regime length = 13 periods). To reflect the sustained higher demand I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed), and use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 13 demand samples, capturing the new higher-demand regime and preserving service while controlling holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3 (weekly demands mostly ~140\u2013265, recent weeks 189\u2013237). On-hand=18, in-transit=0 so current availability is very low vs. realized weekly demand (~200). Use promised lead time (0) since lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the sustained post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 14 samples to reflect current weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N with same N to reflect recent demand variability. These choices push the OR backend to target a higher base stock appropriate for the new regime while using recent variance to size safety stock and limit excess holding given holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10. On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=0. Recent demand (Periods 12-17 = 206,145,189,199,237,187) shows a sustained higher regime vs the Jan baseline; to capture current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N over the last 6 observed demands for both forecast mean and std. This provides (1+L)-period demand driven by current regime, improving service while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost $1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in concluded history). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 3 (noted in history and persists through recent periods). To capture the elevated demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to weight recent high-demand regime; selected N=10 to cover the recent sustained high-demand window while avoiding excessive noise. These parameters tilt base-stock upward to improve service (profit $19 vs holding $1) while sigma_hat recent_N controls safety stock sizing to limit excessive holding.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 3 (regime shift confirmed earlier) and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand=42, in-transit=0 so there is no pipeline cover for upcoming demand. I set L to calculate to lock in observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher sustained mean/volatility: N=17 (Periods 3\u201319 inclusive). This gives mu_hat that reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand regime and sigma_hat reflecting recent volatility, which balances service (avoid stockouts in the new regime) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=120, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluces show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (higher mean since then). Use promised lead time (default L=0 because observed lead times consistently 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u201320) so mu_hat reflects the higher sustained mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These settings balance higher service needs from the sustained demand increase while keeping holding cost visible to the optimizer.

On-hand=135, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed by concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and capture current mean demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding exposure aligned to recent variability and current on-hand.

Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 3 (higher weekly sales vs Jan samples). No overdue or missing shipments to account for. I select default lead time to trust the promised/observed 0-period behavior. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the full historical samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping calculations robust. This balances service level (captures higher mean demand) against holding cost (backend uses profit vs holding to set safety stock).

Use a short recent window to capture current regime while keeping safety low given low holding cost (H=$1) vs profit ($19). L set to promised/default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current demand level and recent volatility, ensuring base-stock targets respond to the recent downshift and avoid excess holding.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weeks show stable demand after the sustained higher regime that began in Period 3; current on-hand=98, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments visible. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. I select L=default to let the backend use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast and volatility I choose default methods so the backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which leverages the full history (including the sustained higher-demand regime) and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=173, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period1\u20137 evidence). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 3 (avg rose ~67 \u2192 ~133 and persisted); recent history (Periods 6\u201325) supports using recent-demand statistics rather than the small Jan sample set. To keep high service with low holding cost given profit=$19 and hold=$1, I use promised/confirmed lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime using recent_N with N=20 (caps per rules) so the OR backend computes base stock tuned to the elevated, sustained demand while capturing recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=202, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3 (avg roughly doubled and persisted through following periods). To reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N on demand stats, drawing on the most recent 20 periods of data (captures the post-changepoint regime). Keep L as default (confirmed 0) so arrivals remain same-period per history; sigma also recent_N with N=20 to reflect volatility of the current regime. This raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts under higher demand while the profit-to-holding ratio (profit=$19 vs holding=$1) justifies higher service levels.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=192, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Demand regime shift detected in early periods (sustained higher mean since Period 3). To respect the confirmed zero lead time and recent higher-demand regime, set L using calculated observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (use last 20 periods of demand to capture current mean/volatility). This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding costs given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=188, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over). Demand has declined from the high regime (Periods 3-11) and the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 22-28: 90,128,119,74,56,71,73) better represent current demand. To keep service high while limiting holding cost given large on-hand, keep L as default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock using the immediate recent demand mean and volatility rather than the long-run mean which is inflated by earlier high regime demand.

Demand has declined since the mid-year peak; latest 6 periods (P25\u2013P30) show a sustained lower-demand regime (demands: 74,56,71,73,63,70; avg \u224868). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates based on the recent low-demand regime (last 6 samples) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend lowers target base-stock accordingly.

Demand has returned to a lower recent level (Periods 27-31 demands = 71,73,63,70,52; recent mean ~65.8). To match current demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast for demand (N=5) and recent volatility (N=5). Lead time set by calculation (average observed lead times = 0). This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while preserving service given same-period arrivals.

Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201332), and there are no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has moderated (last 4 concluded demands: 63,70,52,47) but this does not yet constitute a new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with observed arrivals. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, which balances service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and no new strong evidence to re-weight recent data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). On-hand=154, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent 7-week demand (Periods 29-35) averaged ~54 units/week, a sustained decline vs earlier high-demand regime. To be responsive to this recent lower demand while still covering the review+lead period, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to base the base-stock on the most recent sustained regime. Use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This reduces excess holding while preserving service given current lower demand and zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg demand decreased from 133.25 (previous high regime) to 54.14 (Periods 29-35), -59% sustained over 7 periods

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 29 (avg ~54.14 over P29-35) and recent concludes show continuing low weekly demand (P31-36: 52,47,69,47,31,40). On-hand=114, in-transit=0; no shipments concluded in P35-36 so pipeline is empty. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period), so use promised/confirmed 0. To keep inventory aligned with the sustained lower-demand regime, set L=default (promised 0) and estimate demand using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstock. Chosen N=8 covers Periods 29-36 (the detected low regime). sigma_hat also set recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the lower demand and limit holding cost while preserving service given current confirmed lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent confirmed regime: demand has been low since Period 29 (avg ~51 units/week over P29-37). On-hand=72, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To match the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N forecasting (N=9, P29\u2013P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes replenishment to the current low-demand mean and observed variability rather than older high-demand periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent, shipments arrived same period). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (Periods 29-35 average \u224854.14, -59% vs prior high). I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history supports it. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 (the confirmed low-demand regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 demand samples (Periods 29-35) to reflect the sustained lower demand. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture volatility in the same recent low regime. These choices reduce excess stocking from previous high-demand era while preserving service given confirmed short lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals matching same-period orders). A sustained demand decline began at Period 29 (Periods 29-39 average demand \u224849.6 over 11 weeks); I therefore forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce excess holding while maintaining service.

Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 29 (recent weeks avg ~50s). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set lead time using observed average, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the low-demand regime (last 12 weeks) so the OR engine targets stocking for current lower demand and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Recent demand has been lower since the drop identified earlier (Periods 29-35); last 7 concluded demands (Periods 35-41) average ~40 units/week and show lower variance. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so we should size replenishment to cover the short (1+L) review+lead window using recent demand to avoid excess holding cost. I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime so the OR backend computes a smaller base stock and tighter cap, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-42) consistently show orders arriving same period => actual lead time confirmed 0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 29 (carry-over insight) with recent observed demands (Periods 36-42 = 40,42,39,46,59,26,130) \u2014 recent window captures current variability including the large censored spike in Period 42. To keep the OR backend responsive to the current low-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility, set L to default (use promised lead time 0), use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the most recent week-level regime), and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time of 0 (multiple periods). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (carry-over insight: Period29\u201335 avg ~54.14) with continued moderate weekly demand in Periods 36\u201343 (demands: 40,42,39,46,59,26,130*,30; P42 spike=130 was a stockout-driven surge). To react to the sustained lower-demand regime and recent variability while preserving service, set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8, covering Periods 36\u201343) so the forecast reflects the recent lower regime and recent variability, avoiding overweighting older high-demand months. This reduces excessive holding cost while keeping availability for typical weekly demand. *Noting the P42 spike as likely stockout-driven; recent_N will dilute its effect but keep some responsiveness.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Periods 1\u201344). No new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over insights; recent high-demand weeks (e.g., P42) appear one-off. To keep behavior stable and let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moment estimates so backend computes base-stock from all samples. This also avoids overreacting to single-week spikes and balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while keeping holding low. No evidence of missing shipments requiring explicit lead-time inflation.

Current on-hand=182, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample versus recent weekly demand.

To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default), and estimate demand using a short recent window (N=5) to capture the current lower regime while smoothing the one spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=163, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in Period 3). Recent demand has downshifted from earlier high regime; last 5 demands (Periods 42-46) = [130,30,37,36,19], average ~52.4 \u2014 includes one holiday spike (130) but otherwise low demand. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining a high service target (profit/ (profit+holding)=19/20=0.95), use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimate from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the post-spike lower regime. Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock to current low-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility spike.
