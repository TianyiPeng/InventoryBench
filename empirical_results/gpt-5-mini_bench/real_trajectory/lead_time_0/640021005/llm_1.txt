Demand regime: recent shift upward vs early Jan; short-run expectation ~17 units this period. Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unobserved; no concluded arrivals to confirm. Risk tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period \u2014 holding inventory beyond the period erodes reward, so avoid ending inventory. Order policy: target expected demand for current period (~17) so arrivals (if LT=0) satisfy demand without creating significant ending inventory if demand materializes. If actual lead time >0 this order will not arrive this period; that risk must be resolved by observing period conclude messages in following periods.",
