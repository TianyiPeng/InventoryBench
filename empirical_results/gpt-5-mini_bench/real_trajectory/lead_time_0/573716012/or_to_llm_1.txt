OR recommends 91 (uses promised L=0 and historical demand); with profit = holding cost the critical fractile q=0.5 so OR's base-stock \u2248 mean demand. Given on-hand (116) already exceeds OR's suggested stocking (91) and there is no in-transit replenishment, placing additional units only increases holding cost without improving expected profit (profit per sold unit equals holding cost per unsold unit). Demand has been volatile (recent spikes P42=431, P43=250, P44=34) but no sustained new regime since P44 was low; per carry-over rules I will not record a new regime. Therefore order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost while meeting likely single-period demand as much as possible from on-hand inventory.",

Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover Period 46 demand out of a new order. Demand analysis: recent demand is highly volatile but shows strong Dec spikes: Periods 42\u201345 demands = [431,250,34,239]; the three high weeks (P42,P43,P45) average 306.7. The OR baseline (208) uses long-run history and promised L but smooths volatility; given current Christmas-week spike risk I want more buffer. Service/holding tradeoff: profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5 (no theoretical safety stock), but given asymmetric cost of stockouts during peak shopping week and immediate arrivals (L=0), I add conservative safety. Decision: order 300 units \u2014 this exceeds OR's 208 to cover likely elevated demand this week (targeting between recent high-week average ~307 and OR's recommendation), while limiting excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.
