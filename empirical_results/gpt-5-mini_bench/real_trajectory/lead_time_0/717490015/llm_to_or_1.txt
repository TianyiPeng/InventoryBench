Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 717490015 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and only the provided historical weekly samples (5 weeks). Promised lead time is 0 and no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. To be conservative and let the OR engine use available history, I select default lead time and default demand estimates (use all samples). This keeps the backend formulaic base-stock calculation consistent with observed data and balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (weeks 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 44 units/week. Period 1 order (53) arrived same period (lead_time observed=0). Current on-hand=12, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use L=default (promised 0) because observed lead time so far =0 and no evidence of delays. I use mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean from all samples (1\xd744=44) reflecting typical weekly demand. I use sigma_hat=default so backend uses all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (covering expected demand this period) while avoiding excess holding cost given modest holding penalty relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~44; two recent concludes show demand 41 (P1) and a single high week 73 (P2) \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. Observed lead times for two past orders were 0 periods. No evidence of lost shipments. To keep the OR engine's baseline forecast and avoid overreacting to one high week, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level vs. holding cost given limited evidence of change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (lead_time=0 each), and recent sales were high (sold 41,52,60 in P1-P3). Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time appears stable at 0. Use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) which captures the historical weekly demand samples and scales for lead+review period. This balances a high service level (profit/holding implies q=0.8) while keeping holding costs reasonable given current zero inventory and confirmed short lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders from Periods 1-3 arrived same period)

Daily Profit: $200.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4) = [41,73,82,50], recent mean = 61.5 vs older sample mean (~44) \u2014 evidence of a sustained upward regime over the last 4 periods. On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history confirms timely arrivals, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime_length=4 -> N=4). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to improve service without excessive hold given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4 (q=0.8 favors fill rate).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (last 5 periods): 41,73,82,50,50 \u2014 recent mean (5) is materially higher and more variable than older Jan samples. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std, keeping the policy responsive to the last 5 weeks of demand and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last 6 concluded demands = [41,73,82,50,50,76], mean=62.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and prior periods confirm actual lead time = 0, so any order placed will arrive within the same period. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (all 0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current higher-demand regime (covers review+lead period = 1 week) and captures recent volatility; this balances service level against $1 holding cost given $4 profit per unit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals and demand variability around mean ~44/week from historical samples. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to rely on promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (leveraging the five historical weekly samples mean=44) to balance service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0). Current on-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical weekly demand samples mean=44 units (samples: 54,36,43,32,55). I select L=default to reflect confirmed promised/observed lead time 0. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L); this balances service (using long-run mean=44) against holding cost given frequent same-period replenishment and small on-hand inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand average ~65 units (Periods 1\u20139 mean=65.33); on-hand=17, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Prior concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 0. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean and std (conservative, stable regime). This balances service (meet ~1-week demand) vs holding cost given moderate demand variability and current modest on-hand inventory.

Given small on-hand and immediate arrivals historically, use default estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full sample history to set base-stock and the capped order cap. Defaults balance service level (via backend profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding overfitting to short recent swings. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or delayed shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-11) is significantly higher than the early Jan sample set. Historical Jan samples mean=44 units/week; Periods 1-11 mean=67 units/week, suggesting a sustained demand regime shift. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (consistent across multiple periods). To protect service with minimal holding cost, I set L using observed lead times, and base demand estimates on the recent regime (last 11 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=11 to reflect the current higher mean and variance so the OR backend's base-stock and cap compute appropriate order quantities given promised L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Jan samples avg=44 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) -> recent Periods1-11 avg=67 (+52%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (orders in P1..P11 arrived same period).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals P1..P12 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and sustained higher demand since Periods 1..11 (recent regime avg \u224868 vs Jan avg \u224844). No overdue/lost shipments visible. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by concluded history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses all observed demand samples (1+L times mean and sqrt(1+L) times std) to capture the recent higher-demand regime while keeping parameters robust to variability. This balances service level (meeting current ~68 units demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201313), so keep L=default (promised=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime vs Jan: recent periods (P9\u2013P13) demands = [57,67,82,80,26], recent mean ~62.4 which better reflects current demand than the Jan samples. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime while keeping responsiveness to the drop in P13. This balances service level (use recent demand mean across review+lead) against holding cost by avoiding overstating demand from older data. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1..P14) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2192 lead time confirmed 0. Demand has been higher than the Jan baseline (carry-over note: recent regime avg \u224867 vs Jan avg \u224844). To capture the recent elevated demand I use recent_N methods based on the most recent 11 demand samples to estimate the review+lead demand and volatility; keeping L at default (promised) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. This raises mu_hat to match the current regime and uses recent sigma_hat to reflect recent variability, helping the OR backend set a higher base-stock (improving service) while sigma reflects risk to avoid excess holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 through Period 15) and a demand regime shift noted at Period 12. On-hand=8, in-transit=0; recent demand is volatile with last 4 periods (P12\u2013P15) = [80,26,40,72], suggesting a lower short-run mean than the earlier high regime but higher than the January baseline. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concludes consistently confirm 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent regime (N chosen = max(min(regime_length=4,20),3)=4). This focuses the base-stock on the current observed mean/volatility to balance service (capture recent spikes) vs. holding cost given low on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (Periods 1\u201316). Demand shifted upward around Period 12; recent regime (Periods 12\u201316) is shorter but clearly different from Jan baseline. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 concluded periods: P12\u2013P16) to capture the post-shift regime when forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This biases the base-stock toward current higher demand while keeping safety stock responsive. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility post-shift, helping the backend balance service (profit vs holding cost).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes P1\u2013P17 consistently show arrived=ordered same period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand history shows higher recent mean since Period 12 (carry-over), but no new sustained changepoints since Period 12. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and use full-sample demand statistics the backend expects, I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so base-stock uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This ensures the backend computes safety stock from full history while reflecting confirmed 0 lead time; with on-hand=33 and no pipeline, orders will be sized by the engine to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Demand regime increased around Period 12 (recent periods average ~67 vs Jan avg ~44). To reflect the confirmed zero lead time and recent higher demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the replenishment on the most recent regime (Periods 8-18 roughly), capturing current mean and volatility while avoiding stale January samples. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given current on-hand stock and no pipeline.

A demand regime shift was recorded at Period 12 (higher mean vs Jan); no new sustained change since (the large demand in Period 21 appears as a single spike). To capture the post-change regime I use recent_N=11 for demand mean and volatility (uses the most recent 11 samples to reflect the elevated regime and recent variability). These parameters help the OR backend set a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under confirmed zero lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 repeatedly through Period 22. Recent demand has spiked starting Period 21 (demands: P18..P22 = 37,63,61,151,187). To react to the apparent higher recent demand while keeping sensitivity to volatility, I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 5 periods (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. This raises the base_stock to cover the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat (recent_N) lets the OR engine account for increased variability and cap limits order size.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed through Period 23 concludes). Demand shows a new sustained spike in Periods 21-23 (151,187,150). To capture the new high-demand regime while keeping lead-time as promised, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the three most recent high-demand weeks, ensuring the base-stock target and cap reflect the elevated demand and limit stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: recent Periods21-23 avg=162.67 vs prior Periods1-20 avg=60.95 (+167%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1..P23 arrivals same period).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 21 (large July spike) with concluded arrivals always same-period. On-hand=52, in-transit=0; upcoming demand likely remains elevated (weeks 21-24 avg demand \u2248154). Use lead time = promised (confirmed actual LT=0 in concluded history). For demand forecast use recent_N on last 4 samples (Periods 21-24) to capture the new high-demand regime (N=4 reflects regime length and meets N>=3). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the elevated July demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 periods repeatedly (orders from P1..P25 arrived same period). Demand regime shifted up around P21\u2013P24 (sustained higher weekly demand). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent 5 periods (P21\u2013P25) where the new regime is present. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. This raises target base-stock to protect service while sigma from recent data controls safety-stock to limit holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 0 (orders in P1..P26 all arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 21 (P21..P26 demands = 151,187,150,129,80,82) \u2014 recent demand is clearly above early-period Jan baseline. Given the confirmed same-period arrivals, I keep L = promised (0) but use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime. I select recent_N with N=6 (Periods 21\u201326) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock to match the higher recent mean while accounting for recent volatility. This balances the high service level implied by profit/holding (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) against inventory costs by using recent demand stats rather than the long-run mean.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in P1..P27 arrived same period). Demand peaked in late June/July (P21-P24) then declined; last 3 concluded demands (P25-P27) average ~78. To avoid overstock from the transient peak, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent short regime (last 3 periods) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock aligned with current demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand drop confirmed at Period 25-27: avg=78.0 (P25-P27) vs prior spike avg=162.67 (P21-P23), change \u221252%; lead time remains 0 (orders P1..P27 arrived same period).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent lead time = 0 (orders in P1..P28 arrived same period). Recent demand has returned from July spike to ~post-peak levels (P25-P27 avg ~78) and P28 demand=67; no sustained new regime detected. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no fresh changepoint, use default calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting stable, leverages full history, and lets the backend balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost via its quantile rule.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand: sharp summer peak (P21-P24) then decline since P25. Last 5 demands (P25-P29) = [80,82,72,67,57], recent mean ~71.6. On-hand=45, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 0) to reflect stable confirmed same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-peak lower-demand regime (protecting against overordering from the earlier spike while covering (1+L) periods). This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0; no missing shipments. Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 82,72,67,57,38) indicates a post-peak moderate regime (~63 units/week). To target service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 weeks so mu_hat reflects current lower post-spike demand and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. L uses promised/observed 0 lead time.

On-hand=33, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically confirmed 0). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I set lead time to default (promised 0, historically confirmed) and set demand estimates using the most recent 3-week regime (recent_N N=3) so the base-stock reflects the current lower demand and reduced volatility. Using recent_N for sigma matches the same short window so safety stock responds to current variability rather than the mid-summer spike.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) through Period 32. Recent demand has settled down after the mid-summer spike: last 8 concluded demands (P25-P32) = 80,82,72,67,57,38,45,34 (avg=59.625) \u2014 this reflects the post-peak regime more than the earlier spike. Given high profit vs holding (service target q=0.8) I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current lower regime while keeping safety stock. Set L to promised (default) since lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime; this keeps orders aligned with current demand and avoids overstock from the earlier spike.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows repeated same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 across many periods) and demand has settled to mid-range weekly values (recent demands P29-P33: 57,38,45,34,67; ending on-hand=9, in-transit=0). No evidence of new sustained demand regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps target base-stock responsive to observed variability while avoiding overreacting to short fluctuations and addresses the lack of in-transit stock by letting the optimizer order to the computed base-stock.

I set L to default (promised 0) because lead time has been confirmed repeatedly. To adapt to the recent lower demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses the forecast and variability on the last 5 weeks (Periods 30-34) rather than the full-sample mean that is inflated by the July spike. This reduces overordering and holding cost while preserving service given current demand patterns.

Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (many concluded arrivals same period). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures post-peak lower demand and reduces over-ordering given holding cost).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period) and a demand regime that peaked in Jul then dropped; recent weeks (Periods 30-36) show lower demand (~30-45/week). No evidence of lost shipments. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, I use promised lead time (default L=0), forecast demand from the recent regime using recent_N to capture current lower weekly demand (N=7 chosen to cover the last ~7 observed weeks), and keep sigma as default to let backend use full historical volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). SKU 717490015 on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) with no recent lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 34-37) is moderate (22,29,30,34) and shows no sustained regime shift. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed 0), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (maintain availability given steady demand) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (confirmed LT=0 in prior periods). Recent demand has fallen from summer peak; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34-38) = [22,29,30,34,16], indicating a lower recent mean. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since arrivals have been reliable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the OR forecast on the latest lower-demand regime (reduces starting base_stock and caps holding costs given current high on-hand). This balances service (covers current period + lead) while avoiding excess holding cost given slow recent sales.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): recent sales have been low (last concluded demand=17) but historical Jan baseline and multiple confirmed past regime shifts indicate no new sustained change yet. On-hand=62, in-transit=0 (no arrivals pending). Lead time has consistently been observed as 0 periods in concluded history. To avoid overreacting to a short low-demand run while preserving service, use promised lead time and the default demand statistics (which anchor to the historical samples). This balances profit-driven service level vs holding cost by relying on established demand estimates rather than short-term noise.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been low after the summer spike: last 7 concluded weekly demands (Periods 34-40) = [22,29,30,34,16,17,14], recent mean \u2248 24 units/week which is the best short-term forecast. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep inventory lean (holding cost $1 vs profit $4), I use a short-window recent estimate to align base-stock with current low demand and lower volatility estimate from same window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has fallen and been persistently low since Period 35 (demands P35-P41 = [29,30,34,16,17,14,12], avg\u224821.71). On-hand=67, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0, current stock covers ~3 periods of this recent demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically. I set L to default (use promised 0). To adapt to the new low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (the detected recent regime length, >=3), so the OR backend will target a much lower base-stock reflecting the sustained drop and reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: recent Periods35-41 avg=21.71 vs prior Periods1-34 avg=70.59 (\u221269%), lead time remains 0 (orders P1..P41 arrived same period).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has been in the low regime confirmed at Period 35 (Periods 35-42 avg \u224821.7). On-hand=46, in-transit=0; lead time historically confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding given low recent demand and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat targeting the recent low-demand regime: choose N=8 (Periods 35-42) to capture the sustained drop while meeting the N selection rule. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock small (matches current low demand) to reduce holding cost while preserving service level for the lower demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time=0 throughout (orders P1..P43 arrived same period); recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 35 (recent periods 35-43 avg\u224821.7 vs prior avg\u224870.6). I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate focusing on the low-demand regime (N=9, Periods 35-43) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility \u2014 this reduces orders to avoid holding cost given sustained low demand and no in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent weeks show the low-demand regime detected at Period 35 (Periods 35-44 low demand). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore use L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (the recent low-demand regime length from Periods 35-44) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders down to avoid high holding costs while maintaining a high service quantile (profit/ (profit+holding) =0.8) suited to this SKU.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent history shows persistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 confirmed many times) and a prolonged low-demand regime since Period 35 (avg ~21.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Given strong evidence of stable lead time=0 and no clear new demand regime shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff without overfitting short-term noise.

======================================================================

Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting at Period 35 (Periods 35-46 avg\u224821.7). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0. To avoid overstock in this low-demand regime I use the promised lead time and base demand forecasts on the recent regime (last 12 periods, Periods 35-46). Methods: L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to scale forecast to current low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility and keep safety stock modest compared to spike periods. This reduces holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand pattern.
