Demand regime: Period 1 conclude shows an order of 86 arrived same period (lead_time observed=0) and demand was censored at 111 (sold 86, stockout). This indicates true demand at least 111 in Period 1 and suggests demand may be higher than the historical sample mean; use a conservative/upward-adjusted forecast.

With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period 2 and can satisfy Period 2 demand. Decision logic: holding cost = profit ($1/unit each), so overstock is costly; aim to meet expected demand without large surplus.

Use recent on-site demand as primary signal. c) Lead-time & orders: Concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0 observed twice), so supplier is currently delivering with 0 period lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0.
