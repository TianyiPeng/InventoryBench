Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unknown. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224886.2 and std \u224812.6. Use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps initial policy simple until arrivals/lead-time evidence appears.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand jumped (Period1 sold=87 with demand=111) above prior samples (historical mean ~86). Last 3 periods show increased average (79,96,111 \u2192 mean ~95.3), so I bias forecast to recent regime while keeping promised lead time (recent arrival showed lead_time=0). Choose L=default to trust promised 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent uptick over the short horizon (1+L periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the apparent demand increase while holding cost equals profit, so moderate uplift is appropriate. No evidence of sustained lead-time change or lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time=0; concluded arrivals in P1 and P2 show actual lead_time=0. Recent demand surged (P1=111, P2=159) above earlier historical weekly mean (~86). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-times (avg=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (captures last three weeks: 2019-02-04, P1, P2) to reflect the upward shift; same N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases base_stock to raise service vs. lost sales while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 3 weeks (2019-02-04,2019-02-11,2019-02-18) avg=122 vs prior historical avg\u224886 (+41%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick: last 3 concluded weeks avg demand \u2248122 vs prior ~86 (+41%). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Given the clear recent regime, set lead time by calculating observed lead times and set demand forecast using the most recent 3 samples to capture the higher regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This raises base_stock to cover the higher demand while profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5), so we prioritize matching the recent mean to avoid stockouts without excess holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived with W=0). Recent demand shows a higher regime vs older history; using the most recent 3-week regime (demands 159,126,91 \u2192 avg\u2248125) better captures current demand than the long-run mean. Therefore: infer L from observed lead times (calculate), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated recent mean across the review+lead window, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while the confirmed L=0 avoids extra pipeline assumptions, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand: last 5 period demands = [111,159,126,91,92]; on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a recent elevated regime around Periods 1-3 but most recent three weeks (Periods 3-5) average ~103; to be responsive to recent shifts while limiting inventory risk, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 weeks. This targets replenishment to recent demand dynamics and keeps holding cost in check given profit=holding ($1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1-6 are all 0 (orders arrived same period). Demand history (most recent 6 demands): [111,159,126,91,92,127]. I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead time=0 from concluded arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures recent spike and variability) so the OR backend sets base-stock to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost with recent demand evidence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3 (recent avg \u2248122 vs prior \u224886). On-hand=11, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low versus elevated demand; no overdue arrivals observed. I keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead time 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher post-changepoint mean (periods 3\u20137) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These settings raise the base-stock to meet the new regime while the sigma estimate adjusts safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows every past order arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-8), so actual L=0 confirmed \u2014 use calculate to reflect observed lead times. Recent demand regime persists: last 3 demand observations (Periods 6-8 = 127,108,130) avg\u2248122 (+~41% vs prior historical avg\u224886). To capture the confirmed upward shift and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (reflecting the most recent regime). This raises the target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand remains elevated vs early history (see carry-over insight from Period 3). On-hand=9, in-transit=0, so no confirmed incoming units. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time estimate from observed data and use a recent-5-week demand estimate (captures latest regime while smoothing week-to-week noise). Sigma likewise from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently (orders in P1\u2013P10 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been variable but the last 5 concluded demands (P6\u2013P10 = 127,108,130,113,63) give a current view near 108 units/week; earlier carry-over noted a spike in early Feb but subsequent weeks moderated. I choose L=default (promised 0) because observed lead times are consistently 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to keep the forecast responsive to the most recent demand regime (captures recent moderation after the Feb spike). sigma_hat=default to let the backend use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). With L=0 this keeps base_stock close to the recent mean, balancing service level vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5 => z\u22480). This sizing, combined with current on-hand=51 and no pipeline, should prompt the OR engine to replenish toward the recent-demand-driven base stock while avoiding excess holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows varying weekly demand with no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Feb spike. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to emphasize the most recent 5 demand observations (captures short-term shifts) while using default sigma_hat to rely on full-sample volatility. This balances service (react to recent demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding, and accounts for no observed lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has been variable; use the last 5 weeks to reflect the most recent regime (weeks ending 2019/4/1\u20132019/4/29) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend can target a service level aligned with current demand while limiting holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has settled lower than the spike observed in Feb; last 5 observed demands (Periods 9-13) average \u224881.8, so use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to adapt to the current regime while avoiding overreacting to single-week noise. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to match volatility to the same recent window. This keeps base-stock responsive to the current lower demand and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history concluded with lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 10-14 = 63,78,86,69,83) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier spike; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current 5-week mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps target stock aligned to recent demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service given zero observed lead time and no in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows variable weekly demand but no new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded Period 3 shift, so use default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201319) show consistent actual lead_time = 0 and no lost shipments. Recent weeks (noted earlier) showed a temporary demand uptick but the series since mid-May has moderated. Current on-hand=46, in-transit=0; typical weekly demand historically ~86 (sample mean ~86 from initial history) so on-hand covers ~0.5\u20131 week. I select L=default to trust promised 0 lead time (historical confirms). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overfitting recent noise. No evidence of lost shipments requiring explicit lead-time adjustment.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has fallen vs spring: last 5 realized demands (Periods 16-20) = [70,73,54,33,27], avg\u224851, far below earlier highs. On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically observed=0\u2014no evidence of longer lead time. To avoid excess holding given low recent demand, set L=default (use promised 0) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to capture the downward regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target stock and also reflects lower volatility. This balances service (cover short-term demand) against holding cost given current high on-hand.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically (orders in P1\u2013P20 all arrived with lead_time 0; last conclude P21: ordered=0, arrived=0). Recent demand (Periods 19-21: 33,27,39) is lower than the earlier spike; no new sustained demand regime (needs 3+ periods of consistent shift beyond noise). To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) and no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively.

Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while capturing short-term variability; sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (react to recent demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: Periods 21-25) averages ~47 units/week, noticeably lower than earlier-year spike. To respond to the recent lower summer demand while preserving responsiveness, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast and volatility from the recent 5-week window so the OR engine focuses orders on current regime and avoids excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

The earlier documented demand regime shift (Period 3) is the only sustained change; recent weeks do not show a new 3+ period sustained change. With profit and holding costs equal ($1/$1) I keep promised lead time and use full-sample demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock balancing fill vs. holding costs.

Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 24,50,76,136,85) better reflects current summer pattern and recent volatility; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the large week-27 spike while keeping window small enough to react. These parameters aim to let the OR backend set a base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost given current short pipeline and recent demand variability.

Recent demand (Periods 25-29) = [50,76,136,85,87], recent 5-week avg \u2248 86.8 which reflects current summer demand; historical data shows earlier Feb spike already captured in carry-over.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Periods 26-30 demands: 76,83,68,75,87 with two large spikes at P27=136 and P30=164) suggesting a higher short-run mean and higher uncertainty than long-run history. All concluded lead-time observations are 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. To react quickly to recent elevated demand while limiting excess holding, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks (captures short-term mean/volatility without overfitting single-week spikes). These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during recent higher-demand regime while sigma_hat increases safety stock to guard against the observed spikes; using recent data avoids inflating orders from older low-demand periods.

Recent demand (Periods 27-31) is elevated (5-week avg \u2248114 units vs long-run \u224886), so forecast using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the target base-stock to meet shortfall risk while avoiding excess inventory from older, lower-demand weeks.

No new sustained demand regime change since prior insight (Period 3 shift already recorded); therefore use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 30-33: 164,99,94,168) is elevated vs prior history; I detect a recent high-demand regime of length 4 and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a higher base stock while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current spikes) against holding cost by limiting the window to recent data rather than raising long-run mean.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike at Periods 30-33: avg=131.25 vs prior long-run avg\u224886 (+52%); treat as sustained elevated demand (4 periods).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent sustained demand elevation detected around Periods 30-33 (avg\u2248131 vs long-run \u224886, +~52%) and carried into Period 34. To respond, keep L=default (promised 0). Raise demand forecast using recent data: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the elevated 4-week regime. Match sigma_hat to recent volatility with recent_N N=4 so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders with its internal cap.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent demand elevated since early Sept (Periods 30-33 spike previously recorded). Last 5 observed demands (Periods 31-35 = 99,94,168,83,103) average ~109.4 \u2014 higher than long-run historical average. Promised lead time has been 0 historically, so keep L=default. To adapt to the recent sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated short-term mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the elevated regime without overcommitting to long-term higher inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Recent history shows intermittent spikes (Sept) but recent 4 weeks demand has softened; no new sustained demand or lead-time regime confirmed. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7long-run mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service vs holding given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has returned below the Sep spike: last 5 demands (P34-38) = [83,103,74,47,49], recent mean\u224871.2. On-hand=39, in-transit=0. All observed lead times have concluded as 0 historically, so keep promised lead time (default). To reflect the current lower post-spike regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the backend sizes base-stock to cover the near-term demand pattern rather than older high-demand weeks. This balances service (cover ~1 period ahead) vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (no evidence of delays), so use promised lead time. Recent demand showed a sustained elevated regime around Periods 30-33 (4 weeks) per provided insights; to be responsive I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility to capture the higher recent average. This increases the base-stock target to better cover (1+L) periods of demand and reduces expected stockouts while the holding cost equals profit (balanced tradeoff).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has settled below the summer peak; last 5 demands (Periods 36-40) = [74,47,49,52,44], recent mean \u2248 53.6. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change (historical concluded lead_times = 0). I select L=default to use promised 0. To capture the recent lower regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk versus using long-run elevated means. This balances the equal profit/holding cost by tightening base-stock to recent demand while preserving service for short-term variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history (Periods 1-41) shows all observed lead_times = 0, so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 47,49,52,44,57) averages ~49.8; demand has moderated since the Sept spike. To keep service with minimal holding (profit=holding so q=0.5), set lead time = calculate (confirmed 0) and use a recent-N estimate for demand and volatility to reflect the latest regime. Using N=5 captures the most recent stable demand without over-weighting older spikes. These parameters give the OR backend a current-period forecast (1+L periods) tuned to recent sales, balancing stockouts vs holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 across many periods. Recent high weekly demands (e.g. P42 demand=141, earlier Sept spikes) appear episodic, not a sustained >=3-period regime change. To avoid overreacting to short spikes and because promised lead time matches observed history, use default lead time and default demand moments (uses long-run sample mean/std across all samples). This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows volatility with a one-off large spike (Period 42 demand=141). To be responsive to current demand regime while limiting sensitivity to single outliers, use recent_N over the most recent 5 weeks for demand mean and std (captures short-term trend including recent spike but keeps sample size >=3). These parameters give the OR backend a short-horizon demand forecast and volatility to balance service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each). No shipments appear overdue.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times have all been 0 (orders repeatedly arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent carry-over notes already document prior elevated demand periods; no new sustained changepoint in the last 3+ concluded periods (demand recent sequence messy: 141 then back to ~52s), so use default demand estimates to avoid overreacting. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR backend apply its base-stock formula calibrated to long-run sample statistics and the promised lead time, balancing the 1:1 profit/holding tradeoff without introducing aggressive overstock given limited on-hand inventory and no confirmed new regime.

Recent weeks show a one-off large demand (141 at Period 42) but no sustained regime shift in the last 3+ periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed prompt arrivals and long-run demand statistics, I use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimators so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show no sustained demand increase (one large spike at Period 42 then normal ~50s), so no new regime detected. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0). To avoid overreacting to the isolated spike and given symmetric profit=holding cost, use default calculations: L=default (promised), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to long-run demand while the system observes any future sustained shifts; it balances service vs holding given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.
