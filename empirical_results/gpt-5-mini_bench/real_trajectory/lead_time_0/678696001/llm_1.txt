Given supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown, we must balance risk: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so carrying inventory into the next period erodes expected profit. Therefore the prudent policy is to target expected demand for the coming selling period only (avoid building safety stock unless lead-time evidence appears). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so to meet period demand we must order now. Final order logic: order forecast \u2248 mean(5 weeks) \u2248 185 units to meet expected period sales while minimizing end-of-period inventory exposure.",
