No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time unknown so assume arrivals may not be same-period. Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and potential Valentine uplift, target supply roughly equal to the historical mean (~108) to maximize sales while keeping holding cost exposure limited. Order sized to cover this period's demand (and shortfall if lead time >0).",
