{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), so orders placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Recent concluded weekly demands: P43=98, P44=232 (stock-limited), P45=176, P46=151 \u2192 recent average \u2248164 units/week; demand has been elevated through December. OR recommended 152 units using historical demand and promised L=0; with profit $19 >> holding $1, bias toward avoiding stockouts. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 152 units to bring available inventory to 178 (26+152), which covers expected demand (~150\u2013170) while limiting excessive holding cost. Final strategy: order 152 units (arrive this period) to meet elevated holiday demand and reduce stockout risk.",
