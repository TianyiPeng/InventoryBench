Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders have consistently arrived same period). Inventory & demand: on-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent demand is highly elevated and volatile through Dec (Period 45=181, P46=155), indicating a holiday spike that likely persists into Period 47 (2019-12-30). OR recommends 112 using historical averages and promised L; that recommendation understates current realized demand spikes. With L=0 an order placed now will arrive for Period 47 demand, so I top-up to cover expected high demand while limiting excess holding cost. Decision: order 115 units so on-hand+arrival = 45+115 = 160 units, which targets recent high single-period demand (~155) plus a small buffer. This modest increase over OR's 112 reduces stockout risk during the holiday spike while keeping holding cost exposure limited.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 112\u2192115 because actual lead time=0 and recent demands spiked (P45=181, P46=155); 115 plus current 45 gives 160 to cover likely ~155 demand with small buffer.",
