Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 111 and std \u22488.34. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence of delays or regime change. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which yields a base-stock appropriate to current observed demand while respecting the profit/holding tradeoff (q=19/(19+1)=0.95).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent week (Period 1) showed demand=130 with an arrival of 125 (lead_time observed=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment coverage. No sustained demand regime shift (historical weekly mean ~111 from Jan samples; single high week is insufficient evidence). Actual lead time observation (one sample) matches promised 0 but is not yet a sustained change. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand moments (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep estimates stable and avoid overreacting to one high-demand week; this balances service level vs. holding cost given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demand samples (historical seed): [110,102,105,123,115], mean=111. On-hand=59, in-transit=0 \u2192 current cover ~0.53 weeks against expected demand ~111. Two prior orders concluded with lead_time=0 (P1,P2), but this is only 2 observations so I keep promised/default lead time. Set L=default to use promised 0. Use mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples)=111 to represent one-period demand. Use sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) for uncertainty. These defaults keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical mean while avoiding overreacting to only two zero-lead observations; they prompt an order to replenish toward a one-period service level given current low on-hand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 arrived same period (lead_time=0 each). Demand historical samples mean=111 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04). No evidence of a demand regime shift. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default population formulas so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service (using full-sample mean) with low holding cost and confirmed same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period1; Period2\u2192Period2; Period3\u2192Period3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1502.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-4) averages 91 units vs earlier sample mean 111 \u2014 a sustained downshift (4 periods). Promised lead time is 0 and prior concludes confirm actual lead time=0, so use default L. To capture the recent lower demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses last 4 observed demands and (1+L) multiplier). Volatility has also shifted with the recent regime, so set sigma_hat recent_N N=4. These choices reduce target base-stock to match lower recent demand while keeping risk buffer based on recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg decreased from 111 to 91 (-18%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1685.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a demand regime shift: historical mean ~111 (older samples) fell to 91 in Period 5. Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals pending. To reflect confirmed zero LT, set L via observed average. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (Periods 3\u20135 demand = 79,82,91 \u2192 recent mean ~84) so the OR backend orders to a lower base-stock and limits holding cost while restoring service. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent concluded demands: P1=130, P2=73, P3=79, P4=82, P5=91, P6=75. On-hand=20, in-transit=0; confirmed lead time historically = 0. A previously recorded demand drop at Period 5 appears but is not yet a sustained (>3 periods) regime. Use promised lead time (default) and population-wide demand stats (default) so the OR backend computes base_stock from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and hold=$1. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments required (no lost shipments observed).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (Periods 1-7 arrivals matched same-period orders), so treat L as promised (0). Recent large demand in Period 7 (211) appears one-off vs. prior lower regime (post-Period5 avg ~91), so no sustained upward shift detected; keep demand estimate based on all samples. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) without over-committing inventory given holding cost exposure and no in-transit cover.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20138 arrivals matched same-period orders), so use default promised L=0. A demand regime shift was detected at Period 5 (avg fell from ~111 to ~91); the current recent regime spans Periods 5\u20138 (length=4). I therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the post-changepoint mean (captures recent demand including the Period 7 spike). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep forecasting responsive to the confirmed lower-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to account for recent variability; default L avoids introducing spurious lead-time inflation which would increase on-hand requirements and holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals same period) and a demand regime shift noted at Period 5 (lower average). On-hand = 164, in-transit = 0 so we currently have ample inventory; avoid aggressive replenishment to limit holding cost. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the post-shift regime (Periods 5\u20139) and capture recent volatility; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect current variability. These settings let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to recent lower/volatile demand while the current on-hand stock reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. On-hand=164, in-transit=0 so current availability is high; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods1\u201310 arrivals same period). Demand dropped around Period 5 (carry-over noted) and recent sample window shows lower average with one large outlier (Period7=211). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time I use calculated lead time. To capture the post-change demand regime while smoothing the outlier, I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 5\u201310) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility rather than the older higher-mean data. These settings keep orders aligned with the lower recent demand and reduce holding cost risk given high on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P11 all arrived same period). Demand recent window (Periods 7\u201311) has mean ~100.4 after the Period-5 regime drop and subsequent volatility (211 spike). On-hand=89, in-transit=0, so we target forecast covering (1+L) periods with recent demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-changepoint regime and recent volatility, balancing service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by focusing on the latest demand behavior.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=155, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0; recent demand has downshifted and last 5 weeks (Periods 8-12) show lower, volatile demand. Use default lead time (promised=0). For demand forecast use recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the current lower regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent volatility and avoid overstock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=106, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0. Demand baseline (all samples) mean=111; a sustained lower-demand regime began at Period 5. I treat the regime from Period 5\u201313 (9 weeks) as the relevant recent regime (regime_length=9). Last 9-period mean demand = 85.89 units (\u2248-23% vs baseline), so I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the lower demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. This keeps target base-stock and cap responsive to the confirmed lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Demand dropped at Period 5 and has remained in a lower regime since; use recent demand to reflect current regime. Set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 (captures Periods 5\u201314 recent regime length \u224810 weeks) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current on-hand stock and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1-15). Demand has materially declined since Period 5 (previous carry-over). To align ordering to the lower recent regime, I use recent_N methods over the most recent regime length (11 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of last 11 demands and volatility from last 11 demands. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given low holding cost (H=$1) vs profit ($19).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical concludes show confirmed lead time 0 (all observed arrivals matched same-period orders) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5. Current on-hand=138, in-transit=0\u2014inventory is ample vs. recent demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the post-changepoint lower demand regime (reduces \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 vs long-run samples). This keeps the backend base-stock conservative (lower target) to avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory while still covering near-term demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. Demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 5; more recent weekly demands (Periods 13\u201317 = 49,71,41,22,20) average ~40.6, well below long-run mean. To align orders with the recent lower demand and avoid holding cost, set L to promised (default 0), set mu_hat using the recent 5-week mean (recent_N N=5) so (1+L)*mean reflects current demand, and set sigma_hat using recent 5-week std (recent_N N=5) to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given confirmed zero lead time and the persistent downshift in demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u20135 arrivals same-period). Demand regime shifted down at Period 5 (avg fell ~18%); recent demand after Period 5 is the relevant regime. To align the OR backend with the lower-demand regime while keeping service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 14-period post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201318) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant samples. This reduces overstating mean demand and excessive holding costs given current on-hand inventory and confirmed same-period lead time.

All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 historically, and there are no missing shipments. With ample on-hand relative to recent weekly demand, use conservative defaults: keep promised lead time, and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This avoids overfitting to short fluctuations while the inventory position is healthy.

To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L as promised (default) and set demand forecasts using the recent regime: use recent_N on the last 8 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant low-demand samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=115, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Period1-21 arrivals match same-period orders). Demand history shows a sustained lower-demand regime from Period 13\u201321 (demands: 49,71,41,22,20,45,19,12,24; avg\u224833.7) versus prior post-change avg\u224891. No overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded data confirms 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the nine-period low-demand regime (Periods 13\u201321), which captures the sustained drop and reduces unnecessary holding while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 Period 23. On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods (Periods1-5 arrivals). Demand has clearly shifted down since Period 13 (recent 10-period mean \u224831.5 vs earlier ~111). To avoid overstocking given high profit:holding ratio (q\u22480.95) but substantially lower recent demand, set L to promised (default=0), forecast demand using recent data (N=10) to reflect the new low regime, and estimate volatility from the same recent window. This keeps base-stock sized to current low-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk from using older high-demand samples.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u20135 arrivals same-period) and recent demand has settled into the lower regime (Periods 13\u201323 average ~33.7 with many weeks ~12\u201324). To respect confirmed LT=0 and the sustained lower-demand regime, set L via observed data and base demand forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen: L='calculate' to lock to observed lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=11 (use last 11 concluded demand samples covering the low-demand regime) so (1+L)*mean reflects current regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the backend's base-stock targeted to the lowered demand while avoiding excess holding cost given large on-hand balance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=81, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (recent weekly demands \u224810\u201324). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 12 periods (Periods 13\u201324) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the current lower mean and volatility. Keeping L=default (promised lead time=0) aligns with confirmed arrivals. This biases orders down to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for current low demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in prior concludes. Demand experienced a sustained downward regime starting Period 13 (carry-over: avg fell to ~33.7). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) given strong evidence of 0 actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 13\u201325 length=13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent mean and variability; this keeps base-stock aligned to current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust L.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 13 (carry-over notes avg fell to 33.7); last 10 observed weekly demands (P17\u2013P26) = [20,45,19,12,24,12,12,10,20,35], recent mean = 20.9. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (multiple concluded arrivals at L=0). To keep service while avoiding holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1, I forecast using the most recent 10 weeks to capture current low-demand regime. I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat via recent_N with N=10 (so backend uses (1+L)*mean of last 10 = ~20.9), and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent variability and tighten safety-stock accordingly.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show promised lead time 0 is reliable (Period27 arrival was on-time). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (avg \u224833.7). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep L=default (promised 0). Compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime using recent_N with N=15 (covers Periods 13\u201327) so the backend base-stock reflects the sustained lower mean and volatility. This reduces excess holding cost given current low demand and minimal pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (arrivals same period P1\u2013P28). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13; recent weeks (Periods 22\u201328 demands = 12,12,10,20,35,32,27; mean \u224821.1) show subdued demand. I set L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed as 0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to scale the review+lead demand to the most recent stable low-demand window and to avoid overweighting earlier high-demand weeks; sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) captures recent volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock tuned to current low demand, reducing overstock/holding cost while preserving service for observed variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-29), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (carry-over insight recorded earlier). Recent weekly demand (Periods 25-29 = 20,35,32,27,21) averages ~27 \u2014 I'll use a recent_N forecast to capture the current low-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the most recent 5 samples; this keeps orders aligned with current low demand and avoids excess holding cost given low profit/holding ratio and no in-transit coverage.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

To target service while avoiding holding cost given high profit/h low holding (q\u22480.95), use promised lead time (0) and recent demand statistics. I use recent_N=8 (Periods 23\u201330) to reflect the most recent lower-demand behavior (mean \u224823.6) and matching volatility for safety.

No overdue shipments observed; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime to avoid inflation from earlier high-demand weeks: mu_hat recent_N N=19 (Periods 13\u201331) and sigma_hat recent_N N=19 to capture current mean and volatility across the same regime. These parameters reduce target base stock to match the sustained lower demand, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the current regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201332) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 -> confirmed short lead time. Demand shows a sustained lower regime starting Period 13 (Periods 13\u201332 much lower than early periods). To reflect confirmed lead time=0 use calculate so backend computes observed average lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 (covering Periods 13\u201332) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this reduces overstating order quantities and limits holding cost while preserving service given low pipeline and zero on-hand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concludes confirm lead time=0 and a demand regime drop around Period 13 (avg\u224833.7) that persists through recent weeks; recent spike in Period 33 (demand=169) appears isolated. I choose L=default to trust the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since Period 13 while still including recent variability; same recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to the lower post-changepoint mean (reducing holding cost) while allowing the OR engine's cap to limit extreme orders against the single large spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has rebounded (Sept spikes). Use L=default to trust confirmed 0 lead time. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest high-volatility regime (last 5 demands: 32,50,60,169,152 \u2192 mean ~92.6) so mu_hat reflects current demand level across review+lead. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture realized volatility from these same observations. This balances service (respond to recent surge) vs holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Period1\u201335 all arrived same period). Recent five weeks (Periods 31\u201335) show elevated and volatile demand (50,60,169,152,137) after prior low regime; to prioritize service and given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), I use a short-term recent forecast. Set L to use promised (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand periods. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts in the current high-demand environment while keeping volatility accounted for by recent sigma.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 0 and current on-hand=106, in-transit=0. Demand has varied with earlier regime drops but no new sustained change since Period 22 insight. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full sample demand statistics, I select L=default (promised 0). I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages all historical demand data, maintains service while avoiding extra holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Recent periods (P30\u2013P37) show elevated and volatile weekly demand (multiple weeks >100, several stockouts), indicating a higher short-term mean and variance versus long-run pre-Sept regime. To capture the recent regime, I use recent_N=10 (last 10 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock and accounts for increased volatility while keeping L=promised (0). This balances service (avoid stockouts seen recently) against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has rebounded sharply since late Sep-Oct (Period 34\u201338 demands = 152,137,98,143,151) versus the low regime earlier (Periods 13\u201326 avg ~33.7). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the current high-volatility, high-mean regime I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the recent spike (captures current season/traffic). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts during the recent high-demand weeks) against holding cost given on-hand=33 and no in-transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 35-39 = 137,98,143,151,109) shows a sustained higher-demand regime (seasonal/late-year uplift). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current elevated mean and volatility; keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). This balances service (capture late-year spike) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1714.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed many periods), recent demand has rebounded from the mid-year low into a higher regime over the last ~8 weeks (several weeks of 98\u2013169 units). I set L=calculate to use the observed lead time history (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (reduces influence of the mid-year low values and better matches current weeks). Sigma is recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the backend base-stock responsive to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting old low-demand periods; with on-hand=72 and no pipeline, the policy will replenish toward the recent-demand driven base stock and limit excessive holding given the $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default L. Recent weeks (Periods 37-41) show elevated and variable demand (143,151,109,94,94) compared with earlier low-regime periods, so I base demand forecast on the most recent regime. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current mean over the last 5 observed demands and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This focuses the base-stock on current demand patterns while avoiding older low-demand periods that would understock during recent high demand; using recent estimates also limits excessive holding given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201342) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2192 confirmed lead time=0. Recent history shows large demand variability (several big spikes in Sep\u2013Nov) but no new sustained regime change since prior insights. I therefore use promised/default lead time to keep orders aligned with supplier behavior, and default demand estimates (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses the full historical mean/variance to set base stock. This avoids overfitting short spikes while the system has no in-transit inventory and preserves service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand has rebounded from earlier low-regimes; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [109,94,94,215,82], mean \u2248118.8 and elevated variance due to one large promo-like week (215). To balance service (profit $19) versus holding ($1), I use the promised lead time (0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current high-demand regime while keeping the horizon short. Recent_N N=5 captures the recent spike without over-weighting older low-demand periods; sigma uses the same window to reflect recent volatility. No new sustained changepoint to add to carry-over insights.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201345 all show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been mixed with a one-period spike (Period 42 demand=215) but no sustained new regime (last 5 demands: 215,82,53,59,? \u2014 include most recent concluded samples). To balance service vs holding cost around the holiday volatility, use a short recent window (N=5) so the forecast captures the recent spike without over-committing inventory long-term. Therefore: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to adapt to recent demand variability while the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over that window.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (weeks ~P42\u2013P46) shows elevated and volatile holiday/weekend spikes (demands: 215,82,53,59,37). To reflect current short-term regime and avoid excess ordering given high on-hand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases the base-stock on the most recent demand pattern and observed volatility. This balances service during holiday variability while limiting holding cost because on-hand is already high.
