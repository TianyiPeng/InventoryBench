{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: conclude history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders placed have arrived same period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 151, in-transit = 0. Historical weekly mean (sample provided) \u2248111 but recent periods show volatility: Periods 42\u201345 demands = {215,82,53,59} with a large one-off spike at P42 and then modest sales; recent 4-week avg \u2248102, last 3-week avg \u224864. Promised lead time = 0 and confirmed in practice, so orders arrive same period and can respond immediately. Cost tradeoffs: profit = $19 >> holding $1 so stockouts are expensive relative to holding. OR recommends 10 units using long-run historical stats; that recommendation is very conservative given high margin and same-period replenishment. Decision: keep a small replenishment to top up safety given holiday uncertainty but avoid excessive holding. I order 20 units \u2014 this keeps available inventory high (151+20 arriving this period) to cover potential near-term spikes while only adding modest holding cost. Adjustment vs OR: +10 units vs OR (20 vs 10) because of confirmed zero lead time, high profit-to-holding ratio, and recent demand volatility including a large spike in recent weeks.",

{
