Given high recent demand and upcoming Valentine\u2019s-related uplift, target to meet roughly one week of expected demand while avoiding large holding cost (holding = $1/unit/period, profit = $4/unit). Therefore place an order to cover near the recent high-week demand (conservative service approach): 90 units.
