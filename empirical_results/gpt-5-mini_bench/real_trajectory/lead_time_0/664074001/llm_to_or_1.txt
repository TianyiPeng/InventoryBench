Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly samples show rising demand (last five weeks: 82,52,45,99,108) with the most recent week high (108). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current period. Promised lead time is 0; no concluded arrivals to contradict it, so use default lead time. Forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent uptick (mu_hat recent_N, N=5). Use default sigma (all-sample std scaled) since variance signal is noisy and sample count is small. This balances service (capture recent rise) against holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows Period1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P1 with lead_time=0 and demand last concluded =105 (sold 101). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for upcoming demand. No multi-period evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change; use defaults which leverage full historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (using historical mean forecast) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time=0; observed arrivals in Periods 1\u20132 were same-period (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a rise (last three demands: 108, 105, 188). To remain responsive to the apparent recent increase while keeping lead time assumption aligned with observed history, use default lead time (promised=0), and set demand and volatility from the most recent 3 samples to capture the upward shift and short-term variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $541.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = [105, 188, 143], on-hand=31, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical sample mean (earlier 5-sample series) = 77.2; recent 3-period mean = 145.3, indicating a sustained upward shift (3 periods). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0). For demand I use recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat uses the (1+L)*recent mean so the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility and avoid under-stocking given the spike; this balances higher profit per unit vs holding cost by increasing safety stock only to match recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting in recent periods: recent avg = 145.3 (Periods 1-3) vs historical avg = 77.2 (+88%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $400.00, Daily Holding Cost: $81.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has jumped vs historical (recent avg ~145 vs historical ~77), sustained across the last 3 periods (P2\u2013P4). On-hand = 81, in-transit = 0 so available stock covers ~0.6\u20130.8 of one recent-period demand; no overdue shipments observed. Observed concluded lead times = 0 for all arrived orders \u2192 set L using observed average. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (uses the most recent 3 demand observations) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility; this keeps base-stock responsive to the ~88% increase while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed demand uplift while limiting excess hold cost by using a short recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $229.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated vs historical (carry-over: sustained regime shift noted earlier). On-hand=99, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To adapt to the higher recent demand and increased uncertainty while respecting promised lead time, I use the default promised L, and set demand parameters based on the most recent 3 periods to capture the new regime and recent volatility. This raises the base-stock forecast while keeping holding risk controlled via the OR cap.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weeks show elevated demand vs older historical baseline (carry-over notes regime shift). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I keep L as default (promised 0; observed lead times have consistently been 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the OR engine sets a higher base-stock and accounts for recent volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. This balances higher service level needed for the sustained demand increase against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=39, in-transit=0; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-7 = 100,82,95,114) is materially above historical Jan samples and shows a sustained higher regime vs the oldest data. All observed lead times = 0 historically. To react to the more recent demand pattern while keeping lead-time assumption consistent, use L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to base forecast on the last 4 weeks' mean across review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand while the cap prevents extreme overordering and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand elevated vs historical (recent 3-period avg \u2248127 vs historical ~77). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need to replenish to cover expected elevated demand. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 consistently, so use default promised L. To capture the recent sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (focus on last 3 demands). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping lead time at the observed 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P9), so use promised lead time. Recent demand in the most recent regime is elevated and sustained for 3 periods (Period 7\u20139 demands: 114, 173, 112), supporting a short-window forecast. Given high profit vs holding (profit=$4, holding=$1 => service quantile high), I bias toward recent demand to preserve service while limiting excess holding. Therefore: L=default (promised); mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime; sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=41, in-transit=0; recent concluded lead times all 0 so promised lead time appears reliable. Recent demand has been above historical baseline (last 5 demands: 95,114,173,112,122) indicating a sustained higher regime. To respond to the higher recent mean while keeping volatility estimation focused on the same window, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock for the elevated demand; L kept default (promised=0) since all concluded lead times = 0 and no overdue shipments observed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained upward regime starting around Period 4 (carry-over note: recent avg 145.3 vs historical 77.2, sustained 3 periods). To respond to the higher recent demand while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat using recent data (capture the new regime) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. L kept default so orders remain same-period in OR backend; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=3 to focus the forecast on the confirmed regime shift and raise target base-stock and safety stock appropriately.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we are fully out-of-stock going into the demand period. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand appears elevated versus older historical samples; to react quickly I use a recent-sample forecast to capture the current regime. L set by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime and increase responsiveness while the backend caps orders to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=57, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand (Periods 11-13 = 105,125,93) averages ~107.7, lower than the earlier flagged high regime; evidence not strong enough to record a new sustained shift. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded history \u2014 use default L. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the last three weeks' demand while the backend scales for (1+L). This balances service (captures recent demand) vs holding cost (avoids overstock if the high regime faded).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=77.2 (from provided samples) but recent periods show a sustained higher regime (noted in carry-over: recent avg=145.3 over a 3-period shift). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To respond to the confirmed recent demand regime, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) but use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the higher recent demand. I choose N=3 (matches the detected 3-period regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the newest regime and help the OR backend raise the base-stock to avoid stockouts while the higher holding cost ($1) is balanced by using only a short recent window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand elevated vs historical: last 3 realized demands = [93,100,118], recent mean \u2248103.7 vs long-run historical mean \u224877.2. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 \u2192 clearly insufficient for next period's demand. Promised lead time has been 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L as default (0). To respond to the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (focus on the most recent 3-week regime). These parameters push the OR engine to target stock reflecting the recent higher mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock; this balances higher service level against holding cost given current low inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders always arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (noted earlier): I will use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher recent demand rather than the long-run mean. Set L=default (promised 0) so OR uses same-period replenishment. Use mu_hat recent_N to reflect the recent higher demand (N=3 to match the detected 3-period regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility and avoid underestimating safety stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders arriving same period). Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 demands (Periods 13-17) = 93,100,118,139,203, average \u2248130.6, noticeably above long-run historical mean (~77). To cover current period plus lead, keep L=default (promised 0) since concluded history shows 0 L. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to respond to the sustained higher demand regime and increased variability, so the OR engine raises base-stock while keeping cap constraints. This balances higher service level (reduce stockouts) vs holding cost by basing forecast on the most recent regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Recent demand has shifted up and is sustained: Periods 15-18 demand = [118,139,203,194], recent avg \u2248 163.5 vs earlier historical avg ~77.2 (previously noted). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + L future demand. I set L=default to trust promised 0 (confirmed by concluded history). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 4 weeks of demand), which raises the base-stock forecast and the safety stock to reduce stockouts given higher recent demand while still letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated for many periods (e.g., demands in P12-P19 include several >120, recent P17-19: 203,194,139). To capture the recent higher mean and volatility I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 demand samples (balances responsiveness vs noise). These params direct the OR engine to raise the base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat from recent data preserves safety stock.

Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) and for sigma_hat (N=3) so the OR engine builds base_stock to cover the elevated short-run mean and variance while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Recent demand remains above long-run historical levels; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the elevated regime. Chose N=5 (Periods 19-23 demands = 139,93,85,119,92; recent mean ~105.6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect current volatility. This raises the base-stock to protect service while keeping holding cost in check given profit/holding ratio.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/07/29. On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been variable but the most recent 5 weeks show a lower mean (~88.6) versus earlier spikes in June; all concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 so use promised lead time. I select L=default to trust concluded history (lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the recent downshift and avoid overstock given holding cost=1 vs profit=4. Sigma is set recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting holding cost exposure given zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 repeatedly. Recent demand (Periods 23-25) = [92, 54, 78], indicating a recent lower-demand regime lasting 3 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates based on the most recent 3-week regime so the OR engine targets a smaller base stock and tighter cap.

Recent demand has moderated versus the early high regime; using a recent window captures current level and variability. I select recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets service for current short-term demand while avoiding excess holding given profit/holding tradeoff.

Promised lead time is 0 and recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals, so use default L. To keep responsiveness to the latest regime while limiting noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 3 weeks (recent_N N=3). This focuses the base-stock on current demand (reducing stockouts) while sigma from recent variability controls safety stock to balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 21-28) shows moderately higher but variable weekly demand (~85\u2013110); to capture the most relevant recent regime I use recent_N over the last 8 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for current observed demand while limiting holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all past orders arrived same period), so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand (Periods 27-29 = 91, 110, 118) indicates current mean \u2248106 units; demand has been elevated versus early historical samples and last 3 periods are representative. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current higher mean over the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility and avoid underestimating risk. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward meeting current demand spikes while keeping holding exposure tied to short lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand shows variability and a recent uptick in some windows; to reflect the most recent realized demand pattern I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (last 5 weeks) so the OR engine sizes the (1+L) demand estimate to current conditions. Sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost by preserving the backend's z* computation (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8). No overdue arrivals observed to force explicit lead-time adjustments.

Recent demand (last few weeks: 118,86,92) shows no sustained new regime versus earlier recorded shift; no fresh changepoint confirmed. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given stable observed lead time and no new sustained demand change.

Recent demand has been higher than long-run historical average; last 5 weeks (Periods 29-33) show elevated demand (~105.6 avg). To capture this upward regime while limiting sensitivity to a single spike (P33=136), use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime. These settings raise the base-stock to meet a high service target (profit/holding -> q=0.8) while sigma based on recent variation avoids excessive safety stock from older low-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use default lead time. Carry-over insight indicates a sustained demand regime shift (recent avg higher, detected at Period 4) \u2014 use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect the higher recent mean (regime length = 3). Chosen N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime while keeping sample size conservative. These parameters increase the base_stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost by using a small recent window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. No new sustained demand/lead-time changepoint detected since prior carry-over. To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand estimates. This keeps the backend's base-stock tuned to the long-run mean while avoiding overreacting to short recent fluctuations; with low on-hand and no pipeline, default settings will prompt replenishment per historical demand profile.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent on-hand=88, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39) = [63,54,75,56,48], recent mean \u224859.2. All observed lead times have been 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To avoid excess holdings while preserving service (profit/holding \u2192 high service target), I use a short recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime: set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5). This reduces target base-stock toward current demand and limits overstock given on-hand=88 and no pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent two periods show low demand (P39=48, P40=34) but this is not yet a 3+ period sustained shift; prior carry-over flagged a sustained regime shift earlier. On-hand=54, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep L as default (use promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to avoid overreacting to short recent dips while preserving service level given profit/holding costs (profit $4, holding $1 implies moderate service target).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Recent demand has shown a sustained upward regime (recent 3-period avg ~145 vs historical ~77). On-hand=89, in-transit=0 so we have immediate coverage but no pipeline. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default L to keep backend assumption. To react quickly to the confirmed demand uplift, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the base_stock reflects the higher short-run mean (captures (1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility and avoid understating risk. These choices bias the optimizer toward higher target inventory (improving service) while sigma update tempers order size by acknowledging increased variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. A previously recorded demand regime shift exists in history but there is no new sustained changepoint in the most recent conclude messages (last demands: 34,46,50), so use default demand statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps. Default choices balance service level vs holding cost by using full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have all been 0 \u2014 no evidence of delay. Recent realized demand (Periods 41-43) is low: 46, 50, 35 (mean \u2248 43.7), so I downweight older high-demand bursts and use a short recent window. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given holding cost >0. This keeps the backend's base-stock conservative while still reacting to short-term demand changes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand has trended down since early Nov: Periods 40-44 demands = [34,46,50,35,61] (low volatility, lower mean than long-run). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so coverage is limited for current-week demand. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (no sustained late arrivals), so keep L=default. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine targets a lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand period. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last period demand spiked to 102 with only 55 available \u2014 stockout risk this period. Historical observed lead times have been 0 (no evidence of delayed shipments). I keep L as default (promised 0). To respond to recent upward demand while remaining conservative given noisy recent weeks, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so recent higher demands get more weight without overreacting to a single spike. I keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility for safety in the backend's capped order calculation. This balances higher service level now vs. holding cost given no confirmed sustained regime change or delayed arrivals.
