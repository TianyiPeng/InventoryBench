Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [140,45,30,95,99] \u2014 mean ~81.8, std ~44.9. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly samples (2019-01) show mean demand \u224881.8/week and std \u224844.4. Period 1 concluded an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 and demand=21, leaving on-hand=134 and in-transit=0 (no expected arrivals). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will produce 0 based on Period 1 conclude). With L=0, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline base-stock that balances service level (via profit/holding tradeoff) against inventory holding given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two orders (P1,P2) both arrived with lead_time=0 and on-hand=120, in-transit=0. Demand history samples (5 weeks) have mean ~81.8. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments and no sustained demand regime change. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given stable recent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $919.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1-3). Recent demand (Periods 1-3 concludes: 21,29,53) averages 34.3, materially below earlier sample mean (~81.8) indicating a downward demand regime. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets replenishment based on the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 3 concluded periods (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25) avg demand=34.3 vs prior sample avg=81.8 (\u2248-58%); treat as sustained until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times for this SKU are consistently 0 (Period1-3 arrived same period). Recent demand regime shows lower mean in the most recent stable window; I'll use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect the regime (N=3) while keeping lead time estimate derived from observed arrivals. This keeps base-stock responsive to the lower recent demand and avoids excess holding given profit=19 vs holding=1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods (orders in P1-P3 and P5 arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows mixed signals: earlier baseline mean ~81.8 (Jan samples), a brief low patch around P1-P3, then two strong spikes in P4-P5 (121,145). However the recent high-demand pattern is only 2 periods (not yet 3+), so avoid declaring a sustained regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost, keep L as default (0) so the model treats arrivals same-period; use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.4) to tilt the forecast toward recent higher demand while still retaining historical weight; keep sigma_hat default to reflect overall historical volatility. This approach provides moderate uplift to base_stock to cover recent spikes without overreacting to a potentially short-lived surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1657.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6) are 121,145,93 \u2014 materially higher than the earlier low-regime signal. On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). To react to the recent uptick while keeping fast replenishment, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 4-6 mean \u2248 119.7) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases orders to protect service level (high profit vs low holding cost) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded demands show a sustained lower regime (recent 3 concluded periods demand avg=34.3 vs prior avg\u224881.8). On-hand=129, in-transit=0, so current coverage is high vs recent demand; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime (places the base stock around the new mean\xd7(1+L) and scales uncertainty to recent volatility). This reduces excess holding while preserving service for the new lower demand level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=175, in-transit=0. History shows actual lead_time observed=0 in all concluded arrivals. A sustained lower-demand regime was recorded earlier (Period 4) and recent sales remain muted; therefore keep promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to adapt to the lowered regime (use N=3 per detected regime length). This yields responsive demand forecast and volatility for the OR backend, avoiding overstock while respecting high profit vs low holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=144, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each arrival\u2014use default promised L=0. Recent demand has shifted down: last 3 concluded periods (Periods 7-9 demands = 34, 8, 31 => low regime). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower recent mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std will be computed by backend). This reduces ordering compared to using the full-sample mean and limits holding cost while preserving service given current low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0; recent demand appears in a lower regime (carry-over insight). I use default L (promised 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (uses the most recent 3 concluded demand observations) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and safety stock to the new lower mean and volatility, reducing overstock while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0, so use promised lead time. A sustained demand down-shift was previously identified at Period 4 and persists; to capture the recent lower-demand regime I set demand estimates using recent data. Choose L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 (covers the regime since Period 4 through latest concluded periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock to reduce holding costs while preserving service under the sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent concluded demand has fallen vs original sample average; carry-over notes a sustained regime shift to lower demand. On-hand=138, in-transit=0 \u2014 healthy cover for short lead time. Use L=default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0. For demand forecast use recent_N N=3 to reflect the new low-demand regime (protects against overstock). Use sigma recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders down to avoid holding cost while maintaining service given current inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has been much lower (most recent 3 concluded demands = 19,10,3; avg\u224810.7) and previous carry-over noted a sustained drop; to avoid excess holding cost I set demand forecast using the most recent 3 periods. Sigma also estimated from the same recent 3-period regime to reflect reduced volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. On-hand=133, in-transit=0 (ample cover today). Historical concluded lead times all 0 -> use promised/default L=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 11-14: 19,10,3,2) average=8.5, indicating a new low-demand regime vs earlier samples. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low mean and reduced volatility, which reduces target base-stock and holding risk while preserving service for the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 (2019-04-22 to 2019-05-13): recent avg=8.5 vs prior recent avg=34.3 (\u2248-75%); treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has fallen and stayed low: Periods 11-15 demands = [19,10,3,2,3], recent avg \u22487.4 vs earlier higher regime. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand is high (130) with zero in-transit. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime while respecting observed zero lead time, I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the last 5 periods. This biases orders toward the low current demand, avoiding unnecessary replenishment and reducing holding cost while the backend's service-level cap still applies.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently (orders that arrived show lead_time=0). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 11 (carry-over insight): recent weeks show generally low demand with one large spike in Period 16 (68) that appears singular. To balance service level (profit $19) vs holding cost ($1), I use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine assumes L=0, and I set demand estimates using recent data to capture the low-regime mean but still allow volatility from the recent spike. Therefore: L=default; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (captures the last five demand samples including the latest spike to avoid understocking if spike recurs).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Concluded history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time for arrived orders\u2014no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand is volatile: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13-17) = [3,2,3,68,22], reflecting a low-demand regime punctuated by a spike in Period 16. To balance service vs holding cost I use a short recent window to capture the current mixed regime while avoiding overreaction to a single spike.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent history shows a downward demand regime since spring but with intermittent spikes (recent demands: P14-18 = [2,3,68,22,2]). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. I keep L at promised (default) since evidence strongly confirms 0-period lead time. To capture the most relevant recent mean and variability while smoothing over one spike, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples). This focuses the OR backend on current lower-demand regime while still reflecting recent volatility, balancing service level and holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding ($1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Carry-over identified a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 11 (2019-04-22) to a lower mean (~8.5) continuing through recent periods. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (regime length from Period 11\u201319 = 9) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given confirmed lower demand while keeping service for current period demand.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals list lead_time 0), so set L by calculate (avg observed lead_time=0). Demand has shifted down materially in prior carry-over insights; most recent 3 concluded demands = [2,4,3] (Periods 18-20) averaging ~3 units, so use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime and keep inventory lean. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current low volatility. These choices reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the low recent demand; they also account for 1+L review horizon with L inferred as 0.

Demand has shown sustained down-shifts earlier (carry-over notes) but recent volatility includes a large spike (Period 22 demand=104). To balance service vs. holding cost I use a short recent window to capture the current regime and recent spike: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine adapts to the most recent demand pattern while limiting influence of older higher-demand periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shows a recent uptick (Period demands: P19..P23 = 4,3,28,104,111) indicating regime change vs earlier low-demand regime. To capture this recent volatility and elevated mean, set L to default (promised 0) and forecast demand using recent_N over the last 5 concluded demand observations (N=5). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent variance. These parameters let the OR backend increase the base-stock to cover the recent spike while quantifying higher volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given current spikes) against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Recent three periods (P22-P24: demands 104,111,100) show a clear high-demand spike vs prior low-demand regime; shipments historically conclude with lead_time=0. Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent elevated demand (Periods 21-24: 28,104,111,100) while smoothing one adjacent lower week. This raises the base stock to protect service during the confirmed spike while sigma from recent variability tightens safety stock to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 22 (2019-07-08 to 2019-07-22): avg demand P22-24=105.0 vs prior recent avg (P17-21)=23.4 (+349%); treat as sustained until contradicted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Recent demand spike since Period 22 (demands P22-P25 = 104,111,100,91; recent avg\u2248101.5) appears sustained through Period 25. Promised lead time and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default lead time to keep model aligned with promised behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean over last 4 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices steer the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed spike while letting the backend cap order size via its cap formula.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent weeks show a clear, sustained demand spike beginning Period 22 (2019-07-08) \u2014 five consecutive high-demand periods (P22-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the new high regime. Lead time observed consistently as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. For demand forecasting use recent_N over the confirmed spike regime (N=5, periods 22-26) to capture the elevated mean; match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher base stock to avoid lost sales during the sustained spike while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed starting Period 22: avg P22-26=104.4 vs prior P17-21=11.8 (+786%), treat as sustained until contradicted.

Lead times historically conclude as 0 consistently. No overdue or missing shipments. I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 6 weeks). These parameters bias the base-stock toward the elevated demand while keeping holding cost modest (holding $1 vs profit $19).

Lead times historically concluded as 0 periods, so keep L as default. To capture the recent sustained spike starting P22, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length P22-28 = 7) so the OR engine forecasts elevated mean and volatility and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so use default lead time. Recent sustained demand regime: spike beginning Period 22 (Jul) with high weekly demand through Period 29; choose recent_N for demand estimates to capture this new higher regime. Regime length = Periods 22\u201329 (8 weeks) so N=8. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the elevated recent mean and observed volatility, helping the OR engine set higher replenishment targets while limiting overstock from older low-demand periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained spike) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand spike since Period 22: last 5 concluded demands (P26-P30) = [116,123,103,98,74], avg\u2248102.8, much higher than earlier regimes. All concluded lead times = 0 so default promised lead time remains valid. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on most recent 5 weeks). This increases target base-stock to meet the sustained spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. L left as default to reflect observed 0-period lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 22 (2019-07-08) and has remained high for P22\u2013P31 (demands: 104,111,100,91,116,123,103,98,74,69; avg\u224899). To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using the last 10 samples. This focuses orders on the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping holding risk limited given low holding cost.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To capture the current high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (regime length P22\u2013P33 = 12) so the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this raises base stock to protect service while the 0 lead time keeps pipeline short to limit holding cost.

To be responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single extreme, I use default lead time (promised=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 4 weeks (recent_N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current realized demand volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in history arrived same period). Recent demand is variable (last 5 concluded demands: P32-P36 = 53,138,75,20,7) showing elevated volatility and a mix of high spikes and low weeks. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times confirm it, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and current volatility so the optimizer balances service level (profit per unit high, holding cost low) against holding cost without overreacting to single-week spikes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has returned to a low regime after summer spikes; on-hand=141, in-transit=0 so current inventory is ample. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so use default promised lead time. To reflect recent low demand while still allowing responsiveness to short upticks, set mu_hat using an EWMA (gamma=0.5) to weight recent weeks more heavily; set sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 concluded demand samples to capture current volatility. These choices reduce order quantities versus long-run averages, lowering holding cost while preserving service for short-run demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=138, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 34-38: 75,20,7,3,3) indicating a downshift versus earlier seasonal spikes; however spikes occurred in Jul-Aug and were recorded as carry-over insights. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To reflect the recent low demand regime while still smoothing noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 concluded periods). This biases the base-stock toward current low demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for short-term demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show low demand (Periods 35-39: 20,7,3,3,3) but history has earlier high-volatility spikes; no new sustained regime change confirmed. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. To balance service vs holding cost I'll trust promised lead time and historical demand stats: use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the optimizer set base-stock and cap given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). SKU 719957006 on-hand=115, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand has mostly been low (many weeks with 2\u20137 units) with occasional spikes earlier in summer; no new 3+ period sustained regime shift since the last recorded insights. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) the OR backend should target a high service level. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L), respectively\u2014this avoids overreacting to single-week variations and leverages the long historical series while the carry-over record already captures past sustained shifts. This balances service (high fill rate) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 for all observed arrivals, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand shows mostly very low weekly sales in Oct\u2013Nov (3,3,3,20) but a large spike in Period 41 (135) created stockout; this spike is currently a single-period event and not yet a sustained regime change. To balance service (cover short-term spike risk) while avoiding excess holding given low baseline, I use a recent_N demand estimate using the last 5 concluded periods to capture both the recent low baseline and the recent spike. Use the same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings let the OR backend increase target stock modestly to tolerate the observed volatility without reverting to the high summer stocking policy.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows two very large demands (P41=135, P42=308) after several low-demand periods; full sample displays earlier sustained summer spike and later low regime per carry-over. Actual observed lead times have been 0 throughout. To balance service vs holding cost while reacting to recent demand lift, set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to weight the last 5 weeks (captures emerging uplift without overreacting to a single outlier). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This ensures pipeline targets the near-term increase while keeping holding exposure moderate.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=224, in-transit=0. Recent history shows large but short-lived demand spikes around Periods 41-42 (Black Friday week), but the spike is not yet a sustained 3+ period regime change. All concluded lead-time observations are 0 periods. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time=0). I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), avoiding overreacting to the recent transient spike while letting the optimizer incorporate long-run demand and measured variability. This balances service level (capture occasional peaks) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-16. History shows actual lead time consistently 0 (arrivals always same-period in concluded messages). On-hand=141, in-transit=0; recent weeks (P40-P44) show elevated and volatile demand (peak 308 then 87,83). To capture the recent demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed data, set L=default (promised=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to weight the last 5 demand samples and reflect the recent spike. Keep sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for recent elevated demand while avoiding overfitting variance.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=108, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained December demand spike (Periods 41-45). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (observed lead_times = 0); use default L to let OR engine assume same-period arrival. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime (Periods 41\u201345) so the base-stock and cap reflect the holiday spike and avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 41\u201345 (2019-11-18 to 2019-12-16) avg demand=145.6 vs prior 5-period avg (P36\u201340)=36.0 (+305%); treat as sustained seasonal peak until contradicted.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Given high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) (high target service level) and no new sustained changepoint since the documented seasonal peak, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance (which captures seasonality from history) while the large on-hand position reduces immediate stockout risk.
