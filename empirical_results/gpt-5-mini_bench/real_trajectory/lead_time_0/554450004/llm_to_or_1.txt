Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 554450004 (women's skinny denim). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed yet so no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean \u224878.6 units/week and moderate variability. Promised lead time will be used (default) and demand estimates will use the full-sample defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (use full-history mean) versus holding cost given modest holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Promised L=0; observed arrival from Period 1 confirms actual lead time = 0 (order placed P1 arrived P1). Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) have mean ~78.6; Period 1 demand=126 is a single high outlier but not a sustained shift (only one period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we rely on OR engine baseline. Therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend uses the full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to a one-period spike while still letting the capped ordering rule control order size.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Recent concluded periods show demand surged to 126 for two consecutive weeks vs historical Jan samples (72,81,71,78,91) \u2014 possible regime shift but not yet 3+ periods of evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (both concluded arrivals show lead_time=0) to confirm lead time=0. Use EWMA (gamma=0.6) for mu_hat to weight the recent high demands while still blending historical data. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including the two high-demand periods and the nearest prior sample. These choices adapt quickly to higher demand while avoiding overcommitment given limited evidence of a sustained shift; they help the OR backend set a higher base stock but keep cap constrained to limit holding cost risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1935.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained upward shift: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = 126, 126, 104 versus historical Jan samples ~72\u201391. On-hand=41, in-transit=0; no outstanding arrivals visible. Lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded arrivals (P1\u2192arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3). I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 3 concluded periods 126,126,104). This raises the base-stock forecast to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility from these recent samples, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11\u20132019-02-25: avg increased from 78.6 to 118.7 (+51%)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded demands: P1=126, P2=126, P3=104, P4=86; on-hand=54, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have been 0 in all concludes, so keep L at promised (0). Demand shows a higher recent regime vs older winter samples but has softened in P4; to capture the most up-to-date demand level I use a recent_N estimate over the last 4 concluded periods (N=4) so mu_hat reflects the 1-period expected demand ~110.5 while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given recent elevated demand) against holding cost by not using the larger longer-term sample that would push inventory much higher.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1637.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent weeks show higher demand since the regime shift noted starting 2019-02-11 (weeks in Periods 1\u20135: 126,126,104,86,89) \u2014 overall recent average elevated vs. older baseline. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P5 arrived same period). On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time consistently 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 5 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock toward current demand while keeping holding cost modest (Holding=$1) and leveraging confirmed 0 lead time to avoid over-ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use calculate to reflect observed lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-02-11 with variable weekly demand; to capture this recent regime I use recent_N with N=6 (the last 6 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes the base stock to current demand level while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) shows every concluded arrival was same-period: observed lead_time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 3\u20137 = 104,86,89,114,86) appears to represent the current regime (stable ~96 mean after earlier shift). To balance service level vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high service target), I set L to the calculated observed lead time (0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime mean over the last 5 periods and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current demand level while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost and no in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last period had a large demand spike (143) and several prior high weeks. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L by calculating observed average. Demand regime shifted upward earlier (noted in history); to keep responsiveness to recent variability I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (captures the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect current sales pace while smoothing one-off spikes). These parameters increase target base-stock to support service during higher recent demand while sigma_hat from recent data informs safety stock to limit overstock given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand after the Feb regime shift noted earlier; on-hand=79, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed arrived same period), so set L based on observed lead times. I select L="calculate" to confirm actual lead time=0 from history. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift mean and current volatility (recent demands: 114,86,143,88,66). This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent mean while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). Recent_N=5 balances responsiveness and sample stability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has trended down from a March/early-April spike (noted earlier) to the last five periods: [86,143,88,66,51] (mean=86.8). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use promised/default lead time to avoid introducing bias. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime length of 5 weeks). This keeps base-stock aligned to shorter-run demand and reduces overstock risk given holding cost is low but nonzero (Profit=$19, Holding=$1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=73, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times all 0, so set L using calculate (avg observed lead time=0). Recent demand has moved lower versus the earlier spike; I use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the recent regime (last 5 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the most recent demand pattern while avoiding overstock from earlier high-demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Demand shows a prior regime shift noted in carry-over (higher mean around Feb), but the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 9\u201313 demands: 88,66,51,72,64) suggest a lower recent mean; use recent_N=5 to capture current run-rate while keeping pipeline coverage (1+L) periods. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given ample on-hand (79) and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed lead_times = 0 (orders repeatedly arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201314 = 66,51,72,64,73) appears stable around ~65 units; to adapt to current regime while avoiding overstock I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5). Volatility also set from the same recent window (N=5) to reflect current variability. No overdue or lost shipments detected.

Recent demand (last 5 weeks: 51,72,64,73,65) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier spike; use recent_N=5 to center forecast on current run-rate and limit inventory/hc exposure. mu_hat uses recent_N to target (1+L)*mean of recent 5; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. This balances service (cover current-week demand) against holding cost given slim margin (profit $19 vs holding $1). No new sustained lead-time or seasonal insight detected.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand since the noted Feb regime shift has been lower than the early-Feb spike; use a recent-window estimate to capture the post-shift regime. I select L=default to respect promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (regime length since the Feb changepoint \u224813 periods) so the OR engine bases base-stock and cap on the current lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while preserving service.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent observed demand has trended down from the earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands = [64,73,65,52,41] (mean 59). On-hand=82, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time historical evidence confirms 0 periods. To avoid excess holding given low holding cost but reduced recent demand, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent lower-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward current lower demand while allowing the OR backend cap to limit extreme orders.

No concluded late/lost shipments (all observed lead_times=0). I keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat via EWMA to emphasize recent downtrend while retaining some memory (EWMA_gamma=0.3). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current reduced volatility from the last 5 observations. These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given falling demand while preserving service through modest safety stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=14, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Recent demand has settled well below the early-season peak \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 15\u201319): [65,52,41,37,51], mean=49.2, showing a sustained lower-demand regime versus earlier spike. All observed lead times = 0 historically. To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, I choose L=default (promised 0), set mu_hat to recent_N to reflect the recent lower mean (N=5), and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This supplies the OR engine with a shorter, lower forecast and tighter volatility estimate, reducing overstock risk given current on-hand inventory.

To let the OR backend use full historical demand stats and the promised lead time, I choose default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so base-stock and caps are computed from all samples and promised lead time.

Recent demand is variable but no sustained new regime since the last recorded carry-over insight; holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19, so aim to rely on long-run demand estimates. Use default lead time (promised), and default demand mean/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) so the OR engine can set base-stock balancing service level and holding cost while respecting caps.

Demand showed a sustained upward regime starting 2019-02-11 (noted in carry-over), so base stock should reflect recent demand rather than older low samples; use recent_N (N=20) to compute mu_hat (covers the most recent 20 demand observations to capture the post-changepoint regime). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from a short window. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while using conservative volatility for service/holding tradeoff.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 0 periods (orders in history always arrived same-period). Recent demand (late June\u2013July) has shown elevated and volatile levels (several weeks >100). To capture the most recent regime while smoothing noise, I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend bases base_stock on the latest 8 weeks. L kept at default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time and no overdue/lost shipments.

Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand (Periods 21-25) averaged high (~96,132,142,99,92 \u2192 avg \u2248112) vs earlier baseline ~78. Given consistent zero observed lead times in concluded history, keep L = promised (default). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 periods: P21-P25). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; no evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Historical conclues show actual lead time consistently 0. To cover the current high-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L to promised (default=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the most recent ~6-week high-demand regime: Periods 21\u201326) so the OR backend raises target base-stock and reflects recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 21-27) is elevated: demands = [96,132,142,99,92,136,180], recent mean \u2248124 vs long-run mean \u224879 (historic early-2019). No evidence of changed lead time (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To protect service while avoiding excess inventory given profit=$19 and holding=$1, I use recent_N=7 for demand mean/volatility to capture the sustained higher regime in Jul\u2013Aug. L uses default (promised 0). sigma_hat uses recent_N=7 to reflect recent variability and allow the OR engine to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent weeks (Periods 24\u201328) show substantially higher demand (99,92,136,180,167; recent mean \u2248134.8) vs earlier periods \u2014 I will base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current high-demand regime and keep lead time as promised (0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 focuses the OR engine on current demand volatility and level, reducing stockouts while accepting modest additional holding cost given profit >> holding cost. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments to adjust L.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand 66, in-transit 0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 26-29: 136,180,167,134) is elevated vs earlier baseline; I treat this as a sustained higher-demand regime over the last ~4\u20138 weeks and therefore shrink the forecast window to recent data. I set L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus the OR engine on recent elevated demand (covers the recent spike while smoothing a bit). This raises base_stock to improve fill rates while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety buffer; the OR backend will cap order size as usual to limit over-ordering given holding cost ($1/unit). On-hand + pipeline (66) is low relative to recent weekly demand (~150), so using recent_N increases recommended orders to avoid stockouts while limiting long-term holding cost by relying on observed 0 lead time.

Recent demand (most recent 5 concluded periods) shows a higher regime (demands = 167,134,165,206,142; mean \u2248162.8) vs longer-run average, so set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals pending and no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201333) has been persistently higher than earlier weeks, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window to capture the current regime (N=8 covers the seven most recent high-demand weeks plus the immediate prior week). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend increases base-stock to protect service level during this sustained upswing while the capped order limits prevent excessive holding costs given holding=$1/unit. Using recent_N balances responsiveness to the elevated demand regime with the backend cap to control inventory risk.

No recent multi-period evidence of a new demand regime beyond the previously recorded Feb shift. Given stable confirmed lead time and ample history, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) using the backend's z* calculation while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1686.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in concluded periods) and no missing shipments; on-hand=81, in-transit=0. Demand history through Period 36 shows variable weekly demand but no new sustained regime since the previously recorded Feb 2019 shift. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm 0. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1. This avoids overfitting recent noise while the conclude history confirms lead-time stability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (no lost/late shipments observed). Recent history shows no new sustained demand regime shifts beyond the one already recorded in carry-over. Inventory is adequate for near-term demand but with zero pipeline; maintain default statistical forecast so the OR backend uses full sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. Methods chosen (default/default/default) let the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, providing a high service level given high profit vs holding cost while avoiding manual overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-11-04. On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders always arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated since the Feb regime shift and shows substantial variability through summer/autumn; to capture the current regime and recent volatility, I use recent_N=20 for both demand mean and std (covers most recent data up to Period 38). This yields mu_hat scaled for (1+L) using recent sample mean so the OR base-stock targets current demand levels while sigma_hat from recent volatility keeps safety stock responsive but not excessive given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). No overdue shipments to account for (arrived history consistent), so L stays default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $959.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=143, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand regime (noted earlier) is materially higher than the small 2019-Jan sample; to capture current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N over a multi-week window. This ensures mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent variability so the OR backend sets a base-stock aligned to current demand while avoiding excessive holding given Holding=$1/unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current sellable on-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand has varied but no new sustained regime since the previous recorded shift (Feb 2019). Given stable confirmed lead time=0 and ample on-hand stock, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while letting the backend cap orders vs. pipeline.

Recent demand shows volatility (notably Period 42 spike to 204) but no confirmed sustained new regime since the previously recorded shift. To avoid overreacting to the single sharp recent spike, use default lead time and default demand estimates based on the full sample history so the OR backend uses the long-run mean/variance. This balances service level against holding cost given current zero inventory and no confirmed new pattern.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (orders arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoints since the listed carry-over insight (Period 4). Current on-hand inventory (129) provides buffer versus recent weekly demand variability, so select default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise and balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Demand history shows mixed weeks including recent high variance but no new sustained shift since prior carry-over. To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), use default estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std (conservative service with observed demand history) while avoiding manual overreaction to recent volatility. Default L keeps lead-time assumption at promised 0; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let backend use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods and no recent shipment losses; demand history across 2019 shows variable weekly demand but no new sustained regime after the previously recorded Period 4 insight. Use promised/default lead time (0) since concluded lead-times are consistently 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level (profit $19 vs hold $1) with holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory and no in-transit coverage needed.
