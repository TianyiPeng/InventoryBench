Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~70 units and a mild downward trend but only 5 samples \u2014 not enough to declare a sustained regime change. On-hand and in-transit are 0. Promised lead time default (0) is used. Use default demand estimates (all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full history; this balances service level (profit/holding cost ratio implies moderate service target) without overreacting to a short apparent dip and avoids risking excess inventory given zero starting stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded arrival shows orders placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (observed lead_time=0). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean ~70.2, std ~17.8. I confirm lead time = 0 via observed data and use demand population stats (default) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility accordingly. This balances service (use full-sample mean) with low holding cost by not inflating demand forecasts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows two observed lead times = 0 (orders placed P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time 0). Demand history: provided historical weekly samples (100,66,70,62,53) and recent realized demands in concluded periods (41,107). To balance service and holding cost I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (captures confirmed 0 lead-time signals). For demand level I use a recent_N (N=5) mean to emphasize the most recent weekly samples while smoothing older noise; sigma_hat left as default so the OR engine uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This set keeps base-stock responsive to recent demand without overstating variance, and avoids overstocking given high holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2013.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand jumped to 107 and 106 in the last two concluded periods after a 41 unit week; this suggests a recent uptick. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead times in concludes are 0. To react quickly to the recent higher demand while keeping holding costs low, I use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent weeks (including the surge) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 so sigma_hat reflects recent demand variability. This prioritizes service level given the recent high sales while keeping inventory exposure aligned with current variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1513.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows all arrivals with lead_time=0 (consistent with promised L=0). Recent realized weekly demand has varied but no sustained regime shift (only 4 periods). Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimators so backend uses all samples: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level given steady evidence of same-period arrivals while avoiding overreacting to short sample spikes.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent observed demands (Periods 1-5 conclude): 41,107,106,83,71 \u2014 mean ~81.6; on-hand=45, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. All concluded lead times = 0, so use promised lead time. To capture recent weekly demand behavior I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the latest regime. This balances service (captures recent high-demand spikes in P2\u2013P3) against holding cost given current modest on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). Recent demand: P4=83, P5=71, P6=147 \u2014 a sharp uptick in P6. I set L to calculate (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to adapt to the recent higher demand regime (captures P4\u2013P6 average and variance). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the observed spike while keeping holding cost considerations tied to the recent variance.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand shows a clear upward shift vs. the earlier sample set: last 3 demands = {71,147,177} with mean \u2248131.7 vs. historical mean \u224870.2. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. To react to the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding, I set L by calculate (backend will confirm avg observed lead time=0), and use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the new regime and tighten responsiveness versus using older low-demand data. This raises the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while the capped order cap limits extreme orders and controls holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting recent periods: historical avg \u224870.2 -> recent 3-week avg \u2248131.7 (+~88%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has shifted up: historical mean ~70.2 vs recent 3-week avg ~131.7 (sustained 3 periods). To cover review+lead demand and keep service high while controlling holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect new regime; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand has shifted up vs. historical Jan-Feb baseline: last 3 realised demands (Periods 7-9) = {177,101,85}, recent 3-week avg \u2248121.0 vs historical ~70. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. On-hand=120, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment sized to the new higher demand regime; using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the post-change mean and volatility while keeping responsiveness high to avoid stockouts and limit excess holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift since Period 8 (three periods: 101,85,84). On-hand=118, in-transit=0 so current inventory roughly covers ~1.3 weeks at new demand. I set L='calculate' to use observed lead times (all concluded lead_times=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (avoids dilution by prior low-demand periods). Sigma also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the new regime while avoiding excess safety stock from older data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals in concluded history (all observed lead_times=0). Recent demand regime increase detected around Period 8 (sustained ~3 periods previously). To protect service given zero inventory and higher recent demand, keep L as promised (default=0) and use recent 3-period demand to capture the elevated regime for both mean and volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean while sigma from recent 3 periods captures current variability; balances higher fill-rate (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical base-week demands (Jan samples) averaged ~70, but recent carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift (recent 3 weeks avg \u2248131.7). Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so use default L. To respond to the confirmed higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the new regime length =3 periods per carry-over rule). This raises the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to improve service vs. holding tradeoff given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Recent demand shows a post-spike normalization; use recent_N (N=5) to let mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 9-13) so orders match current demand and avoid excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been elevated vs early historical baseline but recent weeks show moderated but still-higher demand (last 5 concluded demands: 84,120,94,67,74; mean=87.8). To respond to the sustained higher regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and updated volatility. This balances service versus holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

A demand regime shift was previously detected starting Period 8 with a sustained higher mean; recent demand remains elevated. To respond, keep L as default (promised=0) since arrivals historically match promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 3 weeks (captures the sustained higher-demand regime). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in prior periods all arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Demand has shifted upward starting Period 8 and sustained; to capture the recent higher regime I base demand forecast on the most recent 9 periods (Period 8\u201316) to cover the full post-changepoint regime. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=9) so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the higher mean and updated volatility while L=default keeps lead-time assumption at 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has shifted higher since Period 8 and the last 3 weeks (Periods 15-17: 117,138,154; avg\u2248136) showing a sustained elevated regime. Promised lead time historically observed as 0. To protect service while limiting holding cost, keep L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This ensures base_stock and cap are computed from the most recent regime rather than long-run low-demand history.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Recent demand regime (noted in carry-over) shows a sustained uplift vs. historical (~3-period avg \u2248140 units vs. historical ~70). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 we must cover current-period demand after decision. I set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded lead times = 0. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the confirmed elevated demand regime (periods 16-18 demands = 138,154,129; recent mean \u2248140) so the OR base-stock accounts for the new higher demand. I use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices favor service (reduce stockouts) given the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical on-time arrivals show promised lead time=0 confirmed repeatedly. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 (sustained elevated weekly sales). To capture the new regime I use recent_N=12 (regime length Periods 8\u201319 = 12) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent elevated demand. L kept as default (promised lead time=0) because concluded messages repeatedly show lead_time=0. These settings raise the base-stock to meet current higher demand while sigma recent estimate informs safety stock to balance fill rate vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat via recent_N using the last 5 weeks to weight the current elevated mean; set sigma_hat via recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR base-stock toward meeting elevated demand while the recent-N sigma tightens service-level calculation to avoid excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Recent demand has been higher and volatile vs earlier regime (sustained elevated demand since the regime shift identified earlier). To prioritize service while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time (default=0) and use recent demand for forecasting: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility. I choose N=14 (regime begun around Period 8; recent regime length \u224814 weeks through Period 21). These parameters ensure the OR backend targets base stock reflecting the new higher demand and higher safety stock while capping order size.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand regime elevated since Period 8 (three-periods sustained earlier and continued high demand through Period 22). On-hand=72, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime since Period 8 (regime length = 15 weeks \u2192 N=15). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat toward the elevated recent mean/volatility, improving service (reduce stockouts) while OR backend will cap orders; holding cost is low relative to profit so prioritizing service is appropriate.

Use promised lead time (observed LT=0 historically). For forecasts favor recent data to capture the new regime: set mu_hat via recent_N using last 5 weeks to reflect current higher mean; set sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in higher-demand regime) against holding cost by relying on short-window estimates.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 22-24 = 113, 79, 87) averages ~93 units/week; this recent regime is more reflective than the long-run older samples. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (responding to elevated recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 8 (recent 3-week avg \u2248131.7), so I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. No evidence of lead-time change (concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0). Therefore: keep L=default (promised 0), set mu_hat using recent_N to reflect the recent regime (N=3), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while accounting for holding cost via backend tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (no sustained delays or lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 24-26 = 87,83,60) shows no new sustained upward regime beyond earlier recorded shift, so use default statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time. Choosing default L uses promised lead time=0; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short recent variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand last 3 periods = [83, 60, 57], recent 3-week mean \u224866.7 (down from earlier spike recorded in carry-over). To avoid overstock given holding cost and current healthy on-hand, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures current lower regime). Volatility has also fallen recently, so set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while honoring the confirmed earlier regime note in carry-over.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a sustained regime shift upward first flagged at Period 8 and recent weeks remain elevated with volatile demand (recent demands: Period26=60, Period27=57, Period28=178). No evidence of lead-time drift in concluded history (all observed lead_time=0). I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (focus on the latest 3 weeks to reflect the new mean). Demand volatility also appears elevated, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward higher coverage for near-term demand while keeping lead-time assumption at promised level since concluded arrivals show lead_time=0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use promised lead time (default). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime vs early-year baseline (user carry-over noted); to capture the recent demand level and variability I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to cover the latest demand pattern while limiting overstating variability from older low-demand weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts from elevated demand) against holding cost given zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods. The carry-over insight notes a sustained demand regime shift (started around Period 8) with recent weeks materially higher. To react to the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent demands = 178, 248, 131) so mu_hat reflects the short-term elevated mean. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q-based safety stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=206, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand average ~70.2 (early history) but recent 3 weeks show elevated demand (~131.7 avg) and this spike has persisted for 3 periods (Periods 29-31 demand: 248,131,77? actually 29-31 are 248,131,77 \u2014 but carry-over insight identified recent 3-week avg \u2248131.7). Given sustained higher recent demand, use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new regime. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat using recent 3-week mean scaled by (1+L) to target the new demand level; set sigma_hat using recent 3-week volatility to reflect increased uncertainty. These choices bias orders toward higher service (capture higher recent demand) while sigma_hat informs safety stocking to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=196, in-transit=0. Historical baseline demand (~70/week) shifted upward earlier (noted in carry-over). Recent observed weekly demands (Periods 28-32): [178,248,131,77,100], recent mean \u2248146.8 indicating the higher regime persists. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime while keeping variability estimation responsive, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covers the most recent 5 weeks). This provides the OR backend with a (1+L)-period demand forecast and updated volatility to balance service level (higher stock to meet increased demand) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

To react to the confirmed higher recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed history (arrivals historically showed lead_time=0), I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the elevated recent mean over the next (1+L) review+lead period. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent increased volatility and avoid understocking. This balances higher service (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost by limiting lookback to the most relevant recent regime.

Historical weekly demand has been volatile; recent 5-week demand (Periods 31-35 = 77,100,191,83,59) averages ~102, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Promised lead time and observed concluded lead times have been 0 historically, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to make (1+L)\xd7mean reflect the latest demand level; set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) so safety stock matches recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1972.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Recent demand has been variable (last 8 weeks: 131,77,100,191,83,59,108,80 sold patterns) with no new sustained shift beyond the previously recorded regime change. On-hand=80, in-transit=0 so available cover is low for immediate demand; promised lead time has historically concluded as 0 periods across many periods. I therefore use default lead time (trust promised 0), and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to full historical data while the backend's capped order policy limits extreme replenishment; defaults balance service vs holding cost given no new sustained evidence to override the prior regime insight.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical baseline demand ~70 (Jan samples) but recent periods show elevated demand (recent 5-week avg \u2248113.8; recent surge observed since Period 28 and sustained). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised/default L. To respond to the sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the elevated regime; sigma_hat uses recent-N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean \u224870/week (early 2019) but a sustained higher-demand regime began around Period 8; recent weeks show elevated demand (recent avg ~100+). Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so use default L to reflect observed same-period arrivals. To capture the persistent higher-demand regime while using recent data, set mu_hat with recent_N on the last 8 weeks (balances responsiveness and noise). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher demand (improving fill rates) while sigma based on recent variability prevents overstocking given $1 holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. A demand regime shift was previously identified beginning at Period 8 and has persisted; to capture the new higher-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate. Regime length since Period 8 through current period \u224832 weeks; per rules I cap N at 20, so N=20. Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while limiting overstock risk given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been on a higher regime since Period 8 (carry-over noted): recent weeks show materially higher sales vs. the historical pre-shift mean. On-hand=83, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty and we must cover current period demand plus lead time. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0; therefore use default promised L=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 20 weeks (recent_N N=20) which balances responsiveness and variance estimation for the OR backend. This raises the base-stock (service level) to avoid stockouts under the new regime while the sigma estimate scales safety stock appropriately given elevated variability. No evidence of new lead-time shifts or lost shipments in concluded history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. Observed sustained higher-demand regime vs early-sample mean (~70 \u2192 ~120+). On-hand=61, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) periods. All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so keep L=default. Use recent_N for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the new higher regime; choose N=5 (most recent 5 weeks, mean \u2248119.8) to reflect current demand while remaining responsive. Using recent demand reduces stockouts under the elevated regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility for service-level sizing.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 (previous carry-over insight). To reflect the sustained higher demand and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with a 20-period window (captures the post-changepoint regime while respecting the N caps). This increases target base-stock to raise service while the OR backend caps orders; using recent data balances profit vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=157, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show variability (e.g., 95,121,141,174,42) but no new 3+ period sustained shift beyond previously recorded insight. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm 0 in past periods. Profit=$19, Holding=$1 implies a high target service level (q=0.95) which the OR backend will translate into a high z. I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend uses the full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this balances the high service-level objective (capture sales) against holding costs while avoiding overreacting to recent noisy weeks. No in-transit stock to cover the next period, so defaults let the OR engine compute the appropriate base-stock/order given its cap logic.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=145, in-transit=0. Historical series shows mostly 0 promised lead_time with confirmed arrivals at 0 in concluded periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 121,141,174,42,39) is volatile and likely influenced by early-December drop; to capture recent regime and short-term variability I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility. Use default lead time (promised=0) since observed lead times have consistently been 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=153, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand (Periods 43-45 = 42,39,50) is well below earlier peaks and current on-hand is ample; no new sustained changepoint detected that would justify increasing forecast or safety stock. Use default demand and volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level (via backend z* from profit/holding) against holding cost given current high inventory and no evidence of a new upward regime.

Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default to match observed behavior. To reflect the recent December demand drop and avoid overstocking given low holding cost tradeoff, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 demand observations to adapt forecast/volatility to current low-demand regime). This balances high service target (profit/holding \u2192 high q) with current subdued demand to reduce unnecessary holding costs.
