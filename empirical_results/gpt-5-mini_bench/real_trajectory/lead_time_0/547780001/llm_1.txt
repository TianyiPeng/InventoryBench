Demand drivers: winter season supports steady demand; no immediate calendar spikes in mid-February for this basic SKU.

Recent 5-week average \u224874.6 units/week with volatility (range 57\u2013121) and one high outlier (121 on 2019-01-07). Lead time & pipeline: promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; orders may arrive same period or be delayed/lost. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Economics: Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period (low holding cost relative to profit) \u2014 favors stocking to capture sales. Decision logic: aim to cover ~1\u20132 weeks of expected demand while limiting exposure to LT uncertainty and one high outlier. I choose a conservative safety uplift (~+25%) over the recent mean: 75 * 1.25 \u224894.
