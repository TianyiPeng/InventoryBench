Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and only five weekly demand samples available through 2019-02-04. No concluded arrivals to infer lead time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and aggregate historical demand: mean demand = 41.4 units/week, std \u2248 7.5. Choose L=default so backend uses promised lead time; choose mu_hat=default to base (1+L)\xd7mean on all samples; choose sigma_hat=default to reflect observed variability. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while avoiding overreacting to limited data or unobserved shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (38,31,51,38,49) mean=41.4. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). Current on-hand=3, in-transit=0 \u2014 far below expected one-period demand. No evidence of lead-time drift or sustained regime change, so use promised/default lead time and demand estimates based on all samples to drive the OR backend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in P1 and P2 both arrived same period (observed lead times = 0), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand: P1 demand=39, P2 demand=54; historical sample mean\u224841.4 with no sustained (>3 periods) regime shift\u2014use population defaults for demand and volatility so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (cover typical demand) vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands: P1=39, P2=54, P3=33; historical weekly samples (5): 38,31,51,38,49. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Lead time evidence: three consecutive concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set L via "calculate" to let backend confirm average observed lead time (expected 0). Demand forecast uses recent_N N=5 to weight the most recent 5 weekly samples (combines historical + recent weeks) so mu_hat reflects current short-run demand variability; sigma_hat kept as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices keep service (low promised lead time) while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Profit: $27.00, Daily Holding Cost: $16.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demands (Periods 1-4) = [39,54,33,27], mean=38.25. On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, and there is no sustained changepoint in demand (no 3+ period shift). I use default L to keep promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the latest four observed weekly demands and capture current volatility; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to match variability observed over the same window. These settings keep the OR base-stock focused on the most recent demand pattern while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized lead time is consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20135 arrivals same period). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; recent demand (Periods 1\u20135) = [39,54,33,27,34], mean=37.4. I use L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (confirmed). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent captures the latest regime. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand variability and let the OR backend compute safety stock accordingly. These choices balance service (use recent elevated demand like 54) against holding given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan-Feb) show mean ~41.4 and confirmed actual lead time = 0 in prior concludes. Pipeline is zero so orders must cover current period demand; using default methods gives L=promised(0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on all samples to stabilize against noise (balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost). This yields (1+L)\xd7mean demand forecast and standard deviation across all samples for the OR engine to compute base stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (P1\u2013P7). Recent demand shows an uptick (notably Periods 2 and 7 with 54 and 55), so I bias the forecast to recent weeks. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to adapt to the most recent regime while keeping sigma_hat default to reflect overall demand volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to recent demand spikes while using realized lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline coverage and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) across many periods and no sustained demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over history; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Profit= $1, Holding=$1 so critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) making base_stock = mu_hat; using default methods keeps backend forecast anchored to full-sample mean and variance while respecting confirmed L=0 and avoiding overreaction to recent variability.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0; demand history averages around prior samples. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no evidence of lost shipments, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (use full historical mean) against holding cost with the backend's z* cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows arrivals always same-period (lead time 0). Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show stable mean ~41.4 with no sustained regime shift in the last 11 periods. Given confirmed L=0, no evidence of a demand changepoint or increased volatility, I use default calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with long-run mean demand while letting the backend cap protect against variability and lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows all orders arriving same period (lead time = 0). No sustained demand regime change detected despite volatility in individual weeks. Using promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) lets the OR backend compute base_stock consistent with long-run sample statistics; with profit=holding the implied service quantile is 0.5, so this conservative choice balances service vs. holding without overfitting to recent spikes or single-week outages.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent realized weekly demand has been elevated and variable (recent 5 concluded demands: 22, 40, 54, 69, 58; avg ~48.6). Past carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods. Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand regime and avoid underordering. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility; with profit=holding, z*=0 so base_stock\u2248mu_hat which balances fill-rate vs holding under equal costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (seed) mean=41.4. Recent periods show high variability including a 98-unit spike but only five seed samples provided; confirmed lead time=0 from concluded history. To keep decisions grounded in observed long-run demand and the confirmed same-period replenishment, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (using established mean) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* = 0.5 quantile trade-off will be applied by backend.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. Recent demand has risen sharply vs. earlier samples (Periods 11-15 demands = 54,69,58,98,91; recent mean=74). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment covering next period. Lead time historically observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat to recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the new higher regime (mean\u224874). Set sigma_hat to recent_N (last 5) to capture increased volatility (recent sample std \u224819.7). These choices push the base-stock to reflect current elevated demand while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P16) show every order arrived same period; carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. Recent periods show elevated demand vs. early samples, but lead time remains 0 and no lost shipments observed. Use default L to trust promised lead time (0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs. holding cost given symmetric profit/holding (q=0.5) and lets OR engine set z*=0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has risen and stayed high from Period 12 through Period 17 (demands: 69,58,98,91,101,91) \u2014 a sustained higher-demand regime (6 periods). I keep L at promised (default) since lead time confirmed 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the detected regime (N=6) to capture the higher recent mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to set safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period). Demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 14 (sustained high demand P14\u2013P18). I set L to default (promised lead time=0) since concludes confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 14\u201318, length 5) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and sigma_hat captures recent volatility (last 5). This increases service level to avoid stockouts during the new high-demand regime while recognizing holding cost parity (profit=$1, holding=$1) by using recent regime stats rather than long-run low-demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand increased from ~41 (earlier periods) to 91.2 over Periods 14\u201318 (+122%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (weekly demands mostly ~75\u2013101; last 6 weeks average \u224887.3). On-hand=24, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised and observed lead time have been 0 historically. I set L=default to use promised 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Period 14\u201319). For sigma I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P20). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 14 (prior mean ~41 \u2192 recent high-demand mean ~91.2 over P14\u2013P18). To capture the new regime I use recent_N=7 (Periods 14\u201320) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand and current variability. L uses default (promised) = 0 since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet the higher service-level implied by the sustained demand increase while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety-stock magnitude; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with older low-demand periods. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

No overdue or missing shipments to account for. To capture the higher-post-change demand I use recent_N over the detected regime (Periods 14\u201321, length=8) for demand mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history consistently shows 0.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime (uses last 5 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while using recent volatility to avoid overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201323, 10 samples) to capture the higher mean/volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 so the OR engine builds base-stock appropriate to the new demand level while limiting excess stock given equal profit and holding costs.

Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324 = 80,110,93,112,79) averages ~94.8; I use a recent-N forecast to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping L at the confirmed 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (higher mean ~91 since P14). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; expect (1+L) review window with L=0. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 14\u201325 regime length \u224812) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; this balances service (capturing elevated demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile is 0.5. Using recent data avoids diluting the elevated mean with older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201326). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 14 (recorded previously). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201326, N=13) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent high-demand samples \u2014 this raises base-stock and safety stock to protect service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding oversized allocation from older low-demand data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 14 (weeks 14\u201327) so use recent samples from that regime. On-hand=29, in-transit=0; promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time historically. Set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=14, Periods 14\u201327) so the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the new higher mean and measured volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and a demand regime shift at Period 14 (documented previously). Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 79,77,63,59,57) is lower than peak but stable; I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime: mu_hat set to (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples (~67 units) to match current demand level and avoid excess holding, sigma_hat set from last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility (std ~10.3). L left as default (promised 0), which is supported by multiple confirmed 0-period arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current+lead demand. Historical data show a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 14 (already recorded). Promised lead time has been consistently 0 (arrivals observed same period). I use L=default to keep promised 0. To capture the elevated demand regime and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (Periods 14\u201329, length=16) so forecast reflects the higher mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=16 to capture current variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent-regime stats rather than all-history dilution.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P30) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (avg demand increased markedly). To reflect the higher, sustained post-changepoint demand, I use recent_N demand estimates over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201330, length=17). L uses default (promised lead time=0) consistent with observed arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 to focus the forecast and volatility on the new higher-demand regime, balancing service level (capture higher mean) against holding cost by avoiding reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand regime increased around Period 14 and remains elevated; however I will use default estimators so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance (with L=promised 0). This keeps base_stock = mean demand (z*=0 since profit=holding), providing a balanced service level without overstocking given equal profit/holding cost and no evidence of new regime beyond the previously recorded shift.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead time 0 (Periods 1\u201332 arrivals matched orders). A sustained demand regime shift was recorded at Period 14 (higher mean vs earlier). Recent demand (Periods 24\u201332: 79,77,63,59,57,77,75,64,51) averages ~67\u2014still above pre-shift (~41) but below the early post-shift peak. To capture the recent regime while remaining responsive to continued elevated demand, I set L=default (promised lead time = 0, supported by many confirmed 0 lead-time observations). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable window. For volatility I also use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent variability. These parameters steer the OR backend to target a base stock aligned with recent demand while avoiding excessive inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment since Period 1 and prior carry-over confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (higher mean). I set L via "calculate" to let backend confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded data. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201333 length=20) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This ensures orders cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new demand level while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent through Period 34). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 14; recent periods remain higher and more variable. On-hand=46, in-transit=0; to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while reacting to the higher regime, I use recent_N estimates over the post-changepoint regime. Selected L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. Selected mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 weeks (post-shift) so the OR backend raises base-stock for higher mean and empirical volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

No recent evidence of lead-time changes (past concludes show lead_time=0). To protect availability given the higher demand regime while controlling holding cost, use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates using the most recent 20 weeks to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. This increases base stock to meet (1+L)-period demand under the new regime while letting the backend cap orders to limit extreme replenishment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 33-37 = 95,35,36,49,61) shows a lower, volatile regime versus the earlier high-demand spike; no new sustained regime change detected. Keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current short-term mean for the (1+L) review+lead horizon and avoid overstocking from the earlier spike. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current observed volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to current demand while balancing profit vs. holding cost given low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P38). Demand spiked around Period 14 and stayed elevated; more recently (Periods 34\u201338) demand has softened to a lower regime (weekly demands: 35,36,49,61,61; mean=48.4). To reflect the recent lower demand while respecting confirmed 0 lead time, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)*recent mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=8, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time=0 (sustained across many periods) and a demand regime shift starting Period 14 (higher mean since P14). To capture the post-shift demand pattern I use recent data from the new regime: set L to default (promised=0) and compute demand mean and volatility from the most recent 20 periods of concluded demand (captures most recent behavior while smoothing noise). This helps the OR backend size base-stock to reflect the sustained higher demand and recent variability, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm lead time=0; recent demand shows lower, volatile demand vs mid-year spike. Profit=holding => q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock equals mu_hat; using recent_N (last 5 weeks: Periods 36\u201340 demands = 49,61,61,41,26) to set demand forecast and volatility gives a responsive forecast that captures the recent downshift while still reflecting short-term variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime uplift from Period 14, but recent weekly demand (Periods 37\u201341 = 61,61,41,26,27) has moderated. No shipments overdue. To reflect the recent slowdown while preserving the confirmed LT=0, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks; this reduces excess inventory risk while keeping service for current demand. With profit=holding, the backend will target median demand (z*=0) so using recent demand stats tightens orders to current pace.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P42). Demand history shows a sustained higher regime since Period 14 (previously recorded) but recent single large spike (Period 42 demand=159) appears event-driven (likely Black Friday) and not a sustained new regime. To avoid overreacting to one large outlier and because lead time is reliably 0, use default estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service level (covers the elevated baseline demand since Period 14 via historical mean) against holding cost and avoids excess inventory from the one-off spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). History shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals always same period) and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (Periods 14\u201318). Recent demand has been variable with a one large spike (Period 42=159). To be responsive to current observed demand while avoiding overreacting to a single outlier, I use recent_N=5 for demand forecast (captures last 5 weeks mean \u224860.6). Keep L at default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. Use recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings make mu_hat reflect near-term demand and sigma_hat reflect recent variability, letting the backend compute a base stock appropriate for current demand and balanced vs. holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 14. On-hand=22, in-transit=0; with promised L=0 we must cover current-period demand after ordering. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (history confirms 0). Demand forecast: use recent_N with N=20 to focus the mean on the most recent stable regime (caps N at 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples). Volatility: use recent_N N=20 to capture recent demand variability for safety stock. These choices prioritize service (higher recent mean) while using a recent-window std to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift at Period 14 (higher mean) and recent large spikes (Periods 42 and 45). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times confirm 0, so use default lead time. To capture recent elevated demand and high short-term volatility heading into late December, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 41\u201345) so the OR backend targets inventory to recent demand levels while reflecting recent variability.

No current evidence of lost shipments. To let the OR engine use full historical stats and the promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service-level (uses long-run mean & variance) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.
