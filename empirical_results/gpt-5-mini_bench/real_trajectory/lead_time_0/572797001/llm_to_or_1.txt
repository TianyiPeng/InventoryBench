Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a seasonal womens tank top with five weekly historical demand samples (mean=106.4 units/week). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default=0). Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) via the engine's newsvendor quantile.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent realized demand: Period1 demand=128 (stocked out, sold 115). Historical weekly samples (Jan-Feb) mean=106.4, no sustained (>3 periods) demand shift detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last order (P1) arrived with lead_time=0 as promised. Use promised lead time (default) since observed lead_time=0 but only one observation. Use default demand estimates (no changepoint): mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean of all samples; sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. These settings rely on historical mean but will let OR compute safety stock; they balance service level against holding cost given only a single high-demand realization (not yet sustained).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Actual lead time observed in concluded periods = 0 (orders in P1 and P2 arrived same period). Recent realized demand (128,207) is above historical sample mean (~106) but is only two high periods so not yet a sustained regime change. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to give weight to recent high demand while retaining historical signal. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) since variance change is not yet confirmed. These settings raise target base-stock moderately to reduce stockouts while limiting extra holding cost given holding/profit tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (earlier Jan-Feb) show mean ~103.6, but concluded periods 1-3 demands = [128,207,175] indicating a sustained higher demand regime over 3 periods. All observed arrivals conclude lead_time=0 (Periods 1-3). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (weights (1+L) included by backend). Sigma set to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts given the clear uplift while keeping variance estimation tied to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg demand increased from 103.6 (historical Jan samples) to 170.0 (Periods 1-3 concluded) (+64.1%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent concluded periods show a sustained demand regime increase (Periods 1-3 concluded avg demand \u2248170 over 3 periods vs historical Jan mean \u2248103.6). All observed arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P4 arrived same period). Current on-hand=83, in-transit=0; demand remains elevated so aim base stock using the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 0) since concluded lead-time observations confirm 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = regime length =3). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility of the recent regime. These choices raise target base stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-5): [128,207,175,121,68] show a higher and more volatile demand profile than the historical Jan samples (mean ~106). All concluded orders (P1\u2013P5) arrived same-period => actual lead time confirmed 0. No overdue/lost shipments. To reflect the recent elevated/volatile demand I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect last 5 concluded periods; keep L as default (promised=0) because observed lead time=0. This balances service (higher mean) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute a base-stock using the up-to-date mean and volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6 = 121, 68, 73) show a sustained lower regime versus earlier spike; on-hand=112, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L=default. To reflect the recent downward demand regime and limit holding cost while maintaining service (profit/holding implies high service), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses last 3 concluded demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk given current trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows lead_time observed = 0 in all arrivals; on-hand=40, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical Jan samples are lower but a sustained demand regime shift was detected beginning Period 4 (higher mean). I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Period4-7 concluded) to capture the new higher regime when computing (1+L)*mean. I use sigma recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand increased from 103.6 (historical Jan samples) to 170.0 (Periods 1-3 concluded) (+64.1%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period through Period 8). Demand history (concluded): [128,207,175,121,68,73,72,197]. A previously recorded regime shift (higher mean in early periods) exists but recent demand is mixed with a large spike in Period 8. To balance service vs holding cost I use observed lead time (calculate) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 concluded samples to capture current level and volatility without overreacting to a single spike.

Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P9 arrived same period) so use calculated lead time. Recent demand shows elevated and variable levels vs historical Jan baseline; to adapt to recent regime and capture current variability I use recent_N=3 (last 3 concluded demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the most recent demand pattern while limiting inventory holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in history are consistently 0 (orders concluded same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 73,72,197,117,135) shows a higher, more variable regime than the older Jan samples; to capture current demand level and volatility I use a recent_N window of 5 (most recent 5 concluded periods). This sets mu_hat to (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 demands, supporting the OR backend to target service given higher recent demand while limiting holding cost given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in history concluded with lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime vs Jan baseline (carry-over noted). To react to the higher recent mean while limiting holding cost, I set L using observed lead times, use a recent-window forecast for mu_hat to capture the current regime, and estimate sigma from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This gives the OR engine a demand estimate responsive to the higher recent demand while letting the capped ordering rule limit excessive orders.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period (0) lead times and elevated demand since Periods 1-3 sustained through Period 12. On-hand=81, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers little upcoming demand. I use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history; this balances service level (captures the sustained higher mean) against holding cost without overfitting recent noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 consistently (orders in Periods 1-13 concluded with lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated; using the last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 9-13: 117,135,202,111,40) captures current regime and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead window. These parameters balance service (cover recent mean demand ~121 units) vs. holding cost given healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand is variable: last 5 concluded demands = [135, 202, 111, 40, 49] (mean ~107). On-hand=121, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in observed concludes, so keep L=default. To capture recent regime and volatility while giving the OR engine up-to-date demand, use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over last 5). This biases orders toward the recent realized demand pattern, supporting high service (profit/holding implies q\u22480.8) while avoiding excess hold given the recent drop in some weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in prior periods arrived same period). Recent demand is volatile with a sustained higher regime identified earlier; no new sustained changepoint since carry-over insight. I use L=default (promised 0) given consistent concluded lead_time=0. For demand I focus on the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest demand mix (Periods 11-15 demands: 202,111,40,49,189) so the base-stock targets the current realized demand and balances profit vs holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand is elevated and volatile versus historical Jan samples (recent demands trending higher), so use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime for both demand mean and volatility. This raises target base-stock to favor service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while keeping variability estimation recent to avoid over/under stocking.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many periods with 'arrived' = ordered, lead_time=0). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 (higher mean sustained), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the post-shift demand pattern. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (regime length from Period 4 through Period 17 = 14 periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent regime; this balances higher service level needed after the sustained demand increase against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime starting at Period 4 (avg \u2248170 over Periods 1-3 concluded vs historical Jan mean \u2248103.6). On-hand=83, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0, so use default L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime length (N=15 periods since the changepoint) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reflecting the elevated mean and updated volatility. This increases base-stock to reduce stockouts under the new regime while sigma_hat based on recent data keeps safety stock proportional to observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). A demand regime shift was previously identified (avg ~170 vs historical ~104) and recent weekly demands remain volatile but centered higher than the original Jan samples. To respect the observed same-day arrivals use default lead time. To capture the elevated recent demand and variability, use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 5 weeks, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many concluded lines: 'lead_time was 0 periods'), so use promised/default lead time. A sustained demand regime shift was previously recorded (higher recent means including the large spike in Period 20), but no new additional sustained changepoint since last insight. To let the OR engine combine all data and its cap logic, use default demand and volatility settings so base-stock is computed from full sample set with L=promised (0). This balances service (captures higher recent sales through historical samples) versus holding cost without over-committing to an explicitly higher forecast.

Historical Jan mean ~106.4 but a sustained higher-demand regime was detected from Period 4 onward (~170 avg) and persists through recent periods (Periods 4\u201321). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while emphasizing recent realized demand, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent 18 periods (the regime since Period 4), which balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=19 periods since Period 4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand and recent variability; this aligns the OR base-stock toward a high service target (q=0.8) while letting the cap limit extreme orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Current on-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (orders in history all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent carry-over noted a sustained demand regime increase earlier in the run, but no new sustained changepoint since Period 24. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the optimizer balance the profit/holding cost tradeoff given stable observed lead time and the full historical demand distribution.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent weeks (Periods 21-25) show moderately elevated and volatile summer demand (124,81,167,169,77) versus historical Jan samples. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. To keep service high while containing holding cost, I use promised/default lead time, but base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the summer regime. Thus: L=default; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect current mean demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrive same period), so keep L as promised (default). Demand regime shift noted earlier (sustained higher mean from Period 1-3 vs Jan samples) but recent realized demands (Periods 22-26: 81,167,169,77,60) show a new short-run pattern; to adapt the forecast to the most recent demand behaviour I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 5 concluded demand observations) so the OR backend targets inventory appropriate for current variance and mean while default L preserves demonstrated same-period arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently. A demand regime shift was previously confirmed at Period 4 (sustained higher mean). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility, taking the most recent regime length (Period 4\u2192Period 27 \u2248 24 weeks) capped at 20 \u2192 N=20 so forecasts weight recent higher-demand behavior. This keeps base_stock responsive to the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; together they balance service (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1). No overdue shipments detected.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=166, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods; recent demand (Periods 25-28: 77,60,39,49) is trending lower than earlier spikes. To reflect the recent lower demand regime while keeping the proven lead-time, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 concluded demand samples (N=4) to adapt forecast mean and volatility to the recent downshift and reduce overstock risk given holding cost >0. These parameters balance service level and holding cost by lowering the base-stock toward recent demand while preserving same-period replenishment behavior.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; recent demand has moderated compared to earlier spikes. Last 5 concluded weekly demands = [77,60,39,49,114], mean \u224867.8. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (observed arrivals always same-period); use default for L to let backend assume promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime and avoid overweighting older high-variance spikes. This balances service (covers ~1+L period demand) while limiting holding cost given current moderate recent demand and low pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 -> use default promised L=0. Recent demand (Periods 26-30: 60,39,49,114,110) is lower than the early-summer spikes; I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the current lower regime and avoid overstock given holding cost > 0. Use N=5 to smooth short-term noise while remaining responsive. Sigma set with recent_N N=5 to match volatility of the same recent window. These choices keep base-stock responsive to current demand and minimize holding cost while preserving service ability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for this period's demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in many periods (consistent), so keep L as default (promised). Recent demand (most recent weeks) is higher than the Jan baseline; to capture current demand level I use a recent_N forecast over the last 8 samples to adapt to the post-change regime while keeping volatility estimated from full history. This raises the base_stock to protect service while sigma uses full-sample std to avoid underestimating variability.

Recent demand shows a lower average than the early-season spike; I use a short recent window to capture current regime. Set L=default to trust promised 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the last 5 demand samples (Periods 28-32) so the OR backend will target service vs holding based on current demand volatility.

Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (many periods), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (last several weeks) is lower than the earlier spring spike; to capture current seasonality I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent 8 samples to balance responsiveness and noise. This helps the OR engine set a base-stock that reflects current lower weekly demand while retaining some safety for variability; default lead time avoids introducing unnecessary pipeline given observed 0-period arrivals. No evidence of missing shipments currently.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent concluded weekly demand has moderated versus mid-year peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [110,123,75,67,48], average ~84.6. On-hand=59, in-transit=0. All observed concluded lead times = 0 (consistent). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 samples to reflect the recent downshift and avoid overstocking from earlier high-season peaks. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to capture current reduced variability. These settings keep target base-stock aligned to recent demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand, use promised lead time (default) and default demand statistics (all samples) so base-stock reflects overall historical mean/variance while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise given zero on-hand/in-transit.

Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=29, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed (historical concluded lead times = 0). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P32-P36 demands = 75,67,48,118,152; mean=92) is lower than the early-period elevated regime noted previously, so I downweight long-run historical mean and use a recent-window forecast to better match current demand. L set to promised (default) since all concluded orders show lead_time=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to target (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility, which reduces overstock risk while keeping service given current sales. No lost shipments to account for.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I use L=default (promised lead time=0). Demand shows a previously recorded sustained uplift (already in carry-over), but no new changepoint in recent concluded demands; therefore use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock grounded in full-sample statistics while the confirmed 0 lead time ensures orders, if placed, arrive same period per promise.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time. Demand has shown a sustained regime shift earlier in the year; recent demand pattern (last several months) is more relevant than Jan baseline, so use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to reflect current regime and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost. Chose N=20 to capture recent seasonality and variability without overfitting short blips.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Observed concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0), and demand has been at an elevated, sustained level since earlier periods. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on recent data to capture the sustained higher regime. Therefore set L=default; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent demand regime and reduce sensitivity to older low-Jan samples. This gives the OR engine a demand forecast aligned with current higher demand and a volatility estimate reflecting recent variability, balancing profit-driven service level and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior recorded shift; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run demand while leveraging observed reliable 0-period lead time; with profit/holding favoring high service (q\u22480.8), defaults let OR engine set safety stock appropriately.

Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 112, 93, 109, 145, 95) reflects current regime; use recent_N (N=5) to capture near-term mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead window.

Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand after decision. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods \u2192 use default L. Recent demand shows elevated and volatile demand in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 40-42: 145, 95, 328) suggesting a short recent regime with higher mean and volatility; choose recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory to cover this recent demand level and higher variance, balancing service (profit $4) vs holding ($1). No new multi-period sustained pattern beyond previously recorded regime shift to add to carry-over.

Recent demand shows elevated variability (including a 328 spike in Period 42); to capture current regime I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets an order-up-to that reflects recent higher demand while avoiding excessive safety stock from older low-demand weeks.

Recent demand shows holiday volatility but no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded insight; we keep default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs. early-year Jan baseline (recent 5 concluded demands avg \u2248 147 vs. historical Jan avg \u2248 103.6) and holiday season shows higher volatility. On-hand=65, in-transit=0 so we must size orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time -> use default L to keep backend assumption. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability (10-week window balances responsiveness and noise). This raises base-stock to protect service during holiday demand while the OR engine will cap orders per its cap rule, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, and recent demands show variability but no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shifts. I keep L at promised (default) because concluded history supports lead_time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service vs holding cost given no new significant changepoint. This also avoids overreacting to short December volatility while on-hand stock (90) provides some cover this period.
