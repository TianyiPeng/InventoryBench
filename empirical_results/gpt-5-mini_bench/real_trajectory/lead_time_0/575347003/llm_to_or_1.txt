Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~33.8 units/week; no sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time (default=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps parameters conservative given no evidence of lead-time slips or demand shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 and stockout occurred (demand 39, sold 34). Historical weekly samples (29,28,41,40,31) give mean ~33.8 and std ~6.2. I use default lead time (promised L=0 confirmed by recent arrival), and default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of all samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample statistics while accounting for current zero on-hand/pipeline to prompt ordering to cover expected weekly demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent realized demands (Period1=39, Period2=51) exceed older weekly samples but evidence of a sustained shift is weak (only 2 high periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and concluded arrivals show orders in P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=0; no overdue shipments. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect actual 0-period arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to tilt the forecast toward the most recent samples while respecting minimum sample window (captures recent higher demand but avoids overfitting two volatile weeks). Sigma_hat uses default to leverage full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (capture recent demand uptick) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan-Feb) mean=33.8; recent realized demand in Periods 1-3 = [39,51,62], mean=50.67, showing a sustained higher-demand regime. Observed lead times from concluded periods are all 0, so use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent regime shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand observations (N=3) so the OR backend bases base-stock on the higher recent mean and volatility; L set to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. This balances service (avoid stockouts given clear recent demand rise) against holding cost by relying on short lead time and using recent-demand volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from 33.80 to 50.67 (+50%)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods1-4) show a sustained upward regime vs historical mean (33.8 \u2192 ~51). Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 1\u20134). This raises the base-stock forecast to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand elevated: last 3 concluded demands = 62, 53, 44 (avg=53), supporting the previously detected regime shift. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived same period). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand after decision. I set L=default to trust observed 0 LT; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect the sustained higher mean (gives (1+L)\xd7mean \u224853); sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward current higher demand while keeping holding cost in check given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (Periods 1-6), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows a sustained higher regime (demands: 39,51,62,53,44,57), avg \u2248 51 over last 6 periods versus earlier baseline; use recent 6-period demand to capture current regime for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Volatility also estimated from the same recent window. These choices ensure the OR backend centers base-stock on the current higher demand regime while keeping variability aligned with recent observations to balance service level and holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0; last concluded periods show consistently higher demand vs earlier Jan samples (Periods 1-7 demands: 39,51,62,53,44,57,66). A demand regime shift to higher weekly demand was previously noted. I keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 3-7) so the OR engine sets a larger base stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost with the profit=holding cost parity.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has stepped up (last 3 realized demands: 57, 66, 95) versus earlier lower levels; use a short recent window to capture the higher regime. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded orders show lead_time=0, so keep L as default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new higher mean and increased volatility, improving service while avoiding excess holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

To match the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (default), set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the recent demand mean across the review+lead period, and set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This increases order targets to meet current demand spikes while keeping holding cost consideration via the OR cap.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand has been much higher than the Jan-Feb baseline (recent demands: P6-10 = 57,66,95,73,81; mean=74.4) \u2014 previous carry-over noted a regime shift at Periods 1-3; recent data confirms a sustained elevated demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples \u224874.4). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts under the sustained higher demand while keeping variability estimates tied to recent observations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 across all concluded periods, so use observed average lead time. Recent demand has increased materially in the last 4\u20135 periods; to capture current regime use recent_N for demand and volatility (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand (periods 7-11: 66,95,73,81,145). These parameters help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while capping orders via its cap rule to limit excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg demand increased from 53.14 (P1\u2013P7) to 98.50 (P8\u2013P11), +85.4% (sustained 4 periods)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201312 arrived same period). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 8: recent demands P8\u2013P12 = [95,73,81,145,130], avg=104.8 (sustained 5 periods). To target the new higher demand while avoiding excess holding, set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new regime (use last 5 samples P8\u2013P12). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast anchored to the confirmed higher-demand regime and lets the backend compute the appropriate base-stock and cap given q=0.5.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use calculate to let backend confirm. Demand clearly shifted up starting Period 8 (sustained); use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 8\u201313) so mu_hat reflects the higher regime ((95,73,81,145,130,88) mean \u2248102 over 1-period review \u2192 (1+L) scaling handled by backend). Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These parameters prioritize service in the higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in P1\u2013P14 all arrived same period). Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 8 (weeks 8\u201314 show elevated demand); to capture the current higher demand I use a recent-window forecast. Set L=default to reflect observed zero lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length P8\u2013P14 = 7) so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 so I use default promised L=0. Demand has shifted up since Period 8 (sustained higher regime); to capture the current elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N based estimates over the recent regime (Periods 8\u201315, 8 samples). This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher demand while limiting obsolete inventory given profit=holding (equal costs) which favors service-level parity.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across all concluded orders), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Demand has stepped up starting around Period 8 and remains elevated through Period 16; I treat the recent high-demand regime (Periods 8\u201316) as the relevant forecast window. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (regime length P8\u2013P16 = 9 samples) to capture the elevated mean and volatility while meeting the OR engine requirement to cover review+lead demand. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given zero lead time and sustained higher demand, while sigma based on the same recent window ensures safety stock reflects current variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

No strong recent regime reversal beyond already recorded carry-over insights, so use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)). Defaults keep the OR engine anchored to full history while respecting observed same-period arrivals; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised LT=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 (consistent historical evidence P1\u2013P18). Demand exhibits a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 8 (carry-over notes). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (periods 8\u201318) because the most recent regime from P8 onward is sustained (~11 periods) and better represents current higher demand; same N used for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to reduce stockouts given elevated demand while letting the capped order limit temper excess holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P19 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand has been elevated and more variable since the regime shift recorded earlier (P8+). To keep the base-stock responsive to the recent higher-demand regime, I focus forecasts on the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 13\u201319) which capture current demand levels. Therefore I use L=default (promised=0), mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to set (1+L)*mean of recent samples, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (by reflecting higher recent demand) against holding cost by not over-weighting older, lower-demand weeks.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 8 (much larger weekly demand). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample set while the backend's capped ordering will limit order size versus volatility and holding cost tradeoff.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 (sustained elevated demand through Period 22); therefore I use recent_N over the most recent 15 post-changepoint samples to capture the higher mean and volatility, which raises base_stock to reduce stockouts while the capped order cap limits excess holding cost.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). All observed arrivals have lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201323 conclude show arrived same period), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. Demand has trended up with confirmed regime shifts earlier (P1\u2013P3 and P8/P12), so I bias forecasts to recent history. I set L=default to reflect consistently observed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (covering the most recent 12 weeks, capturing the current higher-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend builds base_stock from the recent mean and volatility and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period (no delays). Demand has shifted upward and has been sustained since Period 8 (carry-over insight). To make the forecast reflect the sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 8\u201324) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-scaled mean and std reflect the current regime. L uses default (promised) = 0 to match observed reliable same-period arrivals. This increases service level for elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in P1\u2013P25 arrived same period). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so pipeline short for upcoming demand \u2014 recent weeks show higher demand regime vs early samples. I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (last 8 weeks) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent variability; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This biases the base-stock upward to cover near-term elevated demand while avoiding excess hold given $1 holding cost equals profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand is elevated and volatile; using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat captures the latest demand level (last five demands ~123,126,117,79,106 \u2192 mean \u2248110) so the backend sets base_stock to current high-demand regime. Use default sigma_hat to let the backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has settled above early-period levels after the previously recorded regime shifts (sustained higher demand since P8 and P12). On-hand=30, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; with promised lead time historically confirming 0-period arrivals (all concluded orders show lead_time=0), I keep L as default (promised=0). To match the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 observed demands: P23\u2013P27 = 126,117,79,106,81) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from those most recent samples. This biases orders toward current demand while limiting overreaction to single-week noise and balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding= $1.

Recent demand has settled lower than peak summer weeks\u2014use a short recent window to capture current regime. Set L=default to respect promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 24\u201328), keeping ordering responsive to the recent downshift and avoiding excess holding cost.

Recent demand exhibits variability but no new sustained regime shift since previously recorded insights (Period 12). On-hand=31, in-transit=0; using default lead time (promised=0) and default demand statistics lets the OR backend use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded lead_times = 0). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use a short recent window to forecast (captures downward trend).

Date 2019-09-30. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 29\u201333 = 59,52,42,51,74) implies the short-run mean is ~55.6, lower than the earlier peak regime; use recent_N=5 to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to this cooler recent demand while trusting promised lead time.

Demand history shows weeks of high variability but no new sustained regime shift since prior insights; use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full sample mean/variance. This keeps orders aligned with observed average demand while avoiding unjustified escalation of forecasts given no new 3+ period evidence. Default L ensures pipeline matches promised lead time; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute base-stock and cap balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use default promised lead time. Recent demand shows no new sustained regime beyond earlier documented shifts; last 5 concluded demands = [74,43,65,33,55], mean=54. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current demand level (1+L scaled). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep replenishment responsive to the current demand pattern while using confirmed lead-time=0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show earlier sustained demand regime shifts captured in carry-over; recent weeks (P35\u2013P38) show moderate variability but no new 3+ period sustained shift. Promised lead time remains appropriate. Use default L to keep promised lead time, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this leverages all historical demand including established regime changes and avoids overreacting to short recent fluctuations. This balances service (profit=holding) by relying on the backend's base-stock calculation and capped ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks; last 5 concluded demands are: P35=65, P36=33, P37=55, P38=47, P39=35 \u2014 this recent window captures the apparent downward regime and short-term volatility. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets (1+L)-period demand and variance based on the latest regime, limiting overstock while maintaining service. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift in concluded history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods; recent demand shows higher mean and volatility vs early samples but no new sustained changepoint since prior insights. Given confirmed lead_time=0 and substantial historical sample set, use default calculations so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use full history to reflect long-run demand) vs holding cost when profit=holding (neutral).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent sales have moderated from earlier high regime; last 6\u20138 periods show demand ~33\u201346/week. On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so we should target (1+L)-period forecast based on recent lower regime to avoid excess holding. All observed concluded lead times = 0, so use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N for demand and volatility to reflect the most recent behavior (N=8 captures the latest trough without overfitting). This balances service (cover next period demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 across all past periods (orders concluded with lead_time 0). Demand has occasional spikes (P42=101) but no new sustained regime (need \u22653 periods); existing carry-over insights already record earlier regime shifts. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine aligned with historical lead time certainty while avoiding overreaction to a single high-demand week, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Demand has been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insights.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (no missing shipments); demand has shown past regime shifts (recorded previously) but no new sustained change in the last periods. I use default lead time so backend uses the promised L=0, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs. holding cost using the full historical sample set.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows elevated mean vs early-year baseline and a spike (Period 42=101) but last five periods (P41\u2013P45) average ~59.4 units. No concluded evidence of lead-time change; promised lead time=0 remains appropriate. To balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost I target the recent demand regime: set L=default (0) so forecasting horizon=(1+L)=1 period, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest regime (~59.4), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost and current on-hand=13.

Recent demand history displays variability but no new sustained regime shift since previously recorded insights. To maintain service while avoiding extra holding cost (profit = holding cost \u2192 q=0.5, z*=0), use promised lead time and population statistics so base_stock anchors to overall mean demand. Methods chosen: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the OR backend on historical average replenishment given no evidence of lost shipments or new sustained demand change.
