Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples show recent nonzero demand (0,0,9,23,26) with mean=11.6 and std\u224812.38. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and no arrivals observed yet. No sustained changepoint detected; use default lead time and aggregate demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with overall historical mean and variability while accounting for high profit vs holding (service level ~0.95).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: sample demands (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) = [0,0,9,23,26]; Period 1 order arrived with observed lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we need replenishment. No sustained (>3 periods) regime change detected despite a two-week uptick, so use default statistics: keep promised lead time (default) and use all-sample mean/std to let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap. This balances high profit (profit/holding \u2192 high service quantile) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to a short 2-week spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1007.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand shows a clear uptick in late Jan/early Feb (samples: 9,23,26). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; previous two orders (Periods 1-2) both concluded with lead_time=0, so actual lead time appears to be 0. I set L via calculate (average observed lead times=0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of those 3 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of those 3 samples. This biases the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the upward demand shift while keeping holding cost in check since holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg demand for 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 = 19.33 (samples 9,23,26) vs prior two-week avg = 0.0

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent concluded history shows consistent 0 promised lead_time realized (orders in P1-P3 arrived with lead_time=0). On-hand=55, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent weeks: 9,23,26). To respect that confirmed higher-demand regime and limit stockouts while controlling holding costs, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the three most recent higher-demand samples, which captures the new regime (mean \u224819.33) and tighter recent volatility for the OR engine to compute a higher base-stock but avoid excessive inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $479.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows orders consistently arriving with lead_time=0 and recent elevated demand vs pre-2019-01-21. I keep L at default (promised=0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while weighting latest weeks more, I use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat. To reflect increased recent volatility I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 (captures recent demand variability). These choices raise target base stock to preserve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while using sigma from recent samples to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21 (samples: 9,23,26) vs prior zeros; on-hand=28, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times in Periods 1-5 are 0 periods (orders arrived same period). I keep L at promised (default) because empirical lead times confirm 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (high profit-to-holding ratio implies high target fill) with holding cost while leveraging the detected demand regime shift in the history the backend will use.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized weekly demand is elevated and volatile (period demands: 54, 90, 55, 29, 54, 64) compared with pre-2019 samples; on-hand=18, in-transit=0 and no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use observed lead-time estimate. Set L using observed average (calculate). For demand, use recent_N over the last 6 concluded periods to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=6). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current weekly demand while keeping holding cost in check by relying on short lead time and recent demand statistics.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed in Periods 1-6 conclude: orders placed P1..P6 arrived with lead_time=0).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 3\u20137) = [55,29,54,64,26], recent mean \u224845.6. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclues. I set L=default to honor promised lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures current higher demand and variability) so the OR backend raises target base-stock while limiting excess holding given holding cost and confirmed zero lead time. No overdue/lost shipments to account for.

Demand shows sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples 9,23,26); use recent_N=3 to capture the higher recent mean (\u224819.33) for (1+L) period forecast and recent volatility for safety. This balances service (capture higher post-changepoint mean) against holding cost given zero pipeline.

Set L by calculating observed lead times (will yield 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted markedly: Periods 8-10 demands = 92, 102, 138 (avg 110.67), well above the earlier post-Jan shift mean ~19.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I use L=default to keep promised (0) which matches observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 8-10). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the latest regime. These choices bias orders to meet the higher recent demand while the sigma estimate helps the OR backend size safety stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 8: avg demand for Periods 8-10 = 110.67 (samples 92,102,138) vs prior post-Jan avg 19.33 (samples 9,23,26).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-29: recent demand elevated since Period 8 (2019-04-01). Last 4 concluded demands (P8-P11) = 92,102,138,112 \u2192 regime starting P8 with higher mean (~110). On-hand=39, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical observed lead times all 0. To target service during this new high-demand regime, set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0), and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent regime (recent_N with N=4) so the OR backend builds base-stock for the higher mean while capturing recent variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been high and sustained since Period 8 (demands: 92,102,138,112,127). On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes confirm 0 lead time. I set L=default to use promised 0. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 8-12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to meet the elevated demand while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show sustained high demand starting Period 8 (recent demands: P8..P13 = 92,102,138,112,127,96; recent average \u2248111.7). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the post-changepoint regime I use recent_N=6 for demand (covers P8\u2013P13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility; L set to calculate to reflect observed zero lead time. This raises target base-stock to meet high weekly demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent observed lead time has been consistently 0 (orders P1..P14 all arrived same period). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 8 (recent demands: P9..P14 = 102,138,112,127,96,82; recent average \u2248 109). To capture the sustained higher demand, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility based on the last 6 periods. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). This raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent samples helps the OR engine size safety stock appropriately versus holding cost (profit/holding gives a high service target).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (orders P1..P15 arrived same period). Demand stabilized in the higher regime from Period 8 onward; recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 112,127,96,82,85) best represents current demand. Set L to calculate to capture observed lead-time average (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 5 post-shift samples, balancing service vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 and recent sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8 with another shift confirmed at Period 11 (avg ~110). I use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates from the most recent regime: use recent_N over the last 6 weeks (Periods 11-16) to capture current mean/volatility (~99.7 mean). This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent realized demand rather than older zero-demand weeks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime (Periods 8-17) is elevated (~104 units/week vs earlier ~19). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 so coverage is low relative to recent demand; historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently. I set L via observed lead times to confirm zero, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 demand samples (Periods 8-17) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping variability driven by the same window. This balances service (capture the new higher mean) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to recent realized demand rather than older low-demand history. No new carry-over insights to add.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2565.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 8 (week of 2019-04-01) with weekly demand generally in the 90\u2013160 range (Periods 8\u201318). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. Lead time historically observed = 0 in concluded periods. I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent consistent high-demand regime (Periods 8\u201318, 11 weeks) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using recent behavior and captures current mean and volatility; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to reflect current variability. This preserves service during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess holdings given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 for orders (no missing shipments). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 8 (post-Jan spike) with higher weekly demand (~92\u2013160). To capture the post-shift demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N=12 (Periods 8\u201319) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding. L kept at default (promised 0) because observed lead time has been consistently 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 8 (avg \u2248110.7), and concluded lead times have consistently been 0. On-hand=39, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover current + upcoming periods. Set L by calculating observed lead times (recent concludes all show 0). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N over the post-Period-8 regime (N=13 periods) to capture the new higher mean/variance rather than diluting with the earlier near-zero demand data. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock using the recent higher mean and observed variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 (average ~110/wk); on-hand=64, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low vs weekly demand. Historical concludes show consistent 0-period lead time. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (will be 0). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (Periods 8\u201321) so the OR base-stock reflects current demand level and volatility, avoiding understock from older low-demand samples while keeping holding cost in check.

Recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 18-22: 160,111,109,82,59). To capture the recent regime and short-term volatility I set L=default (use promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 weeks' demand (captures the latest demand level and variability) which balances service (higher mean) vs holding cost by reflecting recent decline after a peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 11 (higher weekly demand ~110). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0). For demand I use recent_N covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11-24, length=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/volatility and keep service while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the higher regime established since Period 11 (samples P11..P25). On-hand=58, in-transit=0; shipments have consistently arrived with 0 lead time historically. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=15 (using the last 15 periods from the confirmed high-demand regime P11\u2013P25) so the base-stock reflects the sustained higher demand. I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=15 to capture recent demand volatility. No missing shipments detected; these parameters prioritize service (capture higher recent mean) while sigma informs safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Apr (noted Period 11) with weekly demand mostly around 80\u2013160. On-hand=51, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and historical actual lead time = 0. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime and its mean over the last 10 weeks; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's q calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; recent demand has been the higher post-Jan regime. To match recent demand while avoiding excess holding, I use an L estimate from observed lead times and set demand parameters from the most recent regime (20 most recent samples) so the base-stock reflects current higher mean and observed variability, improving service while containing holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has moderated but remains elevated vs early 2019; last 5 demands (Periods 24-28) = [152,93,98,51,63], mean\u224891.4. On-hand=85, in-transit=0 so available stock ~1 recent-period demand. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-June demand regime while weighting recent variability. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base stock responsive to the recent higher demand (high service level justified by profit/holding ratio) while using recent variance to avoid excessive overstocking.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand (last ~10 weeks) has moderated vs earlier spikes; to reflect current regime and avoid overstock I use a recent_N forecast (N=10) for both mean and volatility so the base-stock target adapts to recent lower demand while the OR engine handles service-level math. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by tightening forecasts to recent demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-09-09 (P31). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has moderated versus the earlier peak: last 5 demands (P26..P30) = [98,51,63,68,40], mean \u2248 64.0. Lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To keep orders aligned with the current lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (captures most recent 5 weeks). This reduces overstocks while preserving service given zero lead time and near-term demand visibility. Parameters chosen to bias base-stock toward recent demand and lower sigma to avoid excessive cap-driven ordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier peaks; last 10 demand samples (Periods 22-31) show a lower/variable regime compared with the earlier high-demand run. To keep service high (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies q\u22480.95) while avoiding excess inventory, I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=10) to capture the current lower regime and a matching recent-N volatility estimate. Lead time remains default (promised 0) given consistent concluded evidence. This balances high service-level target with reduced mu_hat to limit holding cost given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all arrived with lead_time=0). Recent demand has moderated versus prior spikes. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirm 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 23-32 demands = 101,152,93,98,51,63,68,40,32,28; mean=72.6) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same 10 samples. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the latest regime while avoiding over-ordering given current on-hand (107 units covers ~1.48\xd7 the 10-period mean), reducing holding cost risk.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 32,28,46,22,23; avg=30.2) shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 31 (5 periods). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0), forecast demand using recent regime (recent_N N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples, and capture recent volatility with sigma_hat recent_N N=5. This reduces base-stock size to match the lower demand and limits holding cost given current high on-hand and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Periods 31-35 avg demand = 30.2 (samples 32,28,46,22,23) vs prior high-regime avg 110.67 (Periods 8-10); sustained for 5 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 31 (Periods 31-35 demands: 32,28,46,22,23 \u2192 avg 30.2) vs earlier high-regime. On-hand=96, in-transit=0; avoid excess inventory. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 31-35). This reduces risk of overstock while keeping service given short lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime detected at Period 31 (Periods 31-35 avg = 30.2); latest five demands (Periods 33-37 = 46,22,23,21,34) average 29.2. Lead time has been reliably observed as 0 in concluded history through Period 37. On-hand=62 and in-transit=0 provide buffer vs one-period demand; to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default) and recent_N demand estimates based on the most recent 5 samples to capture the current lower-regime mean and volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 31: last 8 demands = [32,28,46,22,23,21,34,18], avg \u224828. Use promised lead time (default, 0) since concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. On-hand=44, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline adequate for ~1\u20132 weeks at current pace but we should target the recent-regime demand. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect the post-Period-31 regime (1+L multiplier applied by backend). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture volatility in these 8 samples. This balances service (matching lower steady demand) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent sustained regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 31 (demands P35-39 = 23,21,34,18,19; avg=23.0). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest low-demand regime ((1+L)*mean based on last 5 periods). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. This keeps base-stock modest to avoid holding cost while covering immediate demand and preserving service with the observed low variance and confirmed lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history through Period 40. Recent demand (Periods 31-40) shows a lower post-peak regime: last 10 demands = [32,28,46,22,23,21,34,18,19,10], mean \u224825.3, supporting use of a recent-N forecast. I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time is stable at 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current lower regime (regime length = 10), and sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to recent demand while avoiding excessive inventory given low holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled back to the low regime observed since Period 36 (demands P36-P41 = 21,34,18,19,10,14; mean \u2248 19.3). On-hand=28, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To align the backend forecast with the current low-demand regime, I use recent_N=6 (the six most recent periods) for both demand mean and volatility so the base-stock targets respond to the current lower demand and avoid excess holding cost. L kept at default (promised 0) since concluded lead-times remain 0. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled to low-to-moderate weekly levels after earlier high spikes. No overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times = 0 so use promised lead time. I choose L=default to keep lead time = promised (0). For demand I detect no strong new regime beyond recent 5 weeks (Periods 38-42: demands 18,19,10,14,25; avg\u224817.2), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect current lower-volatility regime and avoid carrying excessive inventory. This biases orders to cover ~1 week of expected demand while keeping holding cost low.

I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 34\u201343 average \u224819.6) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 10,14,25,10,7) shows a lower regime vs earlier months \u2014 use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect current low-demand regime. Choose N=5 (last 5 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand consistent with the recent low mean while capturing short-run volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given limited on-hand) and holding cost (avoid overstocking before year-end).

Historical lead time has consistently concluded as 0. To keep service for this low-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, I use promised lead time (default) and base the demand forecast on the most recent 6 periods to capture the current low regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the current low-variance demand pattern given profit=$19 and holding=$1 (high implied fill-rate preference).
