Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable weekly demand (~29,32,42,38,37) with no sustained shift. Promised lead time default is used. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 160442043 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and experienced a stockout in Period 1 (demand 44, sold 36). Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~35.6 and moderate variability. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0). No sustained upward demand shift (need \u22653 periods), so use conservative defaults: infer lead time from observed data via average, and let mu_hat/sigma_hat default to (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders in P1 and P2 both had lead_time=0 (arrived same period). Recent demand in P1=44 and P2=114 is elevated vs. historical weekly mean (~35.6) but is only 2 periods\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift. To avoid overfitting to a short spike and because promised lead_time=0 has been confirmed twice, use default methods so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and historical volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods1-3: 44,114,75) is markedly above historical sample mean (29,32,42,38,37 -> mean=35.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for (1+L) periods. Observed conclude messages show all arrivals had lead_time=0; I set L by calculating average observed lead times. For demand I detect a changepoint to a higher regime over the last 3 periods (regime length=3) so I use recent_N,N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the OR backend to size base stock to the new higher mean and volatility, improving service while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: historical mean=35.6 -> recent mean=77.7 (+118%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-11. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1-4). Demand has elevated recently (most recent 4 demands: 44,114,75,50; mean\u224870.75) vs older historical mean\u224835.6. To capture the confirmed higher recent demand while using observed lead time, set L by calculate (avg observed lead times=0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to base (1+L)-period demand on the latest regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping safety buffer aligned to recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-18: recent demand elevated vs historical (historical mean ~35.6 from Jan samples; recent concluded weekly demand: 44,114,75,50,50). On-hand=21, in-transit=0 so limited cover for upcoming week. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (orders arrived same period), so use default L. To capture the recent higher demand pattern, set mu_hat using the 5 most recent samples (recent_N, N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given modest on-hand stock and unit holding cost equal to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has shifted up and remained elevated across the last 6 concluded periods (demands: 44,114,75,50,50,65) vs historical Jan samples. On-hand=2, in-transit=0 \u2014 very low cover vs elevated demand. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine will target a higher base-stock and wider safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 in all observed arrivals. Recent demand has increased and the last 3 concluded demands are 50, 65, 78 (mean \u224864.3), so I use a recent_N=3 demand estimate to capture the new higher regime and short memory; sigma also from recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. Using default L (promised lead time=0) keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed and the recent_N choices raise the base stock to preserve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-04-08. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-8 orders arrived same period), so set L by calculating observed average. Recent demand (Periods 6-8 = 65,78,77) is elevated vs earlier history; I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher current regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand weeks. No shipments are overdue (on-hand=0, in-transit=0), so explicit correction for lost shipments not required now.

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 in all observed periods. Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (multiple periods at ~50-78 units). To reflect the sustained higher regime, keep L at promised (default) and use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 demand observations.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand sustained at a higher regime (~77.5 units/week over last 4 concluded periods P7-P10) vs historical mean 35.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Lead time observed consistently 0 in concludes \u2192 use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 weeks to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR engine raises target base-stock to meet service while avoiding excessive holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical pre-game samples show mean=35.6; recent game history (Periods 1-11) exhibits a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 1-3 note recorded shift). Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. To avoid overfitting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine upweight the sustained higher demand via its internal calculations, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This choice balances service level (captures elevated recent demand through backend's full-sample mean) against holding costs given current modest on-hand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent on-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean=35.6 but a sustained demand regime shift was observed (noted in carry-over) with recent weeks showing much higher demand. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 8-12) = [77,77,78,65,58], mean=71.0 and std ~8.7. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I therefore keep L at default (promised=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting lookback noise. This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand now while sigma based on recent volatility balances service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show every order arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent through Period 13), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demands have been volatile but no new 3+ period sustained shift beyond the previously recorded regime change, so use default demand/volatility calculations (all samples) to let the OR engine compute base_stock while keeping ordering responsive to observed zero lead time. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (orders in Periods 1-14 arrived same period) so use promised lead time (default L=0). Recent demand has shifted upward and stabilized since Periods 1-3 change noted earlier; to capture the recent higher regime I set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent data to boost replenishment sizing and avoid stockouts while sigma_hat stays default to reflect overall observed volatility. This balances service (higher base stock using recent mean) against holding costs by keeping lead time at 0 and using overall volatility for the safety-stock term.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use promised lead time (default). Demand has been elevated vs. the original 5-sample history; to capture recent demand patterns I use a recent_N mean over the last 10 samples to form mu_hat. sigma_hat uses default to scale overall sample volatility by \u221a(1+L). These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate conservative.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean was ~35.6 but demand has shifted higher and remained elevated across many recent periods (sustained weeks with demand mostly 50\u2013127). All concluded orders show lead_time=0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, use recent_N=10 for both demand mean and std (captures the last ~10 weeks of elevated demand while smoothing noise). This increases base_stock to meet service while sigma recent_N raises safety stock; default L keeps pipeline timing consistent and avoids over-attributing delays. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments needed because arrivals have been reliable.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded lead-time observations are 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P17 arrived same period), so use promised lead time (default). Demand has shifted up from the historical Jan samples (mean\u224835.6) to sustained higher weekly demand across recent periods (many weeks with demand ~65\u2013127). To capture the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand parameters, using the last 10 observed weekly demands to estimate (1+L)-period demand and volatility\u2014this balances service (to avoid stockouts given recent high sales) against holding cost by focusing on recent regime rather than dilute with the low historical Jan samples.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been significantly higher than the Jan baseline: mean of the last 10 weeks (Periods 9\u201318) = 84.4 units/week, indicating a sustained elevated demand regime. All observed lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the most relevant recent mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid frequent stockouts given current ~84/wk demand) against holding cost by not relying on old low-demand samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show promised lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 14-19) is materially higher and more volatile than early samples (values: 82,127,114,97,108,124), so I focus the forecast on that recent regime. Set L=default to trust promised 0 lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand observations) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this raises the base stock to meet elevated demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock aligned to recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 4 (sustained higher regime through Period 20). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (N=17 covers the 17 periods since the detected shift at Period 4). This raises the base_stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts while limiting over-ordering by using recent samples rather than the long-run historical mean.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime vs the early 2019 samples, so base forecast on recent data to capture elevated mean and volatility. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last ~10 weeks of demand (captures the elevated demand regime) while keeping L=default so OR backend uses promised lead time. This raises base_stock to protect service level given profit=holding cost, while recent_N volatility limits excessive safety stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent weeks show materially higher weekly demand (many weeks ~80\u2013110) while on-hand=9 and in-transit=0, so we must rely on the backend's baseline forecast. All observed lead times have been 0 periods (orders concluded show lead_time=0). I select default lead time so promised 0 is used. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this leverages full-sample statistics while the backend's capped-order logic will limit order size given volatility and holding cost tradeoff.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 across all prior periods (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows sustained relatively high weekly demand since early periods; no new 3+ period regime change detected beyond previously recorded insight. To keep the OR engine aligned with its assumptions, use default population estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost under symmetric profit=holding ($1/$1).

I therefore keep promised lead time (default) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend's service-level cap manage safety stock given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods ~13-25) show substantially higher demand (many weeks 65-125) than early historical samples. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0. Set demand forecast using recent_N with N=20 to capture the elevated recent mean and recent volatility; same N for sigma to reflect current variability. These parameters bias the base-stock upward to reduce lost sales given current high demand while the sigma update moderates inventory to limit holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods ~13\u201325) show a materially higher demand regime (~70\u2013100 weekly) versus the small-sample historical mean (35.6). Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so keep L as default. To capture the recent high-demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent window (N=10) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet current demand while capping orders via its cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts against high recent demand) versus holding costs given current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=19, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs. early 2019 samples. Actual lead times observed in concluded history are 0 consistently, so keep L as default (promised=0). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 20 samples to reflect current mean demand across the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to service elevated demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Current on-hand=19, in-transit=0; recent weeks show typical weekly demand ~60-110 with occasional spikes and some low weeks (e.g., Period 26 demand=43). All observed concluded lead times = 0 so far. To avoid overfitting to short swings and because profit=holding (q=0.5) the OR backend's base-stock should use aggregate historical mean and volatility. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding. This also keeps policy robust given no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift and limited in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: 78,43,76,68,64) averages ~65.8 which better reflects current regime than whole-sample mean. I use promised lead time (default=0) and recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock sized to the near-term observed demand and recent volatility, avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all past orders arrived same period). Demand has been much higher than the very early samples (recent weeks show sustained higher weekly demand). To reflect the persistent elevated demand I use a recent-window demand estimate while trusting promised lead time. This keeps L=default (promised=0) so arrivals are modeled correctly, and sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 20 weeks to capture the current higher mean and volatility, improving service level while avoiding excess stock from long-ago low-demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods, so keep L as promised (default). Demand has been at a higher regime vs. the very early samples; to capture the recent elevated average I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 (captures the most recent demand regime while capping at 20). Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine apply its usual safety buffer. These choices balance higher recent demand (to avoid stockouts) while using default sigma to avoid overreacting and incurring holding cost.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: 68,64,78,67,62) averages ~67.8 \u2014 use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime versus early-sample mean.

Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded orders show lead_time=0) so use default promised lead time. Recent demand shows elevated weekly demand vs early history; use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand observations: 64,78,67,62,101) to capture current regime for both mean and volatility. This yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on last 5 weeks and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on last 5 weeks, providing responsive replenishment while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has fluctuated around ~60\u201380 with occasional spikes (eg P33=101) but no new 3+ period sustained shift since the previously recorded Period 4 insight. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently (every Period 1\u201337 conclude lists arrived units with lead_time 0). Current inventory: on-hand=15, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given stable observed lead time and no new sustained demand regime change, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance to set base stock and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand history shows lower weekly demand (~50-80 range) but earlier carry-over insight recorded a prior regime shift. To let the OR engine use full-sample statistics and promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base-stock using all historical samples.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 every observed period (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Profit=1 and Holding=1 imply q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock equals mu_hat; using defaults keeps OR backend forecast anchored to full historical mean and volatility. I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting it set the order-up-to level while avoiding manual overreaction to short recent dips.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 36-40) has been lower (46,58,50,30,28) than the long-run average; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments (all concluded lead_times=0). To avoid excess holding cost at equal profit and holding ($1/$1) while maintaining service, I use recent demand stats to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. I choose L=default (promised lead time=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture the recent lower regime (N=5 chosen as the recent regime length=5). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These parameters reduce overstock risk versus using all-sample averages.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods; recent demand (Period 41)=22, but overall history contains substantial variability. No evidence of lost shipments or a sustained new lead-time regime. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean/variance (1+L scaling) and balances profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently; no lost shipments observed. Recent demand (last several weeks) is moderate (~30\u201345) after earlier higher regime; however change is not a new sustained shift requiring override. Use promised lead time to keep model aligned with observed arrivals. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap from full history; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). No explicit safety inflation beyond backend defaults.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen versus earlier periods (last 3 concluded demands: P41=22, P42=45, P43=29; recent mean\u224832), so I reduce forecast to reflect the new low regime. Use promised lead time (historical observed lead times = 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the current lower mean/volatility and avoid excess holding costs while preserving service.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical series shows an earlier sustained upward regime (carry-over), but recent 4 concluded weeks (Periods 41-44 demands = 22,45,29,18; mean=28.5) indicate lower demand in Dec. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (all prior concluded lead_times=0). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) but use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the latest low-demand regime; this reduces target base_stock and holding risk given equal profit/holding (q=0.5, z*=0).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 41-45) = [22,45,29,18,20] \u2014 lower than mid-year peaks and showing subdued pre-Christmas sales in this SKU despite calendar suggesting possible holiday uplift. All observed lead times = 0 (orders historically arrive same period). To keep service responsive to the most recent demand regime while avoiding excess holiday-era holding cost (profit and holding cost equal), I use L=default (promised lead time 0) and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent 5 periods (captures current low regime). These parameters steer the OR engine to base stock tuned to the recent lower demand while still reflecting short-term variability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent weeks (Periods 39-46) show consistently lower weekly demand (~18\u201345) than the mid-year highs, and on-hand=4, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. No concluded late or lost shipments observed (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). I keep L at the promised/default (0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0 and there is no evidence yet to increase lead time. For demand I use recent_N on the last observed regime to capture the sustained downward demand pattern and reduce base stock compared to long-run averages: select N=8 (Periods 39-46) which is the recent regime length. Apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well so variability reflects the recent quieter weeks. These choices lower the target base stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the observed lower demand environment.
