Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable demand: [148,133,150,139,160], mean \u2248146.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed. Promised lead time is used (default) because no concluded lead-time evidence exists. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast that balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding_cost (q=0.5). This avoids overfitting to short-term noise when no regime change is evident.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (seed): [148,133,150,139,160]; Period1 demand=144. Recent concluded arrival shows lead time = 0 (order placed P1 arrived P1). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift. Use default lead time to trust promised L=0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping the base-stock anchored to historical mean/variance and balancing Profit=Holding cost symmetric tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0 in both concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; demand history (five weekly samples Jan 2019) has mean ~146 and moderate volatility (~10.4). I set L=calculate to use the average observed lead time (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each) and no strong evidence of a regime shift. No overdue shipments detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand higher than single shipments (Periods 1-3: demands 144,165,184). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover expected weekly demand. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history confirms same-period lead time, so set L by default. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (mean of provided samples = 146). With profit=holding ($1 vs $1) the backend will target q=0.5 (z*=0), so base_stock\u2248mu_hat, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Profit: $153.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent periods show rising demand (Period1-4 sold: 144,165,184,188) and confirmed lead time = 0 from carry-over. On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must cover immediate demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. To capture the recent upward demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (uses last 4 observed demands) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean \u2248 (1)*170.25. To reflect recent volatility, I use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 (std of last 4 samples) so safety stock scales to recent variability. These choices prioritize service (meet rising demand) while keeping holding cost in check by using a short recent window rather than all historical older low-demand data.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18. On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently (P1-P5). Use calculated L to reflect observed lead time; use default demand/volatility (uses all samples) so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been high and volatile (period demands: 144,165,184,188,170,204) but historical sample set is available. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in prior conclude messages. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so service tradeoff is balanced. I will keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, allowing the backend to incorporate full historical variability into the base-stock and the capped order cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0; keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand has trended up (last several weeks higher than earlier samples), so set mu_hat using recent_N to focus on recent demand (N=5) to raise the base stock appropriately while sigma_hat remains default to let backend compute volatility from full history. This balances service (capture the recent demand increase) against holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained upward shift: Periods 4-8 demands = [188,170,204,257,394] (mean=242.6) vs historical sample mean\u2248150. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. To protect service during this higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 5 weeks (captures the current higher mean and increased volatility). This increases target base stock to cover the new demand level while sigma from the same window raises the safety-stock component to handle observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4 (Periods 4-8): avg demand increased from ~150 to 242.6 (+61.7%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I select L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 4-9) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These settings keep the base-stock tied to the elevated recent demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean through Period 10). To capture the elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201310, length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand. L uses promised/default (observed 0). This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost by using recent realized demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0; recent demands have remained elevated since Period 4 with a further sustained uptick from Period 8 onward. To capture the most recent regime, set L to default (promised 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 8-11) to reflect the latest higher-demand regime and keep orders responsive while limiting holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg demand for Periods 8-11 = 284.75 vs previous recent avg 242.6 (Periods 4-8) => +17.5% (Periods 8-11 sustained 4 periods).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 8 (Periods 8-11 avg \u2248 284.75). Current on-hand=60, in-transit=0; recent demands remain well above the early-period baseline so I bias forecasts to the most recent regime. Set L to default (promised 0, confirmed). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (most recent sustained regime length = 4 periods: Periods 8-11) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 4 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture realized volatility in that same regime. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given profit=holding.

Recent history shows sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 4\u201311 (peaks around P8\u2013P12); last few periods remain volatile. To bias forecasts toward the recent elevated regime while smoothing short-term noise, use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the most recent 5 demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders each period). Demand has been volatile with an elevated regime beginning Period 4 and a further uplift noted around Period 8; recent 8-week window (Periods 7-14) captures both the elevated demand and recent drop-offs, so I use that window for forecasting. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the current mixed/high-volatility regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248218.75 units). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect observed variability (sample std \u2248112, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2248112). These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the elevated recent average while explicitly accounting for high volatility to avoid excessive stock given holding cost = profit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=171, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead time=0. Recent demand (Periods 13-15) = [60,69,48], avg \u2248 59, a large sustained drop vs prior regime (Periods 8-11 avg \u2248 285). I treat lead time as promised (0). For demand I detect a changepoint starting Period 13 and therefore use recent_N=3 to compute mu_hat (covers review+lead) and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime and reduce replenishment. This reduces overstock risk given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) and current high on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand (Periods 13-15) = 59 vs previous avg 284.75 (Periods 8-11) => -79% (sustained 3 periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=123, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0). Demand recently fell sharply starting Period 13: Periods 13-16 demands = [60,69,48,48] (avg ~56.25), a sustained low-demand regime (3+ periods). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (choose N=4 = length of the recent regime) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and avoids overstock. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices reduce ordering toward the lower, sustained demand while keeping service vs. holding cost balanced (profit=holding so q=0.5 implies moderate safety stock from backend).

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=90, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has shifted down starting Period 13 (Periods 13-17 demands = 60,69,48,48,33; recent average \u224851.6), a sustained low-demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the lower recent mean across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to earlier high-demand regimes and limit overordering given zero in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (arrivals matched orders P1\u2013P18), so use calculated lead time. Demand has fallen sharply starting Period 13 and has been low and stable for 6 periods (Periods 13\u201318: 60,69,48,48,33,31). On-hand=59, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty so we should size orders to the new lower regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (N equals the 6-period recent regime), which reduces target base_stock and lowers holding cost while preserving service for current demand. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding so the OR backend will use the reduced demand estimates to scale orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has fallen and stayed low since Period 13 (Periods 13-19 mean \u224847); on-hand=23, in-transit=0 so current cover is ~0.5 weeks at recent demand. Historically lead time observed = 0 (concluded arrivals). To avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding ($1/$1 \u2192 q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), I use the promised/default lead time and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent low-demand regime (last 7 periods) so the OR backend sizes orders to match the new lower demand and low desired safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods. Recent demand has been in a lower post-Period-13 regime (Periods 13-21: 60,69,48,48,33,31,36,72,72) \u2014 sustained lower mean vs earlier spikes. To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time use L=default (promised=0). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 13-21, length=9) to capture the new lower average and recent variability: mu_hat -> recent_N N=9, sigma_hat -> recent_N N=9. These choices keep orders responsive to current low-demand regime, avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, and ensure the OR backend computes base-stock for (1+L) review+lead period using the most relevant samples.

Recent demand (Periods 18-22 = 31,36,72,72,40) shows a moderate uptick vs the low mid-May\u2013June regime; use a recent-window forecast to capture current level while avoiding overreacting to single spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent through history). Recent demand has settled into a low regime: last 5 demands (Periods 20-24) = [72,72,40,31,64], mean\u224855.8. To match current regime and avoid excess holding given profit=holding (service quantile q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), I select L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect the latest low-demand mean/variance so the OR backend targets ~56 units base stock and reasonable variability for orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1-P25 arrivals on-order). Demand dropped sharply starting Period 13 and has remained lower and more volatile through Period 25; I therefore forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (covering Periods 13-25) so the OR engine bases base_stock on the current low-demand mean and measured volatility, reducing excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-26). Demand regimes: earlier spikes (P4\u2013P11) then sharp drop starting P13 sustained through P26 (Periods 13\u201326 low-demand regime). To avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding (q=0.5 -> conservative stock), set L=default to use promised lead time=0. Use recent_N for demand and volatility to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (capture last 14 periods, P13\u2013P26) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and variability, reducing target base_stock and limiting orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13; last 8 concluded weekly demands (Periods 20-27) average ~50 units/week. To avoid excess holding while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 8 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low regime and recent volatility. This keeps base-stock tuned to current demand and limits holding cost with conservative pipeline sizing.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history: lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed arrivals P1\u2013P28). Demand shifted down sharply starting Period 13 and has stayed at a lower regime through Period 28 (sustained ~13 periods). On-hand and in-transit are zero, so we must size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current low-demand regime. Therefore: use L=default to trust promised lead time=0; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to capture the new mean/variance (regime length=13 \u2192 N=13). This biases the base-stock to the current low demand and reduces excess holdings while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 20-29) appears to form the current regime (samples: 72,72,40,31,64,43,30,48,69,63), recent mean \u2248 53; use recent_N=10 to forecast (mu_hat) and recent volatility (sigma_hat) so the OR backend sets base_stock to match the current lower-summer demand profile and avoid excess holding while preserving service given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 26-30) = [30,48,69,63,72], recent mean = 56.4 units; this reflects the sustained lower summer demand versus spring spikes. Use L=default (promised 0, confirmed), set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding, and set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (all observed arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 13 (sustained \u22483+ periods through Period 31); recent weekly sales mostly in the 30\u201370 range. To avoid overstock given profit=holding, I adopt promised lead time (default L=0) and use a recent_N demand estimate over the current low-demand regime (Periods 13\u201331, 19 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to current lower mean and volatility and reduces holding cost risk. This keeps pipeline + on-hand aligned to expected (L+1)-period demand and avoids large replenishments given only 2 on-hand and no in-transit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across many periods) and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 13. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201332, 20 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower average and volatility; this keeps base-stock conservative to avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand regime is the low-demand regime starting around Period 13; last 5 realized demands (Periods 29-33) average ~57.8 units with moderate variability. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting current low demand, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the latest low-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine will target a much lower base-stock appropriate for current demand.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep pipeline aligned with the latest lower-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent observations (recent_N=5) to capture the current regime and its volatility for the OR engine.

Demand has been in the low regime since the confirmed drop at Period 13 (sustained low demand through recent periods). To make the forecast responsive to the low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=20 (capped by rule) to capture the most recent ~20 weeks while smoothing older high-demand spikes. These parameters keep target base stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service given current low demand and zero lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 13 (sustained low sales through recent periods); to capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 for demand mean and volatility (captures most recent ~20 weeks). This will reduce mu_hat and sigma_hat versus long-run averages, lowering target base-stock and avoiding excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1 -> q=0.5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand (Periods 33-37 = 70,25,19,13,21) shows the low regime persists (recent mean ~29.6). To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) I use the promised/default lead time and a recent-window demand forecast to capture the low-demand regime. Set L=default to trust confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets a low base-stock appropriate for the sustained low demand and minimizes holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows lead time consistently 0 (arrivals same period across concluded periods) and no new sustained demand regime shifts since prior insights. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment to meet immediate demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this leverages full sample set given no new confirmed regime change and matches confirmed zero lead time. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> target z\u22480).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been low and variable after earlier spikes; last 5 demand samples (Periods 35-39 = 19,13,21,44,41) yield a recent mean ~27.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (short, recent regime length = 5). Sigma set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward stocking for the current lower mean while preserving buffer for observed variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has settled much lower than the high-spring spikes; last 8 concluded demands (P33-P40) = [70,25,19,13,21,44,41,58] \u2192 avg \u2248 34.9. To keep service while minimizing holding (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5 so z\u22480), I use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from a recent window to reflect the current low-demand regime. This reduces overstock risk given small on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0, so use default promised lead time. Demand has undergone multiple regime shifts earlier (big peak in Periods 4-11, then collapse around Periods 13-15). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 37-41 = 21,44,41,58,73) suggests a modest uptick vs the deep trough; to capture the latest level and variability I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (this sets (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the last 5 samples). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the most recent demand regime while relying on confirmed lead-time=0 to avoid over-ordering given holding cost = profit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many arrivals recorded same period), so use calculated lead time (avg observed). Demand: recent one-week spike at Period 42 (542) appears to be a one-off (Black Friday week) vs. a stable pre-spike regime (Periods 38-41 mean \u224854). I treat the spike as transient and forecast using the recent stable regime (Periods 38-41) to avoid overstocking after a promotional surge. Therefore: L set by calculate (reflecting observed 0); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 (capture the most recent stable regime). This balances service (cover near-term demand) while limiting holding cost risk from the isolated spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-43) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2014 actual lead time confirmed 0; use calculated lead time. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick in the last 5 periods (Periods 39-43: demands = 41,58,73,542,297) likely due to promotional/holiday effects; to capture this regime I use a recent_N=5 forecast for mean and std (covers the recent surge while weighting recent volatility). These parameters aim to raise the base-stock to meet elevated near-term demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to control holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in many concluded periods (orders consistently arrived same period). Recent weeks (Periods 42-45) show very high and volatile holiday demand (demands: 542,297,132,475) indicating elevated short-run mean and higher volatility. To capture recent holiday uplift I set L=default (promised 0). For demand level I use EWMA_gamma to emphasize recent high weeks (gamma=0.3) so the OR backend raises base-stock toward current peak while still smoothing. For volatility I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the recent high variance over the past two months without overfitting single-week spikes. These choices prioritize service during the holiday surge while limiting excessive inventory once demand reverts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has a strong holiday/high-volatility regime (Periods 42-46 demands = 542,297,132,475,271; recent average elevated). On-hand = 119, in-transit = 0; to avoid stockouts during sustained high recent demand, I set L using calculated (confirmed 0) and forecast demand using the most recent short window to capture the holiday spike. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to cover the elevated recent mean and measured volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so z*=0.
