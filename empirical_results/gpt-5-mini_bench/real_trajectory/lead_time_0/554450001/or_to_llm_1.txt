Calendar/context: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (just before Christmas) and product is seasonal apparel (jeans) \u2014 elevated footfall and gift purchases likely. Recent history shows large spikes (Period 42 demand=499) and several weeks >150, so downside risk of stockout during holiday. Profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 fractile=0.8) favors stocking to avoid lost sales. Given same-period arrivals (L=0) our order will immediately augment availability for holiday demand. I therefore increase OR's recommendation moderately to cover potential surge while limiting holding cost: order 200 units (adds 200 to on-hand during period demand), raising immediate available stock to 261 which covers a high-demand week without extreme overstock.
