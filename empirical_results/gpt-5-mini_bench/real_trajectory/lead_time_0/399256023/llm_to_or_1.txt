Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Demand history shows five weekly samples (36,54,62,60,113) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 and no 'conclude' arrival messages to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time is used (default) because there is no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Use default demand sizing and volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to avoid overfitting to recent noise before any confirmed regime shift. This balances service level vs. holding cost conservatively given current zero inventory and limited history of shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=148 (sold 65 due to stockout) vs historical sample mean=65 (samples: 36,54,62,60,113). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last order (P1) arrived with lead_time=0 as promised. No sustained changepoint: single high demand period likely stock-constrained. Use promised lead time and historical averages to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps, avoiding overreacting to one noisy high-demand observation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized demand (Period1=148, Period2=171) is substantially above the Jan samples (36,54,62,60,113), indicating a recent upward demand regime beginning this Feb. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and observed lead times for concluded orders are 0 (orders in P1 and P2 arrived same period). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 0-period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent uplift while meeting the rule minimum N=3 (last three samples: P2:171, P1:148, 2019-02-04:113) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean across the review+lead period. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These parameters bias the backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given zero pipeline and strong recent demand, while keeping variability grounded in the most recent samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (concluded periods 1-3) is 148, 171, 131 \u2014 a sustained higher regime vs earlier sample history (historical sample mean=65). On-hand=13, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times for concluded orders are all 0. I set L to calculate (average observed lead times = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses the three most recent concluded demands). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping sigma based on recent variability so safety stock is responsive without overstocking given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: recent avg = 150 vs historical sample avg = 65 (+130%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) is consistently elevated: demands = [148,171,131,104], recent mean \u2248 138 vs historical sample mean \u2248 65 \u2192 confirmed upward regime. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. To capture the new regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 4 periods (regime_length=4) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand and recent volatility; L kept default to use promised 0 and avoid over-correcting for lost shipments (none observed). This balances higher service level for the sustained demand spike while avoiding extra holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has fallen from an initial spike (Periods 1-3) toward lower values in Periods 3-5 (131,104,72). On-hand=67, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments and all past orders concluded with lead_time=0. Use promised lead time (default) since observed arrivals confirm 0. To reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid overstock from the earlier spike, set mu_hat using recent_N (last 3 periods) so the forecast weights current lower demand (reduces over-ordering). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture current demand volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Demand history (P1\u2013P6 demands = 148,171,131,104,72,119) shows a recent softer regime vs the early spike; last 3 periods (P4\u2013P6) average demand \u2248 98. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given 6/6 concluded arrivals at 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (reduces overstock vs using the early spike). This balances service (covering ~1 period ahead) with high holding cost ($1/unit/period) by avoiding inflation from older high-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand has been elevated and volatile (periods 3-7 demands: 131,104,72,119,168). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected immediate demand. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals; use default promised L=0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while smoothing noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 3-7). This yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on recent behavior to improve service while sigma from recent_N reflects current volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods, so keep L = promised (default). Recent demand (Periods 6-8 = 119,168,142; avg \u2248 143) remains well above older historical samples, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current elevated mean and volatility and to ensure the OR base-stock targets service for the near-term higher demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has risen above historical sample mean (historical mean=65); last 5 realized demands (Periods 5-9) = [72,119,168,142,91], avg\u2248118.4. On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Use promised/default lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Forecast using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime seen since Period 5; sigma also from recent 5 to reflect current volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the elevated demand while the OR engine's cap will limit extreme orders and balance holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=50, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use a recent-window demand estimate (5 periods) with L=default so mu_hat=(1+L)*recent mean \u2248117.8. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility) since no sustained variance regime change detected. This balances replenishment to cover expected near-term demand while limiting inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Historical sample mean = 65 (from early Jan samples) but recent periods (P1\u2013P11) show a sustained higher demand regime (Period 1\u20133 spike previously noted; subsequent weeks remain elevated and variable). On-hand=46, in-transit=0 so we must account for (1+L) periods of demand. Promised lead time observed consistently as 0 in concluded messages, so keep L=default. To capture the recent higher mean and current volatility, use recent_N over the last 11 concluded demand observations (Periods 1\u201311) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base_stock on the current regime rather than long-ago low historical samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than the older low mean.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-12) consistently show actual lead_time=0 (arrivals always same-period) and no missing shipments. Recent demand has fluctuated (high early spikes P1-3, then moderate weeks P9-12). Given confirmed 0 lead time and mixed demand with no sustained new signal beyond the previously recorded regime shift, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to full historical data, avoiding overreacting to short-term spikes while balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=51, in-transit=0, no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 so default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand (Periods 12-14 = 60,43,45) is lower than the early 3-period spike; the previously recorded regime shift (Periods 1-3) is not persisting. Profit and holding cost are equal so critical fractile q=0.5 (z\u22480), meaning the OR backend will target mean demand; to avoid unnecessary inventory I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given no evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time change and zero in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand has moderated compared with the early high spike; to capture the current regime I use recent samples. I keep promised lead time (default) since concluded history shows L=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand observations) to make the forecast responsive to the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given equal profit and holding cost.

Recent demand shows elevated but variable sales: last 5 demands = [43,45,70,115,148], recent mean=84.2. All observed lead times concluded as 0, so use promised lead time. To respond to the recent regime while limiting inventory, set L=default (promised=0), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest demand pattern, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (matches current higher demand) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). All observed concludes show lead_time=0 historically (no delays); on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been higher and more variable than early historical samples (last 5 demands: 70,115,148,92,81 => recent mean ~101, elevated vs earlier baseline). No sustained new lead-time signal or multi-period drop/spike beyond recent volatility. Set L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime and for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility, so the OR backend increases base-stock and safety stock appropriately while avoiding overreaction to single-period noise.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows a higher regime vs early samples (carry-over noted previously). Use promised/default lead time to reflect consistent observed 0 LT. For demand forecast I use a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the more recent demand regime (Periods 16-21) and avoid overweighting early low/high outliers; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost given profit=holding (q\u22480.5) so we favor a forecast anchored to recent mean rather than long-run average.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed lead_times = 0 (orders always arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 20-22 = 82,131,145) shows a higher short-run mean (~119) than long-run; to capture this uptick use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility with N=3. These parameters will raise base_stock to cover the short-run demand increase while the OR backend caps ordering to limit excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has trended higher: Periods 21-23 demands = 131,145,123 (avg=133). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must target (1+L)-period coverage for the elevated regime. Historical observed lead times in concluded messages are consistently 0, so keep L=default (promised). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed short, sustained high-demand regime (Periods 21-23). This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased short-term volatility; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no overdue shipments visible.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 21-23: recent avg = 133 vs historical sample avg = 65 (+104%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weeks (P21-23) showed a short high-demand regime previously recorded; P24 pulled back to 70 so no new sustained shift. On-hand=63, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically observed=0. To avoid overreacting to the P24 dip while respecting past regime volatility, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine leverages full historical mean/variance. This balances service (captures earlier high-demand periods) against holding costs given current on-hand coverage.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows arrivals always concluding with lead_time=0; on-hand=10, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demand has varied but no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded insights. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding and z*=0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened from the earlier high regime (Periods 21-23 avg=133) \u2014 last 3 realized demands = [70,88,120], recent avg ~92.7. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. To react quickly to the recent lower demand while still covering immediate (L+1) period demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures latest regime drop and short sample size). This biases orders toward current demand and reduces holding cost risk versus using long-run averages.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0. Recent demand has shown regime shifts earlier (Periods 1-3 and 21-23) and the most recent realized demands (Periods 25-27 = 88,120,96) suggest a higher short-run mean (~101). To be responsive to the current short-run demand level while keeping the backend's (1+L) aggregation consistent, I use default promised lead time and recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the last 3 observed demands and captures recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent elevated demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (no delayed/lost shipments), so keep L = default (promised 0). Recent demand is elevated versus very early historical samples; use recent demand to set demand forecast. Use recent_N N=5 (last 5 periods: P24-28) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older low samples. This balances service (capture ~100 units weekly demand) against holding cost by grounding estimates in the most recent 5 observations.

No concluded evidence of lead-time slips or lost shipments (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To respond to the recent higher regime and keep service while avoiding excessive holding, I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility rather than diluted long-run averages.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 26-30) averaging ~101 units/week; no new sustained changepoint detected vs prior carry-over insights. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no delays observed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) review+lead window) so the OR backend will compute a base-stock near recent demand while balancing profit vs holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 service quantile ~0.5).

Recent demand (Periods 29-31 = 84,79,78) appears stable and lower than some earlier peaks; use a short recent window to capture current regime for both mean and volatility.

Recent demand (Periods 30-32 = 79,78,78) is stable around ~78 units; earlier regime shifts were recorded previously but the most recent 3-week window shows a lower/stable demand. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded evidence supports it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures current lower mean and volatility), which helps the OR engine compute a base-stock that avoids overstock given equal profit/holding costs and very low on-hand/pipeline. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has stabilized near ~80\u201390 units/week after earlier regime shifts; last 5 realized demands (Periods 29-33) = [84,79,78,78,87], avg \u224881.2. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we need to replenish for current period demand. All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0 (orders in Period X arrived in Period X), so use promised/default lead time. To keep service while limiting holding cost (profit=holding cost \u21d2 q=0.5), use a short-sample forecast: set mu_hat using the last 5 weeks to capture current regime and set sigma_hat from the same 5 samples to reflect observed volatility. This provides a responsive base-stock aligned to the recent demand level and avoids overstocking from older, higher-demand regimes.

To reflect the most recent regime and avoid overstock while preserving service, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 ( (1+L)\xd7recent mean ).

Use promised lead time (default L=0) since concluded history shows timely 0-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower mean and volatility, which will lower the base stock and cap inventory to balance service vs. holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for immediate demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes \u2014 last 3 concluded demands (Periods 35-37) = 54, 61, 70 (avg \u2248 61.7). To target current demand regime while limiting holding cost (profit=holding cost), use the promised/default lead time and base stock driven by the short recent regime. Selected L=default to reflect observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture immediate recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This produces a compact base-stock that balances service level against holding cost given no pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (all concluded messages report lead_time 0). Recent demand has fallen in late Oct: Periods 36-38 demands = {61,70,36} (3-period avg \u224855.7), noticeably below earlier weeks. To avoid excess holding cost while matching the recent lower demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (3-period sustained lower demand) so the OR backend will target a smaller base stock and lower safety stock, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 36-39) has been lower (61,70,36,41) \u2014 suggests short-term mean below long-run. Promised lead time is 0 and recent concluded arrivals confirm 0 historically, so keep L as default. To make the backend base-stock responsive to the recent downshift, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 4 periods (N=4) which captures the most recent regime while meeting the N bounds. This reduces order targets and holding cost risk given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders repeatedly arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 38-40: 36,41,31) is lower than earlier spikes; no new sustained regime shift detected. With profit=holding, target service quantile = 50% so base_stock \u2248 demand forecast; therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps parameters stable and avoids overstock given low recent demand and zero in-transit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. Recent demand has fallen vs earlier regime: last 3 demands (Periods 39-41) = [41,31,33], avg=35. On-hand=57, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence of lost shipments. Set mu_hat by recent_N (N=3) to target the current lower regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). Set sigma_hat by recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned with current low demand to avoid excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 39-41: recent avg = 35 vs historical sample avg = 65 (-46%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a low regime around Periods 39-41 (avg \u224835) but Period 42 rose to ~60; to be responsive to the most recent low-demand regime while limiting holding cost I use a short recent window. Set L to default (promised = 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures most recent 3 concluded demand observations from the low regime) so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent demand and reduce excess inventory risk while preserving service for near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Recent demands have trended low (Periods 41-43 demands = 33, 60, 40) indicating a lower demand regime vs historical samples. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use L=default (promised). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk while preserving service). This keeps target base-stock small ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and lowers safety stock reflecting recent low variability, balancing profit vs holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1/unit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has fallen versus earlier year: last confirmed demands (Periods 42-44) = [60,40,32] and prior 3-period regime (39-41) showed low avg ~35. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L=default. To reflect the recent low regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 3 samples (captures current mean \u224844 and reduced volatility) so the backend will target lower base-stock and avoid excess holding given Profit=Holding. This balances service vs. holding cost given small on-hand and no pipeline.

Recent demand has been low (Periods 43-45 demands = 40,32,35; recent avg \u224835) consistent with the previously recorded downward regime around Period 42. All observed lead times in history are 0 (orders conclude same period). To avoid excess holding on a clearly lower-demand regime, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 3 periods to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and lower volatility. This yields lower replenishment targets and reduces holding cost while maintaining service for current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Current on-hand=6, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since around Period 39 (demands ~30\u201341, P39\u2013P46 avg \u224839) and this lower level has persisted for 8 periods. Historical lead times have all been 0 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption consistent, set L=default (promised=0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 periods, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to limit holding cost while maintaining service for the currently lower demand.
