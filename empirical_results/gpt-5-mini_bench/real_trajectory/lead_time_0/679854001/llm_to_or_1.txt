Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or observed lead times yet. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 4.8 units/week. Given no evidence of a lead-time shift or demand regime change, use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service vs. holding cost conservatively while we await arrival/conclude signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) show low weekly demand (1,6,7,5,5). Period 1 conclude shows an isolated large realized demand (~18) but was stock-limited (only 5 sold). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. No sustained changepoint (only one high-demand period), and lead time was observed as 0 for the Period 1 order (arrived same period). Therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances avoiding overreaction to a single stockout-driven spike while allowing the OR backend to compute safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History: two concluded orders (P1,P2) both arrived with lead_time=0. Recent demand: historical Jan samples mean ~4.8 but two very large demands in P1=18 and P2=79 signal a possible upward shift but only 2 periods (insufficient to confirm a sustained regime). Use lead time estimate from observed concludes (calculate). To adapt to recent elevated demand without overreacting to only two points, set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.5) to weight recent periods more while retaining historical information. Volatility unclear and changepoint not yet confirmed, use default sigma_hat. These choices keep base_stock responsive to recent spike while avoiding overcommitment given limited evidence; using observed lead time=0 avoids unnecessary pipeline padding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent history shows three consecutive periods with zero on-hand and zero in-transit at period start, and three concluded orders all arrived with lead_time=0. Historical weekly samples from Jan (mean=4.8) contrast sharply with recent realized demand (Periods 1-3 demands = 18, 79, 56), indicating a sustained upward demand regime. On-hand + pipeline = 0, so we must cover next (1+L) periods from forecast. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time (evidence: arrivals in Periods 1-3 all show lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the last 3 demand observations). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the OR backend toward a larger base-stock to avoid severe stockouts given the sustained demand jump while letting the capped order constraint limit excessive exposure to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (arrived in P1,P2,P3 with lead_time=0); Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg=51 over P1-P3 vs historical Jan avg=4.8 (\u2248+962%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. History shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals in P1\u2013P4 all reported with lead_time=0). Demand regime shifted starting Period 1: recent demands (P1\u2013P4) = [18,79,56,71], far above older Jan samples. On-hand and in-transit = 0, so orders must cover current period demand. I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (regime length = 4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high-demand regime (captures mean and volatility over P1\u2013P4). This raises base_stock to meet service given profit=holding, while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock accounts for recent variability and avoids excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has jumped and remained high across Periods 1-5 (demands: 18,79,56,71,88). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Use observed lead-time data (all concluded lead_times=0) so set L by calculation. Capture demand using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the new regime (short history but sustained for 5 periods). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 so the OR engine targets a base-stock aligned with the elevated mean and measured volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1: avg demand = 62.4 over Periods 1-5 vs historical Jan avg = 4.8 (+1200%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). History shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1\u20136) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent weekly sales = [18,79,56,71,88,105], mean \u2248 69.5 over Periods 1\u20136 (vs historical Jan mean \u22484.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet the new high demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because arrivals have consistently concluded with lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new regime (regime length = 6), giving (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect observed variance in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward a much higher base-stock to avoid lost sales while recognizing holding cost equals profit so service level tradeoff is balanced by using recent regime stats.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (P1-P7). Demand regime is the elevated regime confirmed since Period 1 (avg \u224862 across P1-P6, recent growth through P7). I set L=default to use promised lead time=0 (confirmed by arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (the recent elevated regime length) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, capturing the new higher demand level and its variance to balance service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals with W=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and every period since P1 sold out, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L via calculate to reflect confirmed observed lead times=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime: last 5 observed demands = [71,88,105,110,161], mean = 107 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*107 (L=0). Volatility is set recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variance. These choices prioritize meeting the current elevated demand (reduce stockouts) while keeping holding exposure aligned to short lead time and observed variability.

Lead time confirmed 0 in concluded history. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime length 9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend stocks for the new high-demand regime while balancing holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 1 (weekly sales ~50\u2013161, recent avg ~62). On-hand=12, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; recent weeks show same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0 repeatedly). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed by multiple conclude messages). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the full recent high-demand regime (Periods 1\u201310) so the OR backend builds base-stock for the elevated demand and avoids stockouts given empty pipeline. This balances service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by using recent-regime statistics rather than low historical January demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (P1\u2013P11 arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 1 (samples P1\u2013P11: 18,79,56,71,88,105,110,161,108,77,116). To target service with minimal holding cost given Profit=Holding, I set L to be inferred from observed lead times and use recent_N for demand moments capturing the full confirmed high-demand regime (N=11). This supplies the OR backend with (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility reflecting current high demand and short lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P12) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift to much higher weekly demand since Period 1 (recent weeks far above Jan historical mean). Recent realized demands (P8\u2013P12) average ~119.8 units/week. To reflect the new high-demand regime while keeping lead-time inference simple and evidence-based, set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by arrivals) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current elevated demand and captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by grounding forecasts in the most relevant recent data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1..P13 all arrived same period). Demand regime has clearly shifted upward and sustained since Period 1 (recent high weekly sales vs small historical Jan samples). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N on the full post-shift regime (most recent 13 concluded periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the high-demand regime rather than the low historical Jan mean. This produces a base_stock tuned to current higher mean and updated volatility, letting the OR backend balance profit vs holding cost under the sustained higher demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P14) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 1 (recent weekly demands: P10\u2013P14 = [77,116,137,66,114]). To be responsive to the current high and variable demand while avoiding excessive holding, I use calculate for L (reflect observed lead times) and recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demand samples. This captures recent demand level/volatility and keeps orders adaptive to the current regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead_time=0 across many periods, and demand has sustained a higher regime vs historical Jan samples. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead_time=0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5 = last 5 demand samples) to capture the current high-demand regime (more responsive than full-history mean). This yields (1+L)-scaled mean and std based on the most recent 5 periods, helping the backend set a base-stock that balances high service (profit=$1) against holding cost ($1) under the confirmed fast replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand is in a sustained higher regime vs historical Jan levels. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected or overdue. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L based on observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use a recent_N window to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 weeks P12\u2013P16: demands 137,66,114,162,142 -> mean 124.2) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Sigma is set using recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed repeatedly) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1. I choose to set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0 actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201317: demands 66,114,162,142,130) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high during the sustained elevated demand while avoiding excess holding given symmetrical profit/holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To target service while limiting holding cost, I set L to default (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals). For demand forecast I focus on the recent regime: use recent_N with N=10 (captures the most recent 10 weeks of the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, producing a base-stock aligned to current elevated demand and appropriate safety stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 1 (weekly sold volumes ~50\u2013130) vs historical Jan averages ~4.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Lead time observations in concluded history are all 0 \u2014 use calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N to focus the most recent sustained high-demand regime (N=20 covers the recent weeks with consistent elevated demand). For sigma use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward a larger base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while using recent volatility to avoid extreme overstocking.

For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable high-demand regime, so the OR backend buffers enough stock for (1+L) periods while controlling holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical early Jan samples are tiny (mean\u22484.8) but a sustained high-demand regime has persisted from Period 1 onward (periods 1\u201325 show weekly demand mostly ~80\u2013140). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0. To avoid diluting the demand forecast with the small historical Jan samples, I use a recent-N demand estimate capturing the confirmed high-demand regime (use N=20 to span the most recent stable weeks). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to capture current volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the confirmed elevated demand while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P26 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (weekly sold frequently 60\u2013130); to capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the last 20 samples. L set to calculated average observed lead time (will be ~0). This keeps safety stock aligned with the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently (arrivals same period). Demand regime is the elevated regime that began in Period 1 and has been sustained (recent weeks average much higher than Jan baseline); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent data. Set L to default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher forecast to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 1 (sustained high weekly sales across P1\u2013P28), so forecast demand and volatility using recent data to capture current regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent 20 demand observations while limiting noise). These parameters keep orders aligned with the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking given zero lead time while balancing holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P29) show every order arriving same period -> confirmed lead time 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (weekly sold averages ~62 over P1\u2013P29 vs historical Jan mean ~4.8). Given zero pipeline and high ongoing demand, I set lead time based on observed history and use recent-sample forecasting to capture the elevated regime. L chosen by calculating observed lead times (avg=0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent sustained high-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules), so the OR backend will size base stock for the (1+L)-period demand using recent high mean and volatility, prioritizing service level while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding.

On-hand=6, in-transit=0 \u2014 coverage is effectively zero going into this period. Lead times have consistently concluded as 0 historically, so use promised lead time. To keep the forecast responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding dilution by the small pre-regime samples, use recent_N=20 for both demand mean and std (captures ~last 20 weeks of realized demand). This supports the OR base-stock calculation to replenish to service-level-driven targets while accounting for observed recent volatility.

Historical concludes (P1\u2013P34) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (weekly sales typically ~90\u2013120 in recent months). To reflect the sustained higher regime and recent volatility while honoring confirmed lead time, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base_stock and cap on the most recent 20 weeks of demand (captures current mean and variability while limiting noise from early low-demand history). This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than long-run low historical mean.

I set L via observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N=5 forecast (weeks P31\u2013P35 mean\u2248109.2) to capture current regime and avoid diluting with low Jan samples. Sigma use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to the high current demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a persistent high-demand regime since Period 1 (sustained weekly demand ~100+ vs historical Jan ~5). To let the OR engine use the full empirical demand picture (captures the sustained high regime) and because promised lead time = 0 is validated by arrivals, I select default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost with the backend's q-based safety stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand is in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (weekly sales frequently ~80\u2013130). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded history\u2014use promised/default. To capture the sustained high-demand regime while stabilizing noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 20 weeks (largest cap per rules) so the OR engine targets an appropriate base stock reflecting current demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than dilute with older low historical Jan samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime vs. historical Jan samples. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default=0) and estimate demand from the most recent 20 weekly samples to reflect the sustained elevated regime; apply the same recent-20 window for volatility so the OR backend sizes safety stock to current variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spring spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [79,74,52,41,?]. On-hand=59, in-transit=0 so we already hold ~1 week of recent demand. Lead time historically confirmed 0. I choose L by calculation (uses observed lead times average=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (shorter recent mean/volatility) so the OR backend will lower target base-stock and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given rapid same-period replenishment availability.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals each period). Demand has been high earlier in year vs Jan baseline, but recent weekly demand has cooled (last 5 concluded demands: P36-P40 = 79,74,52,41,20). I set L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (confirmed by arrivals). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the base-stock to the current, lower short-term demand regime and avoid excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit. This keeps (1+L)*mean based on the most recent 5 weeks and reduces orders compared with using all-time high means, balancing service level vs holding cost. Current on-hand (46) plus zero pipeline covers about one week of recent demand (~53 mean) so ordering to the recent_N-driven base stock prevents overstocking.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period). Recent demand has declined from summer peaks; a clear downshift began around Period 35 (weekly demands P35\u2013P41 = [84,79,74,52,41,20,22], recent avg \u2248 54 over P35\u2013P41 and \u2248 41.8 over last 5). To capture this recent lower regime while remaining responsive, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 7 observed demands (captures the post-Period-35 regime). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend reduce target base stock to match lower recent demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability, minimizing holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Recent weekly demand has softened vs mid-year peak (recent demands: P38\u2013P42 = 52,41,20,22,84).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (arrivals always same period). Recent demand has fallen since late Oct/Nov: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 39-44) = [41,20,22,84,33,35], avg \u224839.2. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving responsiveness given lead time=0, I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 6 samples; this reduces target base-stock and caps order volatility/holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 39: avg demand = 39.2 over Periods 39-44 (6 weeks), down substantially from prior mid-year averages (~100); lead time remains confirmed as 0 periods (all concluded arrivals same-period).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 periods across concluded history (many consecutive concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Demand has shifted down starting Period 39 (recent regime): periods 39-45 average \u224837.4 (periods 39-44 average previously recorded \u224839.2). I set L to default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent low-demand regime (Periods 39-45) to avoid overstocking given current low weekly demand and upcoming holiday week variability. I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility in this regime. These parameters prioritize avoiding holding cost while maintaining service for the lower recent demand level.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has declined since mid-year; Periods 39-44 recent regime avg \u224839.2 and last three concluded demands are 27, 31, 31 (P45-P46-P46 sold pattern), so I use a short recent window to forecast. Set L=default to trust promised 0 (matches observed). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (balances responsiveness to the downward shift vs. sample noise). This keeps base_stock aligned to current lower demand while the OR backend will compute safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff.
