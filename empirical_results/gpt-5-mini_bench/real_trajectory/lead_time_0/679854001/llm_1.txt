Cardigan (knitwear) is moderately seasonal for cooler months; no major holiday spikes in mid-Feb. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly samples for this SKU: [1,6,7,5,5] (weeks around Jan\u2013Feb 2019). Recent 4 samples average = (6+7+5+5)/4 = 5.75; overall recent central tendency ~5\u20136 units/week. c) Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). Must hedge between same-period arrival and possible delay. d) Inventory assessment: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so overstock is costly; aim to match expected near-term demand with little safety stock. e) Order decision: target to meet one week's expected demand (~5\u20136). To be conservative on holding cost and given risk of delayed arrival, order 5 units to cover the most likely demand while limiting potential holding/overstock penalty.",

With lead time=0, new orders will arrive in-period and can satisfy Period 2 demand.
