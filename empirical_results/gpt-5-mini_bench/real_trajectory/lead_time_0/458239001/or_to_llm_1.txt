Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 44\u201346) = 16, 20, 9; earlier spikes (Periods 42\u201343 = 57) look like isolated high demand weeks, not a sustained new regime. With L=0 we only need to cover this period's demand (L+1=1). OR recommends 42 using longer-run history; that would raise holding cost unnecessarily given current on-hand. Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 \u2192 moderate service target, but current on-hand already exceeds a reasonable forecast + safety (forecast ~20, safety ~5\u201310). Action: place no order to avoid holding cost and because same-period replenishment is available if demand jumps next period. Monitor next concludes for any sustained demand increase and revise if needed.",
