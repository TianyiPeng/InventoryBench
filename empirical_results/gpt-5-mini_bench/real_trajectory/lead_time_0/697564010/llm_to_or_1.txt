Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (0,2,10,16,24 through 2019-02-04). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover rising near-term demand. No concluded arrival messages exist to infer actual lead time, so use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast, use recent_N=5 to capture the upward regime across the five most recent samples; this yields a (1+L)-scaled mean that reflects the spike. For variability, use recent_N=5 so the OR backend sees elevated sigma from the recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed upward shift while letting the backend compute the base-stock and cap using current profit/holding parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04: samples [0,2,10,16,24], recent mean increased substantially vs earlier baseline (sustained 5-period rise).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04 samples [0,2,10,16,24]) shows a sustained demand increase; Period 1 conclude confirms actual lead time = 0 (ordered P1 arrived P1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment. I use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by observation) and default demand uncertainty so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This lets the backend apply the base-stock formula balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). Historical sample series [0,2,10,16,24] has mean 10.4 units/week (recent sustained 5-period rise recorded earlier). Periods 1\u20132 show stockouts (demand 20 and 55, sold 19 and 21) implying censored demand but no confirmed change in lead time. I therefore set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time; use default demand and volatility estimates (default mu_hat and default sigma_hat) to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances higher recent mean against holding cost by relying on backend's z*-cap logic while acknowledging censoring in recent sells.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 had lead_time=0 (arrived same period) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-3) = [20,55,81], indicating a sustained upward regime versus earlier historical samples. To capture the new high-demand regime and keep pipeline aligned with same-period arrivals, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the higher recent mean and volatility while respecting holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 concluded demands [20,55,81], recent mean=52.0 vs earlier baseline mean=10.4 (+400%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows arrivals same-period for P1-P4 (observed lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has a clear upward regime in the most recent concluded periods (demands = 20, 55, 81, 144); to capture this surge I use recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the new higher mean and spread. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the sustained spike) against holding cost by basing base-stock on recent realized demand rather than the long-run low baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the initial baseline (consecutive high-demand periods: 20,55,81,144,89) and arrivals have consistently shown lead_time=0. On-hand=31, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set lead time to promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over the (1+L) review+lead window using the last 5 high-demand observations, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent concluded demands show a sustained high-demand regime (periods 1-6 concluded demands = [20,55,81,144,89,157]); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0; use calculate to lock to observed average (0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (captures mean/volatility over the last 6 concluded periods) so the OR engine raises the base-stock and maintains service while keeping holding cost sensitivity via backend cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (orders from P1\u2013P7 all arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised=0). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since early Feb and especially from Period 4 onward (demands: 144,89,157,184), so use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 4 concluded periods to capture the new higher mean/volatility while meeting service levels without excessive holding. recent_N N=4 balances responsiveness and noise given a sustained 4-period high-demand regime. No overdue shipments detected. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts in the new regime while controlling holding cost via using recent data rather than all-history smoothing.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has risen and stabilized at a much higher level: last 5 concluded demands = [144,89,157,184,190], recent mean \u2248152.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover upcoming high demand. Lead time evidence from concluded periods shows arrivals same-period repeatedly (observed lead_time=0 each concluded order), so set L to be calculated from observations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. This increases target base-stock to meet service (profit>holding) while keeping volatility estimate based on the same recent window.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 consistently. Demand regime shifted earlier to a higher level (confirmed in carry-over). I use L=default to trust promised lead time (0). To capture the current high-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (periods 5-9 demands = [89,157,184,190,135], recent mean=151) so (1+L)*mean reflects current demand. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. No new sustained changepoint detected.

Actual lead times historically concluded at 0 periods; use calculated lead time to confirm.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201311) show all orders arrived same period (lead_time observed=0 consistently). Recent demand clearly in higher regime; last 5 concluded demands = [184,190,135,141,184] with recent mean ~166.8. No missing/overdue shipments to hedge against. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (review+lead multiple =1 period). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend a forecast centered on the sustained high-demand regime while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability and confirmed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed in Periods 1\u201311 all arrived same period).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes through Period 12 show sustained high demand since Periods 4\u201312 (recent demands: 190,135,141,184,205). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in history). To react to the elevated recent demand while avoiding excess holding, I use promised/default lead time (0) and set demand estimates using a recent-window of the last 5 concluded periods to capture the new high-demand regime. This provides the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast anchored to the most relevant recent data and a volatility estimate reflecting recent variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been consistently elevated across many periods (sustained high regime since early periods shown in history). On-hand=34, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrivals, so use default lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 8 demand samples; use sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet current demand while keeping variability estimation tied to the recent regime to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained higher-demand regime over the last several periods (recent demands: P10-14 = 141,184,205,164,232; recent mean=185.2). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock driven by current elevated demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since early periods (carry-over confirmed). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. To reflect the confirmed near-immediate replenishment and the elevated recent demand, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (last 5 periods' demands ~ mean 210.6). This balances service (capture recent high demand) against holding cost by avoiding dilution with older, low-demand samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Period 12-16 demands 205,164,232,268,270) and all concluded orders have lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to cover next-period demand. I set L to default (promised lead time, supported by repeated concluded lead_time=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (last 5 concluded demand samples) so the OR backend builds a base-stock matching the elevated mean while capturing recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given zero inventory) against holding cost by using a short lookback tied to the confirmed new regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-17) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained high weekly demand since Periods 4+). To reflect current high-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand weeks, which helps the OR backend target adequate service with controlled extra stock given the $1 holding cost and $4 profit tradeoff.

Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (confirmed Period 12) and a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (large, persistent increase vs baseline). No overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time 0. To capture the recent high-demand regime and keep service high given profit $4 vs holding $1 (service-prioritized, q\u22480.8), I use recent_N for demand stats using the last 10 demand samples to reflect the current elevated mean and volatility without overreacting to one-off weeks. Sigma also use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs the early 2019 baseline: last 10 concluded demands (P10\u2013P19) average 205 units/week. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). To align the OR backend to the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding costs controlled, I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility (captures the most recent stable 10-week regime). L uses default (promised lead time = 0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201321) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a higher sustained regime since early periods; to reflect the most recent demand level I use a recent-window forecast to capture current weekly mean/volatility (last 7 concluded demands cover Periods 15\u201321: [268,270,195,180,211,135,103], recent mean \u2248194.6). This keeps base_stock responsive to the elevated regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4. Methods chosen: L=default (trust promised/confirmed 0), mu_hat=recent_N to use the recent 7-period mean for (1+L)\xd7mean, sigma_hat=recent_N to use recent 7-period std for forecast volatility.

Demand has been elevated and then moderating recently (recent weekly demands 103,84). To let the OR engine use its full historical estimates and since there is no new sustained changepoint, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (maintain stock to meet recent mid-hundreds weekly demand) versus holding cost by relying on profit=4 and holding=1 in the internal q ratio.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has been at a higher sustained regime since early periods (carry-over: multi-period rise confirmed). Current inventory on-hand=149, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to typical weekly demand but demand variance remains high. Lead time history (concluded periods) shows consistent same-period arrivals; I keep L at promised (default). To capture the elevated recent demand level I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 12 observed demand periods to reflect the sustained high regime while smoothing older low values. This keeps the backend's base-stock responsive to the higher demand but reduced urgency to order immediately because on-hand is already high, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=191, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201324 arrivals same period). Demand has fallen from spring peaks (200\u2013270) to much lower recent weekly sales: last 5 concluded demands = [135,103,84,50,43], recent mean=83. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt the forecast and volatility to the clear downward regime over the last 5 periods, reducing overstock risk while preserving service level given same-day replenishment.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=157, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201325 arrivals same period). Recent demand has dropped vs earlier peak: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [103,84,50,43,34], recent mean=62.8 which is far below the earlier high-demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to promised (default, 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases orders on the most recent lower-demand regime (N=5 captures the sustained 5-period decline).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=133, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen steadily (Periods 21-26 demands: 103,84,50,43,34,24). Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Periods 1-24 arrivals all same-period). I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed concluded lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained decline over the last 6 periods so mu_hat reflects the lower current regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent reduced volatility. This reduces unnecessary holding while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline starting Period 21: avg Periods21-26=56.33 vs avg Periods15-20=209.83 (\u221273%), sustained 6 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 21 (Periods 21-27 low-demand regime). On-hand=111, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0; use observed average. To reflect the new low-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent sample window (last 7 periods, Periods 21-27). This reduces forecast and holding while preserving service. sigma_hat also uses the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 21-28 demands = [103,84,50,43,34,24,22,27]) shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 21 (8 periods) with recent mean ~48.4 units/week. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 in history and no new arrival data contradicts it. Given ample on-hand relative to the new lower-demand regime, I choose L=default to keep promised lead time, and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the lower recent demand (reducing new orders and holding cost exposure). This balances service vs holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting the promised lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods (all observed arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has declined and settled in recent periods (Periods 24-29 demands \u2248 [43,34,24,22,27,39], sustained lower regime). To reflect the new lower-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (still 0) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast over the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the most recent 6 demand samples, so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding costs while preserving service.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and there have been no arrivals/orders placed in Periods 25\u201330 (arrived=0), while demand has been low since Period 21 (decline sustained). Recent demand regime: Periods 21\u201330 demands = [103,84,50,43,34,24,22,27,39,48], sustained lower mean. Supplier previously had lead_time=0 through Period 24 but shipments stopped thereafter; this suggests possible lost/stopped shipments so use an explicit small positive lead-time to be conservative. Set L explicitly to 1. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the new lower regime (Periods 21\u201330). For volatility use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent variability. These settings reduce overstock risk given low recent demand and account for potential short supplier delay while letting the OR engine compute base_stock and cap accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Missing supplier shipments starting Period 25: no arrivals for orders placed P25\u2013P30 (6 consecutive periods), indicating supplier stoppage or lost shipments; demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (Periods 21\u201330 mean \u2248 47.4).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concl.: lead time has been 0 for many observed orders (supplier resumed arrivals in P31 after P25\u2013P30 outages). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (periods 21\u201331 concluded demands: [103,84,50,43,34,24,22,27,39,48,9], recent mean much lower than earlier peak). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand forecasts (captures last 11 periods in current regime). I keep lead time as default (promised=0, consistent with many observed 0 lead times and recent resumed arrivals). Using recent_N for sigma matches the same recent sample window so the OR backend balances service level to the lower demand while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand stock.

On-hand=71, in-transit=0; supplier resumed at P31 so promised lead time=0 remains appropriate. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=12 and sigma_hat recent_N N=12 so the OR backend forecasts using the current low-demand regime (reduces replenishment to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4).

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in almost all observed arrivals; recent demand declined since Period 21 (lower regime, sustained). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time (expected \u22480). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 21\u201333) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with the same N=13 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward the lower recent demand to avoid excess holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and zero visible pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 with on-hand=54 and in-transit=0; supplier previously had a stoppage (Periods 25\u201330 no arrivals) but later resumed (arrivals on P31 and P34). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times confirm L=0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to anchor mu_hat to the latest low-demand regime (captures Periods 25\u201334 demand sample set) so the base-stock targets won\u2019t over-order into a low-demand environment. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-volume periods. These choices reduce overstock risk given limited pipeline and elevated holding cost relative to profit.

Period 36 (2019-10-14).

On-hand=47, in-transit=0; no confirmed prolonged lead-time change (historical concluded lead times remain 0). To reflect the recent low-demand regime and short lead time, set L using observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-variance, low-mean regime (balances service vs holding cost by reducing forecast to recent demand levels).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (sustained lower demand; recent periods 27\u201336 show small weekly sales 9,11,9,9,7,6 etc.). Supplier previously had a 6-period gap (P25\u2013P30) but arrivals resumed with 0 lead time (orders that did arrive show lead_time=0). Given low recent demand and confirmed same-period arrivals when shipments occur, I choose L=default (promised lead time=0). To capture the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 demand observations (captures recent post-decline behavior while smoothing week-to-week noise). These parameters prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while providing enough stock for near-term demand and the 0 promised lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (recent week demand ~6\u201311). Supplier previously had a multi-period stoppage (P25\u2013P30) but arrivals resumed sporadically (P31,P34). Given many observed lead-times = 0, use calculated average lead time. For demand forecasting use a recent-window to capture the sustained lower regime: select recent_N to reflect the latest low-demand behavior while smoothing noise (N=7). Apply same recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders downward to avoid holding cost given low recent demand and zero visible pipeline while still covering (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been low and stable since the decline beginning around Period 21; most recent concluded demands (Periods 32\u201338) = [11,9,9,7,6,6,6], recent mean \u22487.7. On-hand=29, in-transit=0; no confirmed long lead-time (historical concluded lead times are 0 when arrivals occur) but supplier had a stoppage earlier\u2014so keep promised lead time. I set L=default so backend uses promised lead time (0). To capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, with N=7 (the 7 most recent samples, regime length=7). This focuses the forecast on the sustained lower demand, reducing over-ordering given holding cost. Using recent_N for sigma_hat lets the backend compute volatility from these same recent samples.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed arrivals but there was a supplier stoppage (P25\u2013P30 no arrivals) followed by a single arrival at P31 and then mostly zero arrivals; no new sustained lead-time change confirmed. Demand shifted down starting Period 21 and has remained in the lower regime through Period 39. I set L to 'calculate' (uses observed lead times = 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-change lower regime to capture the sustained lower demand: mu_hat recent_N N=19 (Periods 21\u201339). Volatility also from the same recent window: sigma_hat recent_N N=19. These choices bias orders toward the current lower-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time=0; with low in-transit and modest on-hand, the OR backend's base-stock will aim to cover (1+L) periods of the recent mean, limiting excess holding given the $1 holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals when shipments occurred) and a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 21 ( ~20 periods to present). Recent demand has been low and stable (many single- and teen-digit weekly sales), so I use the promised/default lead time and base forecast on the most recent regime. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 21\u201340). This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the lower-rate demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled into a low regime since Period 31: demands for Periods 31\u201341 = [9,11,9,9,7,6,6,6,8,8,6], recent mean \u2248 8.0 units/period and low variance. On-hand=45, in-transit=0; with promised lead time default (0) current stock already covers multiple weeks of this low demand. I set L=default to trust confirmed historical same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the OR engine to the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given holding cost; this keeps the base-stock tuned to recent mean demand rather than higher historical peaks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Current on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 21 (recent weekly demands mostly 6\u201311 over Periods 32\u201342). Lead times have been observed as 0 in concluded history (many orders arrived same period) and supplier stoppage from P25\u2013P30 was temporary (orders resumed P31+). To avoid overstock given high holding cost relative to profit, use recent demand estimates focusing on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen L=default to trust concluded evidence of 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent low-demand regime while smoothing short noise. This keeps base stock conservative to balance service level and holding cost given limited on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=31, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock covers multiple upcoming weeks at current rates. No new sustained lead-time change observed; supplier has intermittently supplied but promised lead time remains 0. To avoid overstock given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, keep promised lead time (default) and estimate demand using a recent-window to capture the low regime. Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised 0; mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 6 demand observations; sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent low variability and avoid inflated safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16): on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 21 (sustained low weekly sales ~2\u201311 lately). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0 in concluded periods and supplier resumed deliveries after earlier gaps, so use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent_N over the latest low-demand regime: choose N=20 (capped at 20) to capture sustained post-Period-21 behavior. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering versus long-ago high-demand periods while keeping safety stock for a short lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 21; last 10 concluded weekly demands (Periods 36\u201345) average ~5.9 units/week. Supplier lead time has repeatedly been 0 in concluded history. There is no new sustained changepoint since prior insights. I choose L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals historically confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current low-demand regime (stable ~6/week) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent std via recent_N to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward low base-stock (reducing holding cost) while preserving service for the observed low-demand regime and avoid replenishing against older high-demand samples.
