{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so orders placed now will arrive during this period (but will only be visible next conclude). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 59, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has shifted back to a higher regime since Period 30; last few weeks' demands (Periods 43\u201346 sold) = 65,46,85,93 (avg \u224872). Cost tradeoff: profit $19 vs holding $1 gives critical fractile q=0.95 (z\u22481.645), so high service level is justified. OR recommends 84 units using its capped base-stock \u2014 that aligns with covering ~1 period demand (L+1=1) plus safety stock given observed ~72 weekly demand and occasional spikes (e.g., past 100+ weeks). Action effect: ordering 84 will raise on-hand to ~143 upon arrival, sufficient to meet expected demand and protect against stockouts while holding cost is low. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 84 units.",
