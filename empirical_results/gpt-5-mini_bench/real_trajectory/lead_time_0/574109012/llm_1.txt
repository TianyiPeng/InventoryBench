Demand analysis: recent periods show a large, sustained surge. Periods 30-33 demands = 123, 139, 121, 216. Mean P30-P33 = 149.75/week, compared with prior elevated regime noted P25-P27 mean \u224819.7/week \u2014 this is a clear, sustained new high-demand regime (4 periods). Lead time & pipeline: historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage for this period. Inventory decision: with LT=0, orders placed now will arrive before demand. To capture sales and profit ($19/unit) and given holding cost is low ($1/unit/period), order roughly the recent observed demand level to avoid lost sales.
