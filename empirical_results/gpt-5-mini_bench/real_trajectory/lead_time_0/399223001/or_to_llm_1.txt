  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4). Therefore an order placed now will arrive in this same selling period and can be used to meet Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=167, in-transit=0.

Decision: increase order to bring available inventory closer to the demand-driven base-stock while limiting extreme overstock. With on-hand 167, ordering 250 raises available inventory to 417, closely matching the target \u2248422, providing high service for the current high-demand regime while keeping holding cost reasonable.
