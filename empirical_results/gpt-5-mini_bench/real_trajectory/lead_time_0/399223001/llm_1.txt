Inventory policy: profit per unit = $19 >> holding cost $1, so it's optimal to bias toward meeting demand rather than risking stockouts. Order decision: target about mean+1\u03c3 to cover variability (\u2248222.5+69\u2248292). Rounded to a practical whole-unit order of 290. This balances capturing high-profit sales while accepting modest holding cost risk.",
