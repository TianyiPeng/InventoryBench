Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [77,60,50,23,42], mean=50.4 units/week, sample std\u224820.13. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need cover for the current review+lead period. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (cover ~50 units this period) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (historical weeks) average ~50 units/week; Period1 sold 53, ending on-hand 15, in-transit 0. Last concluded arrival shows lead time 0 (Period1 order arrived same period). On-hand (15) plus no pipeline means replenish to cover ~1 period of demand. I choose L=default (promised 0, confirmed by observation), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect the long-run weekly mean \u224850, and sigma_hat=default to use historical volatility. These settings give the OR engine a baseline base-stock near historical demand while keeping holding cost pressure low given limited on-hand inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent confirmed arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for the last 2 orders (no delays). Demand in the most recent 3 weeks: 2019-02-18=69, 2019-02-11=53, 2019-02-04=42 \u2014 showing a modest uptick vs earlier Jan samples. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest regime (weeks with 69,53,42) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These settings raise the base-stock enough to improve service during the recent demand uptick while keeping holding cost in check because lead time is short.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01): [77,60,50,23,42], mean \u224850.4, recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). On-hand=38, in-transit=0 so pipeline < expected (1+L)*mean. Use promised lead time (default L=0) and default demand estimates so backend computes base stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full-sample stats; this balances service level (mean ~50.4 units/week) against $1 holding cost with profit $4/unit.

Daily Profit: $172.00, Daily Holding Cost: $24.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders each period arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 for P1\u2013P4) and recent demands: periods concluded demands = [53,69,29,43] plus earlier sample weeks. No clear demand regime shift; seasonality neutral in Mar. Use inferred lead time from observed concludes and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demands: [77,60,50,23,42] mean=50.4. On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so inventory is below a single-week expected demand; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes show 0 actual lead time. To keep policy simple and consistent with confirmed lead time and limited samples, use default demand estimates ((1+L)*mean) and default volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given current on-hand=20) against holding cost with no evidence of regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P6) consistently show actual lead time = 0. No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demands (53,69,29,43,45,24) fluctuate but not persistently higher or lower. Use default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, leveraging confirmed lead time=0 and avoiding premature tuning.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed across multiple periods). Demand history shows moderate, variable weekly demand with no clear seasonal spike by early April. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0 (matches confirmed observations). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level and holding cost given stable lead time and no strong recent demand shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P8) consistently show actual lead time = 0; no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138 = 43,45,24,38,30) appears representative of current regime (mean=36). To keep orders responsive with minimal holding, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the latest demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 = 36). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (~7.93). These parameters prioritize service (accurate short lead replenishment) while limiting excess inventory given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical recent demand (Periods 1\u20139) shows a lower, stable regime vs. the earlier Jan samples (P1\u2013P9 demands: 53,69,29,43,45,24,38,30,29). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To capture the current demand regime I use the last 9 periods for forecast and volatility (recent_N=9). This keeps target inventory aligned to observed recent demand and avoids overstock from earlier higher Jan samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P10) shows all orders arriving same period (lead time 0 confirmed). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. No sustained demand regime change detected; use defaults so OR backend uses full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This preserves service level given low holding cost vs profit and confirmed zero lead time.

Recent weekly demand has typically ranged ~25\u201345 units; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This keeps ordering responsive (same-period arrivals) while the OR engine balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weekly demand has stabilized in the high-20s/low-30s (last 5 demands: 30,29,28,25,40; mean\u224830.4). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 0. I set L=default (promised 0). To focus the base-stock on the recent regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets replenishment around the recent mean and observed volatility, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows sustained same-period arrivals (lead time 0) across many periods, so use observed lead time. Use calculate for L (average observed lead times = 0). Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided historical demand samples; this balances service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) without overstock given current on-hand and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P14 arrived same period). Profit/holding ratio (4/1) implies a high target service level; I'll rely on the backend's default demand estimates using all samples so the OR engine sets base-stock and cap appropriately. No evidence of recent demand regime shift or lost shipments; current on-hand provides modest cover but allow backend sizing.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows mostly stable weekly demand with one large spike (Period 15 demand=70) but otherwise moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and prior conclude messages confirm lead time=0. No evidence of lost shipments. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed by multiple concludes). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L), providing a balanced base-stock that reacts to the observed demand history while the backend cap limits extreme orders. This keeps service level reasonable after the stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 in Feb) plus full history through P16 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Recent two periods (P15-P16) had high demand (70s) but not a sustained 3+ period regime shift, so I will keep default statistical aggregation. Use promised/default lead time (0) so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples multiplied by (1+L). This balances service (captures overall mean) while avoiding overreaction to a short spike and limiting holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows a clear upward demand regime starting Period 15 (demands 70,72,78). Promised lead time is 0 and previous conclues confirm LT=0. To protect service while avoiding excess holding, set L=default to use promised 0. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (covering review+lead period = 1 period). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This targets higher base-stock to meet the sustained spike while keeping volatility estimate local to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand increased from ~35 (Periods 1\u201314) to 73.3 (Periods 15\u201317), +109%.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (higher mean). On-hand=25, in-transit=0; next-period arrivals occur after decision so no incoming stock visible now. I use L=default (promised lead time 0, matches observed arrivals). For demand I use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) to let the OR engine compute base_stock using full history including the post-shift data; sigma_hat=default to supply the engine with overall demand volatility. This balances higher recent demand with overall variability while avoiding overreacting to a single lower-than-peak week (Period 18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P19). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 and recent demand (P15\u2013P19 = 70,72,78,52,60) shows a sustained higher regime vs early periods; recent 5-week mean = 66.4. To keep service while controlling holding cost (profit/holding => q=0.8 => high fill target), use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the elevated demand level and recent variability. This balances higher service level with moderate holding risk given low current on-hand and no in-transit inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 15: demands = [70,72,78,52,60,58] (Periods 15\u201320). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N over the 6-period high-demand regime to capture the elevated mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand remains in the higher regime starting Period 15 (periods 15\u201321 demands: 70,72,78,52,60,58,47; mean\u224862.43). On-hand=27, in-transit=0 so current cover is low vs. recent demand; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised (confirmed) 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-Period-15 higher-demand regime (regime length=7), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 \u2192 no upcoming arrivals; recent demand regime (confirmed Period 15) is higher (~73 avg). Use promised lead time (0) since lead time was confirmed as 0 in history. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 15\u201322 constitute the high-demand regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples, and sigma_hat use recent_N N=8 to capture current volatility. This keeps service high for the sustained elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2192P23). Demand increased at Period 15 and has remained elevated: Periods 15\u201323 demands = [70,72,78,52,60,58,47,63,85], recent avg \u2248 60.8. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (regime from Period 15\u201323, length=9) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the 9 most recent high-demand samples. This emphasizes the sustained higher demand while limiting holdover from older low-demand periods and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P24 all arrived with lead time 0) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 15 (earlier carry-over insight). Current on-hand=1, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), respectively; this leverages the full historical demand while keeping parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and avoiding overreacting to recent spikes given a single SKU and material holding cost tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; demand shifted up at Period 15 (sustained higher mean since P15). I therefore keep L at promised/default (0). For demand I target the post-change regime: use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 15\u201325) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand data. This raises base_stock to reflect the sustained demand increase while sigma recent_N captures current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 15 (avg \u224873 over Periods 15\u201326) vs ~35 earlier; on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime length Periods 15\u201326 = 12) so mu_hat reflects the post-change mean over the last 12 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime while respecting the 0 lead time and avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has moderated after the mid-May jump: last 7 demands (Periods 21\u201327) = [47,63,85,75,47,34,36], mean \u224855.3. On-hand=39, in-transit=0 (no incoming). Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To respond quickly to recent regime and avoid overstock, forecast using recent 7-week mean across (1+L) review+lead period: mu_hat recent_N N=7; use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (q=0.8) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand elevated since Period 15 (confirmed earlier): latest 14 periods (P15\u2013P28) show higher, variable weekly demand vs pre-Period15. On-hand=12, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current+L periods. Lead time historically confirmed 0 \u2014 use promised (default). Use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint regime (uses most recent 14 samples P15\u2013P28) so OR base-stock and cap reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201329); demand regime shift at P15 doubled avg demand to ~73 (P15\u201317). Recent demand has moderated vs peak; last 5 demands = [47,34,36,60,70] (mean ~49.4). To be responsive to the recent pattern while retaining backend's lead-time assumption, set L=default (use promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand level ((1+L)*mean of last 5). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility and avoid overstock from earlier high-demand bursts. This keeps target base-stock tuned to recent demand while leveraging confirmed L=0 and avoiding large holding costs given low on-hand inventory and limited pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Recent demand regime (Periods 15\u201330) is materially higher than earlier periods (post-Period 15 avg ~73 vs ~35 prior). On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so we are exposed to stockouts if we under-forecast. Lead time history consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set L=default (promised 0), use recent_N for mu_hat to base the forecast on the last regime (N=16 covers Periods 15\u201330), and use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the base-stock on the higher recent mean while keeping variability aligned to the same window to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P31 all arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning Period 15 (Periods 15\u201331 average materially higher than Periods 1\u201314). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime length. Chosen methods: L=default to keep lead time=0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=17 (Periods 15\u201331) to base the (1+L)*mean on the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=17 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma_hat captures current variability so the OR cap moderates extreme orders.

Recent demand elevated since Period 15 (regime shift previously recorded) but that insight already captured. No overdue shipments. Use promised/default lead time so backend continues treating LT=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so baseline forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied; this balances service (using full history including the confirmed higher-demand regime) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (avg \u224835 before \u2192 \u224873.3 during Periods 15\u201317 and remaining elevated thereafter). To cover the (1+L) review+lead window while reflecting the higher recent demand, I keep L as default (promised 0) and set demand moments using recent data from the post-change regime. I choose recent_N with N=19 (Periods 15\u201333) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the sustained higher-demand regime, which balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Demand regime increased at Period 15 and has persisted through Period 34 (regime length = 20 periods: P15\u2013P34). To reflect the sustained higher demand while respecting the confirmed same-day arrivals, set L to promised (default=0), and estimate demand and volatility from the recent elevated regime using recent_N with N=20. This focuses the OR backend on the current higher mean/variance, improving service while keeping holding cost in check given immediate replenishment.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (avg ~73 since P15 vs ~35 before). To protect service in the higher-demand regime, use lead time default (promised 0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. Choose recent_N=20 (captures the most recent 20 weeks within the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the latest data; this raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while retaining volatility from recent observations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2014 keep promised/default lead time. Demand has been higher since Period 15; to capture recent level I use recent_N=7 (most recent 7 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for current demand regime while avoiding overstock. This balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by using recent demand estimates rather than long-run average.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (Periods 1\u201337), so keep promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows elevated and volatile weekly demand (Periods 33, 37 high: 79, 93) vs earlier regime shift at Period 15. To react quickly to recent higher demand while limiting exposure, I use a short recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base stock and cap adapt to the latest weeks without overfitting older low-demand weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (multiple confirmations through Period 38). Demand regime increased around Period 15 (mean roughly doubled then) and recent weeks remain variable but at an elevated level versus early periods. To keep service while controlling holding cost I use promised lead time (default) and bias demand estimates toward recent data to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using a moderately long recent window to smooth week-to-week noise while reflecting the post-changepoint regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals in concludes) and a sustained demand regime shift at Period 15 (avg rose ~+109%). On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so we have little pipeline coverage for upcoming demand. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) given consistent observed arrivals. For demand I bias toward recent data to capture the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N N=20 for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 20 samples (captures current higher-demand regime and recent seasonality). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance periods. These choices give the OR backend up-to-date mean/variance for the base-stock calculation and avoid understocking from older low-demand periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (Period 15). Current demand since mid-year is higher and more variable than the very early samples, so I bias estimates to recent history. I set L=default (promised 0) because concludes confirm 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (last 20 demand samples) to capture the post-changepoint mean and volatility and avoid dilution from the low-demand early-season weeks. This keeps the base-stock responsive to higher recent demand while the OR engine will cap orders via its cap formula, balancing service level (higher q from profit/holding) against holding cost. No overdue shipments to account for (arrived in previous periods match orders).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 15 but recent weeks (P37\u2013P41 demands = 93,69,54,32,32) average ~56. Lead time evidence (many concluded arrivals with W=0) supports promised L=0. To balance service vs holding cost, I use a recent-demand estimate (captures current volatility and recent mean) so orders respond to current demand without overstocking.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (Periods 1\u201342 arrivals all same-period). Recent demand shows no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded increase around Period 15. With no overdue/lost shipments and no clear new demand shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute base stock and variability. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively entering December (no confirmed holiday spike).

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained demand regime shift around Period 15 (higher mean since). Profit/holding ratio implies a high service target; use conservative defaults so backend uses full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) and std. Using default L keeps promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let OR engine compute base-stock from all historical samples.

Demand history shows past regime variation but no new sustained shift since prior insights. Use L default (promised lead time=0) to reflect confirmed fast replenishment. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, letting the base-stock formula and caps balance the high profit (profit=4, hold=1) against holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 heading into the pre-Christmas week; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 15 (avg ~73 since then vs ~35 prior). To keep service through this high-demand regime and near-term seasonal risk, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 20 samples to capture current mean/variance without overreacting to single-week spikes). This balances higher service level (captures elevated mean) versus holding cost by limiting N to 20 rather than all history.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346): [32,58,24,39,74,60], mean\u224847.8 \u2014 higher and more variable than early-year baseline; no new sustained changepoint since Period 15. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest 6-week demand profile so the OR backend sets a base-stock aligned to current elevated demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.
