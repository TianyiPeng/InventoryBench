  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows arrivals same period for all past orders (Lead time = 0 confirmed). Inventory & demand: on-hand=10, in-transit=0, recent demand remains elevated/variable (Periods 45\u201346 sold 44 and 60; several prior weeks sold in 50\u201375 range). OR recommended 57 units based on its base-stock/cap logic using promised L=0; with L actually 0 the OR assumptions align with reality. Holding cost is moderate ($1) vs profit $4, giving a high critical fractile (\u22480.8) so stocking to meet expected demand + safety stock is appropriate. Decision: follow OR recommendation and order 57 units to restore on-hand to approximately the recommended base-stock level (arrives same period). This balances avoiding stockouts during continued elevated demand while holding limited extra inventory.",
