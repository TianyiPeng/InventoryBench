Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand shows declining values (256,241,112,112,81) with overall mean ~160. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to meet upcoming demand. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline base-stock that balances profit (4) vs holding (1) via the OR formula. This is conservative given limited evidence of a sustained regime change and no shipment delays observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Recent conclude shows Period1 order (230) arrived in Period1 \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Historical weekly demand samples available (early 2019). Profit/holding ratio implies high service (q=0.8). No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time and default demand estimators (use all samples) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order ordered on Period1 arrived on Period1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent sales: Period1=82, Period2=102; historical sample mean=160.4 (samples:256,241,112,112,81). On-hand=113, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been observed as 0 but this is already recorded previously. Demand has shown lower recent weeks but evidence is not yet a sustained 3+ period regime shift, so use population estimates to avoid overfitting to short noise. Choose L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples, sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility. These settings balance service level (use full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given modest on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=115, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=160.4 (samples:256,241,112,112,81). Last 3 concluded periods show demands 82,102,89 (mean=91.0), indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs historical. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the recent lower demand (covers current review+lead period). This reduces holding cost while maintaining service given observed reduced demand and zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical avg=160.4 vs recent (Periods 1-3 concluded) avg=91.0 (-43%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P3 arrived same period). Recent demand has softened vs older history (recent 4 demands = 82,102,89,66; avg \u224884.75). To match current low-demand regime and the confirmed 0 lead time, use promised lead time (default) so ordering treats arrivals as same-period. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=4) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, reducing target base-stock to reflect the lower recent demand. Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend scale variability using all samples but with L=default, balancing service level vs. holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 (consistent across multiple periods). Recent demand has been lower and stable for the last 3 concluded periods (demands: 89, 66, 52 \u2192 recent mean ~69), so I use a recent_N=3 estimate for demand and volatility to capture the new regime. Using L=default (promised=0) keeps review+lead horizon minimal; mu_hat recent_N=3 targets (1+L)*recent mean to avoid overstock given holding cost; sigma_hat recent_N=3 captures current volatility for service-level calculation.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has declined and stabilized since Period 4: Periods 4-6 demands = 66, 52, 48 (avg 55.3) vs earlier historical avg ~160. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low but matches the lower recent demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (orders in P1,P2,P3,P5 arrived same period). I set L to "calculate" to lock in the confirmed observed lead time (average of observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 4-6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect reduced variability. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap order size, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized demand has fallen vs historical (recent 3 demands = 52, 48, 83, avg ~61) and lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Choose L=default to trust promised 0 (supported by repeated 0-period arrivals). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand regime and avoid overstock. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility and keep safety buffer aligned with current variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (periods 4-8: 66,52,48,83,90). Lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history. To target service while avoiding excess holding, use the promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent low-demand regime (last 5 concluded periods). Chosen recent_N=5 captures the current regime length (5 periods) and yields a tighter mean and std for the OR backend to compute a lower base stock and cap, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed repeatedly). Recent demand (Periods 4-9) has been lower and more variable than early history. To be responsive to the recent lower demand while capturing current volatility, I keep L as promised (default lead time = 0) and estimate demand using the last 6 concluded periods (Periods 4-9) for both mean and std; this reduces overstating required pipeline and limits holding cost while preserving service against recent variability.

Recent regime change detected at Period 4 (sustained lower demand afterward). Lead time observed consistently 0 in concluded history, so set L by calculating observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime: last 6 concluded demands (P5\u2013P10) reflect current lower demand; using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat gives the OR engine a forecast tuned to recent lower mean/variance and avoids overstock given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 9-11) = [60,29,28], recent mean=39.0 which is a clear drop versus prior recent regime. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed consistent 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to let the OR engine target the current lower demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so the backend models volatility from the same recent window. This reduces order targets to avoid excess holding cost given sustained lower demand while preserving service given current demand evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg decreased from 91.0 to 39.0 (-57%), based on Periods 9-11 demands [60,29,28] (sustained 3 periods).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=19, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Historical concluded lead times all 0. Demand has settled into a lower regime starting Period 9 (Periods 9-12 demands = 60,29,28,36; recent avg ~38). To avoid overstock while preserving service, I use observed lead time average and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. L chosen to reflect observed lead time=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 (regime length=4) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing recommended orders versus long-run historical averages and balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has settled low after earlier declines: Periods 9-13 demands = [60,29,28,36,23], recent_avg=35.2. On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so inventory is slightly below a (1+L)-period forecast. Historical mean (160.4) is obsolete given sustained low demand since Period 9. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on the most recent 5 periods (captures the confirmed low regime), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine toward lower replenishment consistent with the new low-demand regime while accounting for recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed Periods 1-14). Demand has been in a low regime for the last 3 concluded periods (P12-P14 demands = 36,23,28; recent mean=29.0). To keep orders aligned with the recent low demand and avoid holding costs, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 3-period regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to the sustained low demand and reduced variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled lower: Periods 9-15 demands = [60,29,28,36,23,28,30], recent average \u2248 33; last 7-period avg \u2248 33. No overdue shipments (lead time historically 0). To be responsive to the observed downward demand regime while accounting for one-period review+lead (1+L) the forecast uses recent data. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-changepoint lower mean/volatility, limiting exposure to holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes (P1,P2,...P16) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (sustained low demand across Periods 9-16; recent mean ~26-36). To reflect the sustained lower regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (capture last 8 periods since the changepoint at P9). Keeping L as default (promised=0) is justified by many confirms of 0 lead time. Using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current low-demand regime, reducing overstock while the backend's service-level q=0.8 is preserved via its z* calculation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead time=0 (sustained). Recent demand has declined: Periods 15-17 demands = [30,19,26], recent average = 25 units (3 periods). To reflect the confirmed short lead time and the recent lower-demand regime, set L to promised (default), forecast demand using the last 3 periods (recent_N N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean, and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to capture current volatility. This reduces ordering to avoid excess holding while maintaining service given very short lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history shows consistent zero actual lead time (all concluded arrivals report lead_time=0). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this period. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (Periods 9-18 recent demands ~60,29,28,36,23,28,28,30,19,26,27) \u2014 changepoint at Period 9 with a sustained lower mean. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (the recent low-demand regime length from Period 9\u201318) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing risk of overstock while maintaining service for the confirmed lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has settled materially below historical levels (last several periods ~20-30 units). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and recent lower-demand regime, set L based on observed lead times and forecast demand/volatility using recent samples (capturing the current low-demand regime). Using recent_N with N=6 (last 6 concluded demand periods) biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to current demand while L is computed from observed lead times so OR backend orders to match same-period replenishment and avoid excess holding costs.

Historical concluded lead time = 0 consistently. To avoid overstock given $1 holding vs $4 profit, use recent data to size the review+lead demand forecast and volatility. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to the lower recent regime and reduce excess inventory while preserving service level.

Recent demand has been low and appears to form a new low regime over the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 20-22 demands = [8,13,17]). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set lead time to default (promised 0) and forecast using the recent 3-period regime for mean and volatility (N=3). This keeps base-stock aligned with the current lower demand level and reduces overordering given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (all arrivals in concluded messages have lead_time 0). On-hand=2, in-transit=0, so inventory is very low vs recent weekly demands (~20-60 historically, recently lower). To let the OR backend use full historical stats and promised lead time, I select defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using all samples and promised L. This balances service (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given low on-hand and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime: last 12 concluded weekly demands = [23,28,30,19,26,27,31,8,13,17,15,10], mean \u224820.6. On-hand=106, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times have consistently been 0 periods. To align supply to the recent lower demand and limit holding cost, set L by calculating observed lead times, use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 12 weeks to capture the new regime, and match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This keeps base-stock and cap responsive to the sustained drop in demand while avoiding excess stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Period X arrived in Period X), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been lower than early historical samples (sustained decline previously recorded in carry-over notes), but no new sustained changepoint in the last concluded periods. Use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level given steady confirmed LT=0 and avoids overreacting to short recent fluctuations.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 9 (periods 9-26 demands avg ~23 units/week). On-hand=90, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so use default L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 18 concluded demand periods (captures Periods 9-26) so the base-stock targets scale to current demand. Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend compute volatility from full history (stable estimate). This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use observed average. Recent demand noisy with a one-off jump in Period 27 (69) but no sustained new regime; prefer an EWMA to emphasize recent weeks while damping the spike. Chosen: L via calculate to lock in observed lead time=0; mu_hat via EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) to adapt to recent lower demand while limiting reaction to the P27 spike; sigma_hat default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings keep target base-stock moderate to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4, while preserving service for typical recent demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show recent volatile behavior: last 5 concluded period demands = [10,17,22,69,167] (Period 24-28) with a large one-period spike at Period 28 (167) but not yet a sustained new regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost I keep L at promised (default 0), use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (N=5) to capture very recent demand mix (diluting the single spike), and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This provides a responsive mean forecast while properly inflating uncertainty for the OR backend cap calculation.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 28-29) show two large demand spikes (167,189) causing stockouts, but this is not yet a sustained regime change (only 2 periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overreacting to a short spike and because lead time is stable, I use default lead time and default demand stats (all historical samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock using the full sample mean/variance, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand shows a sharp, sustained spike in late Aug\u2013early Sep (Periods 28-30 demands = [167,189,176]). Lead times have been consistently 0 in all concluded periods, so use observed-average lead time. To react quickly to the recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 concluded demand samples (Periods 28-30) so the OR backend targets a much higher base-stock reflecting current demand; this balances service (avoid stockouts given zero pipeline) vs holding cost by relying on short observed lead time and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: avg increased to 177.33 (Periods 28-30 demands [167,189,176]) from prior avg 39.0 (+354%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to the observed average (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new high-demand regime (captures P28-31). This raises target base-stock to improve service in the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability; using recent data balances service level against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=23, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To target the current high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the 5-period high-demand run). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend size base stock to cover the elevated mean and recent variability while keeping holding costs grounded in current regime.

Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 28 (demands P28-P33 = [167,189,176,141,163,234]); recent regime length = 6. To capture the elevated mean and recent volatility I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)*mean on the last 6 samples, and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent variability. These parameters steer the OR engine toward higher base-stock levels appropriate for the sustained demand spike while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed Period1 arrival), so keep promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 28 (Periods 28-30 avg=177.33) and elevated demand has continued through Period 34. I set L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 28-34, regime_length=7; N = max(min(7,20),3)=7). This focuses the forecast and volatility on the current regime so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while capping orders via its cap to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=125, in-transit=0 \u2192 no imminent arrivals; inventory is sufficient for near-term demand but holding cost applies. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period), so set L via observed data. Demand regime increased starting Period 28 (carry-over insight): recent high demand persists (Periods 28-35 demands: 167,189,176,141,163,234,117,76; regime length=8). To capture current higher mean and volatility, use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and uncertainty using the most recent regime. These parameters will raise the base-stock to satisfy elevated demand while accounting for holding cost via the backend's service-level calculation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand regime increased around Periods 28-31 with higher, volatile weekly sales through Period 36; on-hand=136, in-transit=0 and observed lead time consistently 0. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0 (uses historical observed lead times). Demand forecasting uses a recent-window to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use last 9 weeks to include Periods 28\u201336 activity) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9. This keeps target base-stock sensitive to the elevated recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many periods), and recent demand regime increased starting Period 28 (Periods 28-37 recent demands = [167,189,176,141,163,234,117,76,62,76], regime length=10). No missing shipments. I set L=default to use promised 0 (confirmed by history). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-Period-28 high-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods, and rely on confirmed lead-time=0 so no extra pipeline buffer is added.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has come down from the late-summer peak; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 31-38) = [141,163,234,117,76,62,76,102], reflecting the current post-peak regime. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, I set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current demand level rather than the long-run peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No evidence of lost shipments or new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded shifts. I select L='calculate' to use the observed lead-time data (confirmed 0), and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set\u2014this avoids overreacting to recent noise/spikes and leverages all historical data for a stable base-stock recommendation given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demands fluctuate (Periods 38-40: 102, 43, 42) with no new sustained 3+ period regime shift. No overdue or lost shipments visible. To avoid overfitting short-term noise and rely on full historical signal, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock from all samples. This balances service level (using long-run mean/variance) against holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Recent demand has fallen from the late-summer peak; last 3 concluded weekly demands = [43,42,59], avg \u224848. To respond to the recent lower regime and limit holding cost while preserving service, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 ((1+L)*recent mean).

Recent single-period demand spike at Period 42 (demand=182) is NOT yet a sustained regime change (only one high demand week and a stockout). No overdue/lost shipments observed. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (observed 0). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to use the full-sample mean/variance (conservative given no confirmed sustained new regime). These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service level (using full history) versus holding cost without overreacting to a one-period spike.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Lead time has consistently been 0 in all concluded periods; keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows elevated/variable levels (Periods 41-43 demands = 59, 182, 98) indicating a short recent regime with mean ~113; use recent 3-sample estimate to capture current elevated demand and volatility. On-hand=38, in-transit=0 so ordering should target the short-term recent demand pattern to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated demand vs earlier low-regime: last 5 concluded demands = [42,59,182,98,154] (mean=107), with a sharp spike Week 42 (182) but sustained elevated sales in Weeks 43-44. No evidence of lead-time slips (historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0). To balance service vs holding cost during this higher-demand phase, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock to reflect the current higher mean/volatility while limiting excess inventory given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Recent concluded demands (Periods 43-45) = [98,154,133] (avg=128.3) after prior high variability; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. No new multi-period regime change since prior carry-overs. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent demand level (captures current post-peak December demand). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters keep replenishment responsive to the current demand regime while avoiding excess holding given limited on-hand and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Dec) have shown elevated demand but historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (every concluded order arrived same period). No clear new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded shifts. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed stable at 0). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses all historical samples for (1+L)-period demand and volatility; this keeps the baseline base-stock appropriate while the backend cap limits single-period order size. This balances the high service-level target (profit/holding -> q=0.8) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.
