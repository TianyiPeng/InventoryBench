Demand history (weekly): 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:14, 01-28:47, 02-04:29, current period 02-11 observed demand 47. Recent 4-period average (14,47,29,47) = 34.25 units; median ~38. There is an upward/volatile recent regime vs. near-zero January. Promised lead time = 0 (supplier), but actual lead time is unconfirmed (no conclude history); orders could still be delayed/lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so to meet expected demand in the current period we must order now (if actual lead time = 0 it will arrive in-period; if not, we'll stockout). Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1/period. Optimizing expected reward favors meeting likely demand while avoiding large overstock. I target roughly the recent average rounded up to provide modest safety stock: order 40 units. This balances service (avoids lost profit of $4/unit) vs. holding cost ($1/unit) if unsold.",
