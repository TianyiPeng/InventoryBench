======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 5: orders have arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. Demand analysis: recent periods (P40\u2013P46) demands = [14,7,19,9,7,14,18], mean \u224813.4/week; seasonal end-of-year pattern shows subdued demand vs. mid-year spikes. OR recommended 85 but OR uses long-run history including high summer months and promised lead time; with profit=holding cost the critical fractile is 0.5 so safety stock is minimal when LT=0. With LT=0 we only need to cover the current period demand (L+1=1). I therefore order slightly above recent mean to allow modest upside but avoid heavy holding cost. Final action: order 15 units.",
