Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual LT. Treat LT as uncertain, assume same-period or short but do not rely on arrivals this period. d) Inventory & pipeline: Zero coverage now; current period demand will occur after this decision, so we must order to cover expected demand for the immediate period. Holding cost is low ($1/unit) relative to profit ($19/unit), so moderate safety stock is acceptable. e) Final order logic: Order roughly one-week expected demand (~55) rounded slightly up to provide minimal safety stock given demand volatility. This balances service (capture profitable sales) vs. holding cost.",
