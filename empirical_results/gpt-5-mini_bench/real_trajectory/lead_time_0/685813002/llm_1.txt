Holding cost is low ($1) vs profit ($19) so stocking to meet expected demand maximizes expected reward. Because actual lead time is unknown, I choose to place an order equal to the forecast (50 units) to satisfy expected demand if shipments arrive this period; avoid excessive overstock given uncertainty.",
