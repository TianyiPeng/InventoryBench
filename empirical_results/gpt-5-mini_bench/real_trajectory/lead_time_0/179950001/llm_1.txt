Product is non-perishable fashion accessory; demand is discretionary. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly demand samples show a clear downward trend over 5 weeks: 2019-01-07:105, 2019-01-14:62, 2019-01-21:72, 2019-01-28:48, 2019-02-04:36. The most recent weeks are low (48 -> 36). c) Lead time / missing orders: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: With no inventory or pipeline and uncertain lead time, we must balance service vs. holding cost. Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period, so excess ending inventory is very costly relative to profit. e) Final order logic: Forecast current-period demand ~36 (based on most recent observation). Given high holding cost equal to margin, order conservatively to cover ~current expected demand only and avoid excess inventory. Therefore order 36 units.",

Demand observations are censored by stockouts: Period1 true demand=40 (sold 36 due to starting stock), Period2 true demand=87 but sold only 40 (stockout).
