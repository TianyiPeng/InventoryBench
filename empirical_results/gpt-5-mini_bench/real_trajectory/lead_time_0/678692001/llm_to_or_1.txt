Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 194 units/week and std ~43. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence suggesting deviations from promised lead time. Profit/holding ratio (4/(4+1)=0.8) implies a high service target; therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from all samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Historical weekly demand samples (270,196,180,187,137) give mean=194 and std\u224843. On-hand=151, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Profit/holding ratio q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 high service target. Use default lead time (promised=0, historically observed 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (mu_hat=194, sigma_hat\u224843) balancing service level vs holding cost given ample on-hand stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived with lead_time=0 (two confirmations). On-hand=108, in-transit=0. Demand samples provided (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) reflect higher historical mean (~194), but the last two concluded periods show lower weekly sales (84,121). However this drop is only 2 periods (insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift). No shipments appear overdue. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to a short two-period downturn.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed concluded demands (Periods 1-3): 84, 121, 108 \u2014 well below earlier historical samples (Jan 7\u2013Feb 4 mean 194). On-hand=111, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are all 0, so use calculated lead time. I detect a sustained downward demand regime over the last 3 periods; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new lower mean and volatility. These parameters downweight older high-Jan demand and help the OR backend reduce excess inventory while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: periods 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25 (Periods 1\u20133) recent mean=104.33 vs prior historical mean=194.0 (\u221246%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 1-3 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25) show mean=104.33 vs historical mean=194. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods. Observed concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use calculate to capture observed average lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (3 most recent demand observations: 84,121,108/136? recent regime defined on 3 periods) so OR base-stock and cap are computed from the reduced mean and volatility, avoiding overstock while maintaining service. This balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) under the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20135). Recent demand has risen from the low regime ( Periods 1\u20133 mean=104.33 ) to higher values in Periods 3\u20135 (108,136,142) suggesting a new short-run mean. To adapt quickly while respecting observed lead time, set L via calculate (observed average lead_time=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (most recent 3 periods: 108,136,142) so the base-stock targets reflect current elevated demand and control holding cost given limited on-hand/in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20136) shows a sustained higher regime: demands = [136,142,128], avg \u2248 135.33, up from the prior recent mean \u2248104.33 recorded earlier. On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. I set L=default because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (no evidence to change). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new 3-period higher-demand regime (will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters make the OR backend raise the base stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping estimates focused on the newest regime to limit excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: periods 2019-03-04 to 2019-03-18 (Periods 4\u20136) recent mean=135.33 vs prior recent mean=104.33 (+29.8%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: 142,128,145) indicates elevated demand vs earlier regime; to prioritize service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) so mu_hat reflects current higher mean and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with all observed concludes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time = 0 each period (orders from P1\u2013P8 all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has shown regime shifts earlier (noted in carry-over) but the most recent two periods (P7\u2013P8) are not yet a sustained new regime (only 2 periods). No overdue or lost shipments to account for. To avoid overfitting short blips and let the OR engine use the full sample base, I select default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat use all historical samples scaled by (1+L), balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20139) show orders always arrived same period (lead_time=0 each), so I infer lead time = 0. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: Periods 7\u20139 demands = 145, 148, 80) is volatile; to reflect the most current regime and because profit/holding (4/1) implies a high service target, I set demand forecast using the most recent 3 observations so the OR backend raises base-stock toward recent demand while sigma captures recent variability. Methods: L from observed lead times (calculate); mu_hat recent_N with N=3; sigma_hat recent_N with N=3.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 8\u201310 = 148,80,60) shows a drop to mean=96 over last 3 periods vs prior regime mean=135.33 (\u221228.9%), sustained for 3 periods. No overdue shipments detected; lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. To react quickly to the confirmed downturn, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new lower short-run demand (1+L times recent mean = 96). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock and limit excess holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: periods 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-15 (Periods 8\u201310) recent mean=96.0 vs prior recent mean=135.33 (\u221228.9%), sustained 3 periods

Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded demands show a lower regime in the most recent 3 periods (Periods 9\u201311 demands = 80, 60, 71; recent mean \u2248 70.33). On-hand=64, in-transit=0; all concluded arrivals show observed lead time = 0 historically. I set L by calculating observed lead times (consistent zeros). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the latest downward regime and avoid overstock; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap inventory while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Recent demand has fallen from earlier highs; last 3 concluded demand samples (Periods 10-12) are 60, 71, 83 \u2014 a lower-demand regime. I keep L as default (promised 0) since observed lead time remains 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given holding cost > 0. No new multi-period sustained pattern beyond previously recorded shifts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since early April (Periods 8\u201313: demands = 146,80,60,71,83,96) with a recent average \u224889; I use the last 6 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime while retaining some smoothing. Choose L=default to trust promised 0-period lead time (no lost shipments observed). Use mu_hat recent_N N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over last 6 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture current volatility. This balances service (reflecting lower recent demand) against holding cost given zero on-hand and zero pipeline.

Recent demand has settled lower: Periods 13-15 demands = [96, 92, 75], indicating a reduced regime (3-period mean \u2248 87.7). To keep service while limiting holding cost, set L based on observed lead times and base stock demand using the most recent 3 periods to capture the current lower demand regime and reduced volatility.

Recent demand (Periods 12\u201316 = 83,96,92,75,83) shows a lower recent mean vs earlier regimes; I use recent 5 periods to capture current demand level while keeping responsiveness.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period; recent demand shows uptick (last 3 sold: 75,83,93? actually sold: Periods 15-17 sold=75,83,93 but demand samples used for forecasting are 75,83,109) \u2014 using the last 3 periods to capture this higher recent demand while keeping lead time at observed average. I select L by calculation of observed lead times (will be 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent regime and increased variance, so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover the short-term demand increase without overcommitting inventory given holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders ordered in same period arrived same period). On-hand=12, in-transit=0; recent demand appears moderate with no new sustained shift since prior recorded regime changes. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because observed lead times are stable. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent six weeks (Periods 13\u201318) which reflect current demand level (~92 units/week) and reduce influence of older regime swings. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep base stock tied to current observed mean/volatility, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost and avoiding overstock given no in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 17\u201319) = [109, 92, 128], indicating a short-run mean \u2248109.7 which is below long-run historical mean due to earlier regime shifts. On-hand and in-transit = 0, so orders must cover current-period demand. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the most recent regime (N=3 chosen because the last 3 periods reflect the current demand level). This keeps base-stock aligned with current lower volatility and demand to reduce holding costs while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible in concluded history (all past orders showed lead_time=0). Recent demand (Periods 16\u201320 = 83,109,92,128,71) shows moderate volatility and a recent mean below earlier highs; no new sustained regime change detected. Use promised/default lead time (0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (most relevant 5 weeks: Periods 16\u201320) so mu_hat reflects current lower mean; match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and avoid overstock.

Recent demand has fallen versus earlier periods; last 3 demands (Periods 19-21) = [128, 71, 42], recent mean \u2248 80.33. To be responsive to the current low-demand regime while keeping service, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the latest regime and reduce overstock risk. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce forecast bias from older higher-demand periods and help the OR backend lower base-stock and cap, trading off service level for lower holding cost given observed decline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has collapsed over the last 3 weeks (Periods 20\u201322: 71, 42, 25). Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock small to avoid excess holding given the pronounced, sustained drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: periods 2019-06-24 to 2019-07-08 (Periods 20\u201322) recent mean=46.0 vs prior recent mean=109.67 (\u221258%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has been in a low regime (Periods 21-23 demands = 42, 25, 36; recent mean=34.33) consistent with previously recorded regime shift (Period 23 insight). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost in this low-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 3 weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been low: Periods 22-24 demands = [25,36,29], recent mean \u224830 units (sustained 3 periods). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 (no evidence of delays). To match the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so the base stock reflects the most recent low-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been low and stable: last 3 concluded demands = 36, 29, 21 (mean ~28.7), on-hand=14, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (no evidence of persistent lead-time increase). To avoid excess holding given Profit=$4 / Holding=$1, I bias forecasting to the recent low regime using recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-demand run; L left as default (promised). This keeps base-stock and cap small to limit holding cost while covering the immediate (L+1) periods of expected demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 23\u201326 demands = [36,29,21,12], mean 24.5 (4 periods) vs prior regime mean 46.0 (Periods 20\u201322). All historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so promised lead time remains credible. On-hand=23, in-transit=0, so available stock covers roughly one recent-week demand (\u224824.5). To avoid overstock given $1 holding cost and $4 profit, I bias forecasts to the new low regime by using recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (captures the sustained drop). Keep L default (promised 0) because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time and no missing shipments. This reduces order targets to match the lower demand regime and limit holding costs while preserving service for expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: periods 2019-07-15 to 2019-08-05 (Periods 23\u201326) recent mean=24.5 vs prior recent mean=46.0 (\u221246.7%), sustained 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been in a low summer regime since Period 23 (demands: P23\u2013P27 = 36,29,21,12,18; recent mean \u2248 23.2 over 5 periods). All concluded orders historically show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; given low recent demand and confirmed zero lead time, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (captures the 5-period regime length and avoids inflating forecast with older high-demand periods). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to current low demand, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service given same-period replenishment.

Recent demand has fallen sharply; last 3 concluded demands = 12, 18, 8 (mean=12.67), matching the multi-period downward regime documented in carry-over. All observed lead times have been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost > unit profit ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: last 7 periods (P23\u2013P29) demands = [36,29,21,12,18,8,9], mean=19.0, well below historical mean (~194) and matching the previously recorded low-demand regime. All concluded lead-time observations remain 0. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed=0 consistently). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (captures the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding costs). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize lower base stock to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since mid-June (carry-over notes): most recent 4 weeks demand = [18,8,9,6] (avg ~10.25). On-hand=22, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. I keep L='default' (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence of persistent shipment loss. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest low-demand regime while smoothing a bit beyond the very last 4 points; N=8 captures the recent downward shift without overreacting to the last single-week noise. This reduces target base-stock and cap, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current low demand environment.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has collapsed: last 4 weeks (Periods 28\u201331) demands = [8,9,6,2], mean=6.25 \u2014 far below earlier regimes. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; with promised lead time=0 and historically observed lead time=0, no delayed shipments. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new low-demand regime (N equals the 4-period recent regime length). This reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: periods 2019-08-19 to 2019-09-09 (Periods 28\u201331) recent mean=6.25 vs prior recent mean=24.5 (\u221274.5%), sustained 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent demand has settled at a low regime (most recent 4-week regime mean \u22486.25) and concluded lead times have been consistently 0. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory already covers several weeks at current demand. I use L=default to trust promised lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and lowers holding costs while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been at a low regime since Period 28 (2019-08-19) with values [8,9,6,2,2,5] (Periods 28\u201333) \u2014 sustained low demand confirmed by prior carry-over. Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to target the most recent low-demand regime (regime length=6), giving the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean from last 6 samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 so variability reflects the recent regime. This keeps orders small to limit holding cost while matching the confirmed low demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since late Aug/Sept (carry-over records a shift at Period 31 to very low weekly demand). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded orders show 0), so keep L as default. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates focusing on the most recent 3 weeks (N=3) to capture the current low mean and reduced volatility; this keeps orders small and limits holding cost while maintaining service. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current low variability.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled very low (last 5 periods: 6,2,2,5,3,0 with periods 31\u201335 showing 2,2,5,3,0). No overdue shipments observed; historical arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (most recent stable window) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service on the current low demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: periods 2019-09-09 to 2019-10-07 (Periods 31\u201335) recent mean=2.4 vs prior recent mean=6.25 (\u221261.6%), sustained 5 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since late Aug/Sep (recent demands: P32-36 = 2,5,3,0,6; recent mean ~3.2). To avoid excess holding while meeting low current demand, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the low-demand regime. Sigma set from the same recent 5 to reflect current low volatility. These params keep base-stock tight to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the low recent demand level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a low regime since mid-Sep (carry-over records: sustained drops culminating in Period 35 change; last 7 weekly demands = [2,2,5,3,0,6,1], mean\u22482.71). No concluded evidence of lead-time lengthening (historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 repeatedly). To avoid excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1, use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand estimates from the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 weeks so the OR engine targets a small base-stock aligned with current low sales and variance while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; recent demand has been very low and stable (multiple sustained regime shifts documented through Period 36). Historical observed lead times have been 0. To avoid overstocking given Profit=4, Hold=1 and very low recent demand, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent low-demand regime. Chose recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest 5 observed demands and their volatility so the OR backend sets a low base-stock and caps order size.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has fallen sharply and remained low since the late-summer regime shifts (see carried insights). On-hand=4, in-transit=0; historical arrivals confirm promised lead time=0. I use the promised lead time (default). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to focus the forecast on the latest low-demand regime (capture last 5 weeks where demand has been ~2\u20136 units). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend sizes base-stock and safety stock to recent low mean and volatility, avoiding excess holding while preserving service for current low demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has fallen to a low, stable regime: last 7 observed weekly demands (Periods 34\u201340) = [3,0,6,1,6,2,3], mean \u2248 3. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so available coverage is ~1 week at current demand \u2014 low but matches recent regime. No evidence of lead-time increase (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically). Set L=default to use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand over (1+L) using the most recent low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service. This balances high profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1) by targeting a low base-stock aligned to current observed demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 32 (multiple periods with weekly demand ~0\u20136, recent 10-period mean ~2\u20133). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence of lost shipments, so use promised lead time (default). To align ordering with the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set demand forecast based on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 10 weeks of low demand). These parameters reduce target base stock and safety stock relative to long-run historical averages, balancing service vs holding cost given the persistent low-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0. Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 36 (weekly demands: P36\u2013P42 = 6,1,6,2,3,2,4; recent mean\u22482.75). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using recent data from the low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default (trusted promised lead time=0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent low-volatility observations. This reduces order quantities vs. long-run averages and limits holding cost given very low current demand.

Historical carry-over shows multiple downward regime shifts; current regime is low and sustained. Use promised lead time (default L=0).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=2, in-transit=0 (no arrivals expected). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded history shows actual lead_time=0, so use default L to keep model aligned with supplier. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand but maintain high service (profit $4 vs hold $1 \u2192 q=0.8), I forecast demand using recent data: mu_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect reduced volatility. These parameters keep target base-stock low and reduce holding cost while preserving service level for the current low-demand regime.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime (many weeks of single-digit demand since Period 35); to capture current low demand I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a much lower base stock and avoids excess holding while maintaining service for the small, recent demand.

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 36 (2019-10-14) with ~1\u20136 units/week recently; holding cost high relative to profit encourages lean stocking. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (periods 36\u201346, regime length 11) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect current low demand and reduced volatility, avoiding excess inventory given zero pipeline and small on-hand.
