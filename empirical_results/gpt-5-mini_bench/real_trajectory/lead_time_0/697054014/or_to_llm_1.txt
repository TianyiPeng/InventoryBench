{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed L=0 from carry-over (orders have arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand=36, in-transit=0 so any order placed will arrive in the same selling period. Recent demand: last 6 periods show elevated activity (P40\u2013P45 demands = 90,72,178,93,116,98) with a large spike (178 at P42) consistent with late-Nov/Dec holiday season (current date 2019-12-23). OR recommendation = 97 (uses historical avg and promised L). With L=0 we need to cover only current period demand after ordering, but holiday volatility suggests higher single-period demand risk than OR's baseline. Profit/holding gives critical fractile 0.8 (z\u22480.84) which OR applied; I adjust upward to guard against observed spikes while limiting holding cost. Target availability \u2248 150 units (covers worst recent spikes while tolerating some holding cost). With 36 on-hand, order = 150 \u2212 36 = 114; I round modestly up to 120 to be more conservative for holiday demand and potential forecast error. Final action: order 120 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 97\u2192120 units because lead time is 0 and recent demand shows a holiday spike (peak 178), so raise supply to cover elevated single-period demand while accepting moderate holding cost.",

Recent demand (P42\u2013P46): [178,93,116,98,93], mean \u2248115.6 but includes a large spike (178) likely an outlier. OR recommends 70 (uses full history and promised L=0).

To balance service and holding cost (profit=$4, hold=$1 \u2192 critical fractile 0.8) and given demand variability and a recent large spike, I trim OR's recommendation to avoid excess holding over the holiday week.
