Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (5): [97,69,105,87,104], mean=92.4, std\u224814.9. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time used (default). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine replenishes toward one week of expected demand (~92.4) while respecting its caps.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u224892.4 units/week (std \u224813.35). Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived in-period (ordered P1, arrived P1) so actual lead time is consistent with promised L=0. Current on-hand=17, in-transit=0 \u2014 well below expected single-period demand (~92), so we should target the default forecast based on full historical mean. Given profit=holding, q=0.5 so target safety z\u22480; using defaults keeps base_stock = mean demand and lets OR backend compute capped order respecting its cap and promised lead time. This balances service level vs holding cost under confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times: two observations both 0 -> no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand samples (Jan weekly): mean ~92.4; recent sales in Periods 1-2 show high demand (76, 129) but not a sustained new regime. Use calculated lead time (backend average of observed lead times = 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a baseline replenishment that balances the equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5) while not overreacting to only two weeks of elevated demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (concluded periods) show sales: P1=76, P2=90 sold (demand 129), P3=96 sold (demand 108); historical weekly samples (Jan) average ~92. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no overdue/unconcluded shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in the last 3 concludes. I choose L by calculate to confirm observed lead time=0. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time and no evidence of demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period1; Period2 order arrived Period2; Period3 order arrived Period3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Recent selling (Periods1-4) shows higher mean (76,129,108,92 -> avg 101.25) than older historical samples (avg ~92), and all concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. To react to the apparent upward demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the newer demand level while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P5) shows all orders arrived same period they were placed (lead_time=0). On-hand=20, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying q=0.5 (z*\u22480), so using population/default demand estimates is appropriate. I set L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time=0 from concluded arrivals, and use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this yields a base-stock consistent with historical demand and balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples mean \u224892.4 (samples: 97,69,105,87,104). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 periods. Profit and holding cost equal ($1), so target service z\u22480; use defaults so OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std with promised lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, confirmed actual lead time=0 from prior concludes. Recent demand has been variable with higher episodes (periods 2,3,7). To balance service vs holding cost I use lead time=default (promised 0, confirmed), and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime while limiting noise. sigma_hat also from recent 5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0), and recent demand history (Periods 1\u20138) shows stable weekly demand with no sustained regime shift. With profit=holding, service target ~50% (z\u22480); therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to compute base stock. This balances service vs. holding given no further evidence of change and no pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed) and on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Demand history across periods 1-9 shows variable weekly demand (range ~67\u2013129) with no sustained decline or spike; no new changepoint detected. Use promised lead time default to keep OR backend aligned with observed zero lead time. Use default demand mean/variance (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrival behavior. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed stable demand and zero lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent history (Periods 1\u201311) shows same-period arrivals consistently and variable weekly demand (several stockouts and some weeks with leftover inventory). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus lead time. Use default L (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms 0-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P12 all arrived same period). Recent demand appears slightly below earlier sample mean; last 5 concluded demands = [108,67,66,117,65] (mean \u224884.6). To reflect current demand regime and confirmed 0 lead time, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock using the most recent demand mean/variance and avoids overstock given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and volatile weekly demand with many weeks near ~90 and occasional spikes (most recent demand=179 is an outlier). I retain promised lead time=0 (use default) and use all-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to single spike: mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean(all samples) \u2248 92.4; sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 13.35. This balances service (using historical mean) against holding cost and avoids chasing the one large spike.

Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201316) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). Demand history shows variable weekly demand including recent large spikes (Periods 15\u201316: 179,182) but no sustained regime change of 3+ periods. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use default calculations so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) while avoiding overfitting to recent spikes that may be transient.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (all concluded orders from P1\u2013P17 arrived with lead_time=0) and volatile weekly demand with several large spikes (e.g., P15\u2013P17 demands 179,182,149). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to order for current-period demand. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each) and leverages full-sample estimates rather than short-window noise.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a clear demand increase beginning Period 15 (demands: P15=179, P16=182, P17=149, P18=116) vs prior typical ~80-100. I treat lead time as promised (default). For demand I use recent_N to capture the new higher regime (use last 4 periods covering the sustained spike) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility; this reduces stockouts while avoiding excessive holding cost by limiting history to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand (P1\u2013P14) \u2248 92 vs recent avg (P15\u2013P18) = 156 (+69%), sustained 4 periods (P15\u2013P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show a sustained demand regime shift from Period 15\u201318 (recent avg \u2248156 vs earlier \u224892). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime length=4). Keeping L=default (promised lead time=0) aligns with confirmed arrivals and avoids inflating pipeline. This raises the base-stock to cover the elevated (1+L)-period demand while recent_N sigma captures higher variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over insight Period 4). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 15 (P15\u2013P18 avg \u2248156 vs prior \u224892). To respect the confirmed lead time and recent higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates with N=4 to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 4 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). Use recent_N N=4 for volatility to reflect recent variability. These settings raise the base-stock to service the higher recent weekly demand while keeping holding exposure aligned with observed short lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand regime (Periods 15\u201321) is higher and sustained vs earlier periods; on-hand=24, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. To protect service while avoiding excess holdings, use L=default (promised=0) and set demand estimates using recent data from the new high-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=7 (Periods 15\u201321) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained uplift and recent volatility; this concentrates forecast on the current regime and lets the OR backend compute base_stock accordingly.

To reflect the recent higher demand I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the recent regime (Periods 15\u201322).

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201323), and a demand regime shift was observed starting Period 15 with sustained higher demand. I set L by calculation from observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 15\u201323) to capture the new higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the elevated mean and observed volatility while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0. To capture the recent post-spike demand regime while smoothing older data, I use mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (backing the base-stock around the recent local mean). With profit=holding, service quantile is 0.5 so z*=0 and base_stock \u2248 mu_hat; using sigma_hat=default lets the OR engine compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (cover recent demand) versus holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-high peaks seen in Periods 15\u201319; last 6 observed demands (P20\u2013P25) = [167,121,73,69,61,59] showing a lower recent mean. On-hand=40, in-transit=0 and promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (sustained evidence Periods 1\u201325). To adapt the forecast to the newest regime I use recent_N on both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, while keeping L=default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. This reduces over-ordering from older high-demand periods and balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

No new sustained changepoint since last insight. I select default lead time (use promised/confirmed 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, allowing the backend to incorporate the confirmed L=0 and observed higher recent demand into its base-stock calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201327). Demand shows a recent downshift since Period 22 (demands P22\u2013P27 = 73,69,61,59,76,46; recent average \u224864 over 6 weeks) vs earlier elevated regime. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed concluded arrivals. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to adapt the base-stock to the recent lower-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk versus using the long-run mean while preserving service given short lead time and matched profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show consistent lead time=0 and a past demand regime uplift (P15\u2013P18) but recent weeks (P24\u2013P28) show lower, more variable demand (last 5 demands: 61,59,76,46,98; mean\u224868.8). No new sustained changepoint detected. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (consistent concluded evidence). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand pattern and short-run volatility, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and current zero inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over). Recent demand volatile but last 5 periods (P25\u2013P29) average \u224879.8 units, reflecting current regime after earlier mid-year shift. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), use L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to current demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost parity with profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P30). Recent demand (last ~6 weeks) averages near historical overall mean and the earlier mid-May spike (P15\u2013P18) appears temporary. To avoid overreacting to the isolated spike and because lead time is stable, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples). This balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Date=2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period4 insight) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period15 (higher mean sustained). To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent regime; use the same recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Keep L as default (promised / confirmed 0). This raises base stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat based on recent data balances service level vs holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P32), and recent demand has moderated from the high mid-year spike; no sustained new changepoint since previous insights. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations and avoid overstock, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend calculates base_stock from full-sample mean/std (1+L review+lead coverage). This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I keep lead time at promised (0) because lead time was previously confirmed as 0. To reflect the recent lower demand regime I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent behavior and reduce overstock risk. This balances service (capture current weekly demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost= $1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 30\u201334 = 82,44,33,46,47) averages ~50 units \u2014 substantially lower than the mid-year spike (Periods 15\u201319). To align the base-stock horizon with very recent demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest low-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while meeting current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201335). Recent demand has reverted from the high regime (P15\u2013P18) to lower, more variable weekly sales (P28\u2013P35). No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected. Using promised lead time (default L=0) keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from full historical samples; this balances service level (captures past high-demand periods) against holding cost given current low pipeline (in-transit=0).

To adapt, set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by history). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent low-demand regime; this reduces excess holding while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand has fallen materially vs mid-year spike: Periods 31\u201337 demand = [44,33,46,47,36,30,44], recent avg \u2248 40 units. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). To avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand, set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=7 for demand estimates (captures the current low-demand regime of length 7). sigma_hat also set to recent_N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap ordering, balancing service level against holding cost given current low demand and on-hand=19, in-transit=0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent through Period 38). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-year spike (Periods 15\u201319) back to lower levels: last 4 concluded demands (P35\u2013P38) = [36,30,44,34], mean \u2248 36. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples) so the base stock targets lower recent demand rather than the long-run elevated mean. I keep sigma_hat as default so variability is estimated from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce excess holding cost given low on-hand/in-transit and recent low demand while maintaining service for the next period given lead time=0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period 39) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a lower regime since about Period 31 (post-peak): recent demands P31\u2013P39 = [44,33,46,47,36,30,44,34,29], regime length = 9. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concludes confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (captures the current low-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most relevant samples; this reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201340) has settled at a lower regime (demands: 44,33,46,47,36,30,44,34,29,37; mean \u224836) versus the earlier high regime from Period 15\u201318. On-hand=2, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for the current low-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. To match the current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (last 10 periods) so the backend bases base-stock and cap on the current lower mean and volatility, avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit. No evidence of lost shipments currently.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence P1\u2013P41). Recent demand shows variability but no NEW sustained regime change since previous insight. Using default lead time to trust supplier's same-period fulfillment. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost. This addresses zero on-hand/pipeline by allowing the OR engine to place same-period replenishment to cover current demand.

Historical concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier) and a past sustained demand regime shift (Periods 15\u201318) but recent weeks (P37\u2013P42) show moderate/low demand and no new sustained change. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments so the engine computes base-stock from all samples and balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through P43) confirm actual lead time=0 and no missing shipments recently. Recent demand (Periods 37\u201343) is a sustained low-demand regime (~30\u201360 units/week) following the mid-year spike; I therefore use a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower mean and reduced volatility. L uses default (promised = 0) consistent with confirmed lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to cover the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 37\u201343). This reduces overstock risk while providing service for near-term demand; it helps the OR backend lower target base_stock and cap to avoid excessive holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weeks (Periods 40\u201344 demands = 37,48,91,59,103) show elevated and volatile demand around late Nov\u2013early Dec (holiday season). Lead time historically confirmed 0. To respond quickly to recent demand while limiting holding cost, I use a short recent-window demand estimate (last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service on current regime while L stays at promised/default.

Recent demand has varied but no new sustained regime change since prior insight (demand uptick at P15\u2013P18 already recorded).

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand since Period 37 has been mixed (low-to-moderate with occasional spikes) but no new sustained regime change detected (needs 3+ periods of consistent shift). To let the OR engine use full historical sample statistics and the promised lead time, I select default methods: L uses promised lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat use all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service (uses full demand history) while avoiding overreacting to recent noisy weeks given no sustained shift; with on-hand=7 and no pipeline, this will prompt the backend to replenish toward the statistically indicated base stock.
