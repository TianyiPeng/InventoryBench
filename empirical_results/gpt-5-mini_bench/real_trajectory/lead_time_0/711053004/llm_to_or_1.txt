Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift across the five samples (6,13,32,49,62). No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet (on-hand=0,in-transit=0), so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. To capture the recent upward regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the full recent trend). Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability over (1+L). This balances higher target stock for the clear demand rise while keeping volatility estimation standard since sample size is small.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed 2019-01-07..2019-02-04: avg first 2 weeks = 9.5 -> avg last 3 weeks = 47.7 (+402%); treat as sustained recent upshift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history (Periods covering 2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows a sustained demand upshift: first 2 weeks avg=9.5 -> last 3 weeks avg=47.7 (+402%). Period 1 order arrived with observed lead_time=0 (ordered P1, arrived P1). I set L using calculate to confirm actual lead time from observed arrivals (will average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-regime mean across the last 3 samples (regime length=3). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect the recent regime's variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping lead-time estimation data-driven and guarding against lost shipments (none observed).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1 and P2 both arrived same period). Historical demand samples show a sustained upshift (carry-over noted): last 3 weeks avg \u224847.7 vs earlier low weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current high-demand regime. I therefore use promised/observed lead time (default) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent regime (recent_N=3) to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to favor service (high profit relative to holding cost) while keeping variability measured over the recent surge. No evidence of lost shipments to account for.

Daily Reward (R_t): $952.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand has clearly shifted up recently (high demands in Periods 1-3 and prior 5-sample trend). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (avg=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (uses Periods 1-3 concluded demand samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of most recent high-demand periods. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with the confirmed zero lead time and the sustained demand upshift while limiting excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand regime: historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a sustained upshift in the last 3 weeks (avg \u224847.7) vs earlier weeks; on-hand=54, in-transit=0, profit=19, holding=1. All concluded arrivals P1\u2013P4 show lead_time=0 consistently. I set L by observed history to lock in same-period delivery. For demand I use the most recent regime (last 3 high-demand weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect the elevated mean and recent variability; this raises base_stock to avoid stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3, P4 arrived P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained upshift vs early-Jan samples; recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5) = [38,73,52,30,37]. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the last 5 observed demands (captures the sustained higher regime). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while using current lead-time evidence; they also avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples. No missing shipments to address.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical sample and conclues show confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained demand upshift versus older 5-week samples; recent demand (last 5 periods: 73,52,30,37,39) implies a higher mean than the full-sample mean. To reflect the recent regime, set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demands, capturing the sustained upshift. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1), so prioritizing service is appropriate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1..P7): 38,73,52,30,37,39,24; recent 5-period mean (P3..P7)=36.4. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default L=0. To reflect the recent post-changepoint regime and prioritize service with moderate holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current demand level across review+lead). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base-stock aligned with current realized demand while the confirmed L=0 avoids over-ordering for lag.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime (periods 1-8 demand: 38,73,52,30,37,39,24,38) versus the earlier 5-sample baseline; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low vs recent demand. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because conclude history confirms 0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime using the last 8 observed demands; this gives the OR engine a demand estimate that responds to the regime shift while keeping safety stock driven by observed variability. This balances high profit (profit/holding -> high target service level) against holding cost by letting the backend compute z* and the capped order accordingly.

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders arrived same period), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 37,39,24,38,31) reflects the sustained higher regime vs earlier samples; to capture the current regime I set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level vs holding cost by focusing the base-stock on current elevated demand while keeping variability measured from the same window.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to cover current+L periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the confirmed higher recent demand to balance profit (high) vs holding cost (low).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1..P11 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been volatile with large upticks in the last two weeks (P10=76, P11=93) compared with earlier weeks; I treat this as a sustained higher recent mean. Set L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (periods 7\u201311) to capture the current higher-volatility regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands, sigma_hat will use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability and avoid understocking against recent spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated demand vs early-sample baseline; last 5 demands = [38,31,76,93,53], recent mean \u224858.2 units. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm lead time=0, so use default L to keep orders same-period. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this prevents understating required base-stock while avoiding excessive holding given Holding=$1 vs Profit=$19.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has shifted upward and last 5 periods (P9..P13 demand = 31,76,93,53,39) represent the current regime; I'll target the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent 5 samples to capture current mean/volatility. L uses promised/confirmed 0 to reflect observed arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 to center base-stock on the recent high-demand regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service (higher m\xfb) against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows elevated and variable weekly sales; to capture current regime I use recent_N on the most recent samples to form (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility. L kept default (promised=0, empirically confirmed). mu_hat and sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 weeks of demand and to balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) for higher service level without excessive inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs early samples (sustained higher weekly demand around 38\u201393 in recent periods). On-hand=51, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover imminent demand; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times are 0. Set L to promised (default=0). For demand stats use recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (last 5 demand samples: P11\u2013P15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service under the recent higher mean while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Feb (earlier carry-over noted). On-hand=6, in-transit=0 so pipeline low; promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I set L=default to use promised (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the most recent regime (last 10 weeks of observed demand are representative and avoid dilution by the small pre-spike sample). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained elevated demand while the sigma estimate supports appropriate safety stock balancing profit ($19) vs $1 holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has accelerated (last 5 period demands: P13..P17 = 39,39,38,86,180) suggesting a higher recent mean and volatility vs older history. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent upshift while limiting noise, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5 corresponds to the most recent coherent regime). This raises the forecast mean ((1+L)*mean of last 5 = ~76.4) and increases safety stock via recent volatility, which helps avoid stockouts given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) while keeping holding exposure controlled.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has risen and become volatile (recent demands: 39, 38, 86, 180, 141). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the recent upward regime and higher volatility I use recent_N (N=5) for both demand mean and sigma so the OR backend builds a base-stock that reflects the last 5 weeks' mean and variability. This keeps service high through the current demand spike while relying on confirmed L=0 (default) so orders arrive same period.

To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, set L to promised (default=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg over last 3 weeks) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand and short lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent history shows multiple confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained demand upshift since Feb\u2013May with large weekly demand volatility and several high-demand weeks in June (peaks to 180+). On-hand = 64, in-transit = 0; with promised lead time = 0 and confirmed 0 in history, use default lead time. To let the OR backend compute its demand forecast and safety stock using all available samples (capturing the recent high-mean, high-variance regime) I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect full-sample statistics. This balances service (avoiding stockouts seen in prior high-demand weeks) against holding cost by relying on the backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed). Demand exhibits a sustained upshift starting around Period 16 (2019-05-27) with much higher weekly sales through Period 21 (six periods: demands 86,180,141,187,147,167). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since conclude history confirms it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to target the new high-demand regime (regime length=6), so (1+L)-scaled mean and std are computed over the last 6 demand observations \u2014 this increases replenishment to meet the elevated demand while keeping volatility measured from the same regime for safety stock calibration.

Current on-hand=109, in-transit=0. Given confirmed lead time=0 and substantial volatile demand, use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this lets the backend balance service level (via its z*) against holding cost using full-sample statistics.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand regime increased sharply starting Period 16 (demands P16..P23 = 86,180,141,187,147,167,103,76). Evidence: mean in this recent window is much higher than earlier history; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded arrivals. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime (N = number of periods since the regime change). This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and the volatility estimate so the OR backend will order toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost via the backend's z* and cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (demands: 180,141,187,147,167,103,76,188) after earlier low-volume weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L using observed average lead time to lock in the confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the recent high-demand regime length from Period 17\u201324) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the review+lead period. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) during the sustained higher-demand regime while still letting the OR backend apply its cap to limit excess inventory and holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 periods. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 167,103,76,188,107) shows a higher, volatile regime vs early data; to size replenishment to current regime and limit excess holding, I use recent_N (N=5) for both demand mean and volatility so base-stock reflects the last 5 weeks. L kept as default (promised). This favors service (high profit/higher q) while sigma from recent data caps order size.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=128, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1..P26 all arrived same period). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime (summer): last 5 weekly demands = [103,76,188,107,78], mean=110.4. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher recent mean ((1+L)*mean of last 5 = 110.4). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding excess holding by using a short, recent window given clear regime shift and current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows high, volatile demand through summer but actual lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. Current on-hand=107, in-transit=0 (healthy on-hand). To avoid overreacting to recent spikes while preserving service, use default estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history with promised lead time. This leverages confirmed L=0 and historical demand to balance profit-driven service level versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201328) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since late May/June (large weekly volumes), and profit/holding implies a high service target (q\u22480.95). No currently overdue shipments. I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand/volatility so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this leverages the long-run data while the high implied service level will raise base-stock to protect against stockouts without my overfitting to recent spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=99, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 22-29) averages ~94.6/week after earlier mid-year surge; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (Periods 1-29 concludes). Inventory is ample relative to recent weekly demand but we keep forecasting based on the most recent stable regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (Periods 22-29). This balances service (captures elevated post-surge weekly mean) while avoiding excess hold by using recent data rather than all-time higher earlier spikes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and a sustained demand upshift starting early Jun (much higher weekly sales since Period ~16). Profit/holding imply very high service target (q\u22480.95). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime, I use a recent-window forecast capturing the last ~20 weeks to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility, while keeping L=promised (default) because concludes confirm 0 lead time. This raises mu_hat to cover current elevated demand while sigma_hat (recent_N) captures recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit margin.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0; demand has been in a higher regime since late spring with variable weekly peaks (many recent weeks 60\u2013180). I set L=default to use promised 0 (matches observed). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting lookback to recent behavior; this increases the base-stock to meet elevated demand but keeps volatility estimate based on recent variability to avoid excessive overstock given $1 holding cost versus $19 profit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=98, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. Recent demand (many weeks since June) is materially higher than the very early Jan samples; to reflect the sustained higher regime I use recent_N over a long recent window to set demand mean and volatility. L kept as default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals repeatedly show 0 lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent high-demand regime (reduces bias from small early-sample means). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while keeping variance estimate grounded in recent weeks.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods) and demand has operated in a higher regime since early periods (sustained elevated weekly demand).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and variable (last 10 demands: 62,107,76,81,39,76,62,83,97,86 \u2014 avg ~79) versus early-season low. On-hand=144, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage for ~2 weeks but not excessive given profit/holding tradeoff. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. To capture the recent sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 10 samples (recent_N N=10) to reflect current mean/volatility; this tightens the base-stock to meet higher service needs while sigma_hat recent_N helps the backend compute an appropriate safety stock without overholding inventory.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0; recent periods show moderate demand (multiple weeks in range ~38\u2013107, with occasional spikes). No evidence of lost shipments. To keep OR backend aligned with observed timely replenishment and broad historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (uses full sample mean) while letting the OR cap limit orders to reasonable levels given profit vs. holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; recent demand since summer remains elevated vs. early-Jan. Given confirmed lead time=0 and ample on-hand, use default estimators (backend uses full-sample mean/std over (1+L) review+lead) so the OR engine computes base_stock consistent with long-run demand while respecting the high service ratio (profit $19 vs hold $1 => q\u22480.95). This avoids manual overcorrection from short recent noise and lets the capped policy limit order size.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 30\u201337) show stabilized elevated weekly demand (samples: 62,107,76,81,39,38,35,63; mean\u224862.6). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 historically. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the most recent stable demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture recent demand volatility. This keeps service high (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while avoiding excess inventory accumulation given current on-hand stock and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time confirmed at 0; demand has been elevated vs initial samples but no new sustained changepoint in last periods (recent weeks demands ~35\u201363). To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and confirmed promised lead time, use default settings so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised. This balances service (use full-data mean) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0; on-hand=128, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since early periods (large jump from Jan samples; recent weeks show moderate weekly demand ~40\u2013180 with many weeks >60). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost (profit=19, holding=1 \u2192 high service quantile), I use L=default (promised/confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N=20 to capture the sustained elevated regime (most recent 20 demand samples reflect current seasonality and variability). Same recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect realized volatility and prevent understocking. These params steer the OR backend to a base-stock that matches current higher demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has softened vs. mid-year spike; last 5 demands = [35,63,41,21,15], mean=35. On-hand=140, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. one-period demand but holding cost is low relative to profit (Profit=$19, Holding=$1). Keep promised lead time (historically 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime and recent variability so the OR backend reduces target base-stock vs. mid-year volumes and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. On-hand=108, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods across many periods. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: P37..P41 = 63,41,21,15,32) averages ~34.4 units/week reflecting the current lower post-peak regime. Profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime mean (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while preserving a high service level, and avoid overstock given already-large on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=81, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201342) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201342 = 21,15,32,27) averages ~23.8/week, lower than earlier seasonal peaks. Promised lead time is 0 and recent concludes confirm it, so use default promised LT. To keep inventory responsive to the most recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (last 4 weeks) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility; this reduces excess holding while maintaining service. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust L upward.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks to low values (last 5 demand samples: 21, 15, 32, 27, 12 \u2192 avg \u224821.4). On-hand=69, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L=default (promised 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and uncertainty (sigma_hat) should reflect the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=5 to weight the most recent weeks. This tightens the base-stock to current demand and lowers safety stock given high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $19).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Recent demand has declined in December (Periods 41-44). To respond to the apparent short-term seasonal drop while preserving responsiveness, keep L at promised (default=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4-week regime (N=4) so the backend bases target stock on the current lower demand and reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand decline confirmed (Periods 41-44): avg demand P41..P44 = 20.75 vs prior P37..P40 = 35.0 (\u221241%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a lower regime (P41..P45 = 32,27,12,12,20; avg \u2248 20.6) and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. On-hand = 37, in-transit = 0; with promised L=0 we only need to cover current-period demand. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the confirmed recent low-demand regime (5 periods of lower demand) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk by aligning the base-stock to the recent lower demand while keeping service against current-period demand; they also respect the confirmed zero lead time so orders can replenish same period.

Lead time history (concluded arrivals) consistently shows 0 periods. To bias orders toward the recent lower regime and limit holding cost, use the recent 6-week regime for demand mean/volatility while keeping promised lead time. This reduces recommended base stock vs. using all-sample mean and preserves service with lower holding cost given low pipeline.
