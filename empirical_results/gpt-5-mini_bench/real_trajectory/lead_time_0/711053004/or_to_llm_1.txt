With no on-hand inventory and low holding cost ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19), it's prudent to bias up to cover a higher recent-run rate and avoid lost sales. I increase OR's recommendation by ~25% (from 72 to 90) to better match the recent demand regime while keeping a modest buffer for uncertainty and possible shipment issues.
