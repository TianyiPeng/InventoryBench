Period 1 (2019/2/11) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar & product: Date is 2019-02-11 (mid-February). Product is a basic long T-shirt (everyday apparel) \u2014 not highly seasonal but demand can rise in early-year rollouts/promotions. No immediate holiday drivers in mid-February aside from Valentine's (minor for basics). b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend over five weeks: 2019-01-07=6, 01-14=13, 01-21=32, 01-28=49, 02-04=62. Exponential/accelerating growth implies current-week demand likely higher (roughly +20\u201340% week-over-week recently). c) Lead time / missing orders: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised lead time=0 but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). Treat lead time as uncertain; cannot rely on past arrivals. d) Inventory & pipeline: With zero on-hand and zero pipeline, we must order to meet current-period demand occurring after ordering plus provide a small buffer for uncertainty. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) vs profit $19/unit, so overstock penalty is small relative to missed-sales cost. e) Order logic: Forecast current-period demand \u224880 units (extrapolating recent trend from 62 with continued growth). Place an order to cover ~1 period of expected demand plus small safety stock. Therefore order 90 units to maximize expected profit while keeping modest holding risk.",

{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period date 2019-02-18 (post-Valentine's). Product is a basic T\u2010shirt; seasonality suggests rising spring demand but no immediate holiday spike. b) Demand regime: historical 5-week uptrend (6\u219262) noted in carry-over. Most recent observed demand (Period 1) = 38, so short-term demand estimate \u2248 40\u201355 units this week; conservative forecast \u224850. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 order arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0). No in-transit stock. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 52 units, which roughly covers the conservative forecast. Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), stocking to sell is attractive but current on-hand is sufficient to meet expected demand without risking holding cost on excess. e) Final order logic: Do not order now (0 units). With observed lead_time=0, same-period orders would arrive, but current on-hand already likely covers demand; ordering extra risks holding cost if demand falls. Monitor next period demand and adjust if a sustained increase is confirmed.",
