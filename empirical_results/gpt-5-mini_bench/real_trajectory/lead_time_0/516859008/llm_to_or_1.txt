Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Small apparel accessory with 5 weeks of recent weekly demand (13,5,15,28,31), mean=18.4 wks. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Promised lead time is 0; no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time shift or lost shipments. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level (captures recent average weekly demand) against holding cost given modest holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly samples through 2019-02-04: [13,5,15,28,31]; Period 1 conclude adds demand=39 and showed an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage. No sustained demand regime shift (only one high demand observation), and observed lead time matches promised (0). Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed 0), and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses all available samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service vs holding cost without overreacting to a single high-demand week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased vs. Jan baseline (recent weeks: 31, 39, 53), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the uplift. Observed concluded lead times from Period 1 and 2 are 0, so use calculated average lead time. Set L via "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses last three samples 2019-02-04, 2019-02-11, 2019-02-18) so the base-stock reflects the recent higher mean and volatility and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals (P1,P2,P3) so actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has jumped (sold 39,53,66) versus older weekly samples (13,5,15,28,31); I detect a sustained upward regime over the last 3 periods and will base forecast on those. Set L to calculated (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $965.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4 actual demands = 39,53,66,52) is substantially above the historical Jan samples (mean 18.4), indicating a sustained upward demand regime for at least 4 periods. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=4 using the last 4 realized demands) and match volatility to the same recent window; keep L as default (promised=0). This raises the base-stock to cover current higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N lets the OR backend size safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Demand has been volatile but we have no new sustained regime change; use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance and promised lead time to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P6). Recent demand has varied but shows no sustained regime change (samples available from Jan\u2013Feb weeks). With lead time confirmed 0, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (same-day arrivals) against holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and no evidence of a new sustained demand spike or drop.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm L=0 (carry-over). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-7) averages ~47.7 units/week, substantially above the older sample set, so I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the new regime. Using recent_N N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend targets service for the current higher-demand regime while L stays default (promised=0). This balances service level (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent observed variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders in P1-P8 arrived same period), so I set L by averaging observed lead times. Demand has shifted upward recently versus the older sample set (recent weeks showing ~50s/week vs earlier historical mean ~18). I therefore use a recent_N forecast to capture the new regime (N=5 covers the most recent 5 demand observations: Periods 4-8). sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service given confirmed 0 lead time while keeping sigma based on recent variability to limit excess holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows steady weekly demand roughly 50\u201366 units with ending on-hand 13 and zero in-transit; prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand (13) provides limited cover for this week's demand. I choose default lead time to use promised/confirmed L=0. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use default (all-sample) estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this is conservative given stable recent demand and confirmed same-period arrivals, and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost automatically.

Use promised lead time (0) and let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so base_stock reflects full historical variability while keeping policy simple given reliable 0 lead time and no in-transit coverage.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 0-period arrivals (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile (last 4 concluded demands: 53, 52, 95, 64) so I bias the forecast toward the most recent regime. Set L=default to trust the confirmed 0-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher/volatile demand pattern while limiting excess holding cost given frequent same-period replenishment.

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 10 (demands: P8-12 = 53,52,95,64,95) vs. earlier historical mean (~18.4). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, no missing shipments and lead time has been consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the confirmed upward demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend builds a higher base-stock and reflects increased mean and volatility while keeping holding cost consideration via the backend service-level formula.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning Period 10 (four periods: P10\u2013P13) vs earlier periods; to capture recent higher demand, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (last 4 concluded demand samples). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and short-term volatility to better service elevated demand while the holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: avg demand before P10 (P1\u2013P9)=48.78, avg demand P10\u2013P13=86.75 (+77.8%)

To protect service during the higher-demand regime while holding cost is low relative to profit, keep L as default (promised 0), set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to target the post-shift mean (1+L)*mean \u2248 93, and set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 10 (higher mean since P10). Given the sustained higher demand (P10\u2013P15 = 6 periods) I use recent_N over that regime to capture the new mean/volatility. L set to default to respect promised 0-day lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect current elevated demand and its variability so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P16). Demand regime shifted up around Period 10 (P1\u2013P9 avg~48.78 vs P10\u2013P13 avg~86.75); recent weeks (P10\u2013P16) remain at the higher level. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, use promised lead time (default=0) and base forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=7 (P10\u2013P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat: N equals the recent regime length (7 weeks), satisfies N\u2208[3,20], and focuses the estimate on the sustained higher-demand period. This raises the backend base-stock to meet current demand while sigma from the same window captures recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Demand regime increased starting Period 10 (sustained higher weekly demand P10\u2013P17); to capture the new regime I use recent_N=8 (Periods 10\u201317) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher demand profile and keep safety stock responsive while minimizing excess holding.

I set L to default (promised lead time=0) since conclude history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 10\u201318) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost considered via the OR backend's service-level cap.

To capture the post-changepoint demand level I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent demand regime (Periods 10\u201319, length=10) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of last 10 samples. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This focuses service on the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost by not using the long-ago low-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 10; recent 11 weeks (P10\u2013P20) show higher mean and similar variability. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). I use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-change higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 11 samples). This concentrates orders to meet the elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed = 0 (arrivals same period consistently) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 10. Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (matches confirmed observations). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the backend combine the full historical demand (including the confirmed post-P10 regime) with its service-level cap. This balances service level vs holding cost given on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (P1\u2013P22) confirm lead time = 0 (arrivals matched same-period orders). A sustained demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 10 (avg before P10=48.78 vs P10\u2013P13=86.75). To reflect the higher recent demand regime, I base the forecast on the most recent regime sample (periods since the changepoint). Therefore: L use default (promised lead time=0). mu_hat use recent_N over the last 13 concluded demand samples covering the post-changepoint regime. sigma_hat use recent_N over the same 13 samples to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 10 (noted earlier); use recent regime data to forecast. Set L to default (promised 0) to match observed 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 10\u201324 length=15) so the OR backend sets base-stock to satisfy the higher demand while limiting holding costs given current healthy on-hand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 10 (carry-over). On-hand=43, in-transit=0, promised LT=0 and historically confirmed LT=0. To capture the post-P10 demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates covering the latest regime (P10\u2013P25, 16 weeks) so the OR backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the higher mean and current variability. Using L=default (promised 0) preserves system assumptions; recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand weeks.

On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given high profit-to-hold ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=17, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P28). Demand shifted up at Period 10 and has remained higher; therefore forecast should emphasize the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 10\u201328, length 19) to capture the higher mean and variability since the changepoint; N=19. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects current volatility; keeping L=0 avoids inflating pipeline and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments; historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand exhibited a sustained regime shift beginning Period 10 (higher mean). To capture the post-shift regime I set lead time to promised (default=0) and estimate demand from the most recent post-change window: use recent_N with N=20 (covers Period 10\u201329) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to protect service while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand 13, in-transit 0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 10 (noted in carry-overs). To capture the higher post-changepoint demand I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (P10\u2013P30 \u2248 21 periods), using the maximum 20-sample window to reflect current demand while limiting noise. This increases service level to avoid stockouts given zero LT and higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (Periods 1\u201331 concluded arrivals = orders). Demand regime increased at Period 10 and has persisted; use recent data to reflect the higher steady regime. Profit=19, holding=1 implies a high service target (q\u22480.95). Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise; this gives the OR engine an up-to-date mean and volatility for (1+L)-period demand and balances service level vs holding cost given the high profit/holding ratio.

Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 10 (higher mean). To reflect the post-change regime, I use recent_N over the most recent 20 demand samples (regime length since P10 >20) for both demand mean and volatility. L kept as default (promised = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward the current higher-demand regime while keeping cap calculations responsive to recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given on-hand is low and no pipeline exists.

Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 10 (higher mean through recent periods). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I keep L at the promised/default (0, consistent with confirmed lead time) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the latest 20 weeks of demand after the regime change) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock reflecting the current higher demand and recent volatility.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 and no missing shipments; demand regime increased starting Period 10 (already recorded). To balance profit ($19) vs holding ($1) I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand mean and volatility use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (P15\u2013P34 are most relevant and using 20 weeks smooths noise while reacting to regime shift). These parameters give the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean and std to drive a base-stock that maintains service while limiting inventory holding.

I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=20 (captures the most recent 20 weeks of the post-changepoint regime) so the OR backend sets base-stock to meet elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances profit-driven service level (high profit $19) against holding cost $1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Demand regime increased around Period 10 and has persisted; recent weeks remain elevated and variable (several large spikes P33, P37). To keep service (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding stockouts, use promised lead time (default=0) and base forecasts on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures latest 20 periods of higher-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base-stock and accounts for recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 10; recent demand remains in that higher regime. To capture the current higher mean and volatility while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 0, I use recent_N over the most recent data (capped at 20 weeks) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the latest regime behavior and its volatility. This balances service (higher mean \u2192 larger base stock) against holding cost by relying on recent observations rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2013P39 evidence). Demand regime increased starting Period 10 (previous insight). To capture the elevated, sustained post-P10 demand I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime: choose N=20 (per rules: min(regime_length,20), regime well over 20 periods since P10). This biases mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent higher-demand behavior and keeps L=default (promised 0) consistent with observed arrivals. These parameters help the OR backend raise base stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data informs safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201340 arrivals all same-period). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 10 (P1\u2013P9 avg=48.78 vs P10\u2013P13 avg=86.75; sustained thereafter). I therefore keep L at promised (default=0) and set demand estimates using the recent post-changepoint data. Use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, cap to 20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent mean and recent volatility; this biases orders toward higher service (appropriate given high profit/low holding cost) while limiting sensitivity to very short-term noise.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 10; recent weeks (months) remain volatile but at the higher mean. To protect service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) I use a recent-window forecast to capture the post-P10 regime while keeping L as promised. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised lead time=0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean from the most recent 20 demand samples reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances higher service level (reduce lost sales) against modest holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 (consistent across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 10 to materially higher demand (recorded earlier). With lead time confirmed as 0 and a long high-demand regime (P10\u2013P42, >20 samples), I focus forecasting on the most recent regime to avoid dilution from early low-demand samples. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures latest 20 weeks of elevated demand) so the OR backend calculates base stock and cap from the recent high-demand mean and volatility, improving service during this sustained higher-demand period while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's q tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (P10\u2013P13 increase). Recent demand is variable but shows no new sustained changepoint (single low week P43 likely post-promo noise). Given confirmed L=0 and no new regime change, use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This leverages all history, preserves the high service quantile implied by profit/holding (q=0.95), and avoids overreacting to the most recent noisy dip while keeping holding cost discipline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 10 (sustained higher mean) and recent weeks include holiday-season variability (Dec). To keep service high while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent stable/high-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (reflecting the post-P10 higher-demand regime and recent holiday volatility). This increases the base-stock to match elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability for safety stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent history (Periods 1\u201345) shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 10. Current on-hand=17, in-transit=0 (no arrivals visible). Promised lead time remains 0 and historical demand is long and stable enough under the elevated regime to use the backend defaults. Using default L lets OR use the promised lead time (0). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the backend's high service-level (profit/(profit+holding)=0.95) will drive sufficiently large base-stock while capping orders to its safety-cap \u2014 this balances high profit per unit vs low holding cost given no evidence of new regime or lost shipments.

Use default (promised) lead time so OR backend uses observed same-period arrivals; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding costs given current on-hand and no pipeline.
