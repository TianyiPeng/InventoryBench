Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 0, but no concluded arrivals in history to confirm actual lead time; treat promised lead time as current best estimate (L=0) and be conservative about overstock. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because holding cost ($1/unit/period) equals profit ($1/unit), leftover inventory strictly reduces objective; therefore avoid significant over-ordering. Order to cover roughly one week of expected demand (L+1 = 1 period) using recent mean but slightly conservative given late-Jan peak and Feb decline. Final order: 100 units.",
