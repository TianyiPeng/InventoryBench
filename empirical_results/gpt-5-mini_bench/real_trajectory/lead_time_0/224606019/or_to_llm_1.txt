Demand analysis: historical samples give mean \u03bc\u0304\u224849.2 (5-sample mean used by OR), which is why OR's base policy (with q=0.5) recommends ~67. However, realized customer demand in recent periods was much higher: Period1 demand=72 (sold 50 due to stockout) and Period2 demand=150 (sold 60 due to stockout). These two periods imply expected current-period demand \u2248111 units (simple average of 72 and 150). Given lead time=0, orders arrive within this period and will satisfy demand this period.
