Recent realized demand (Periods 42\u201345) = [41, 28, 3, 56], 4-period average \u2248 32 units; longer recent window shows low-to-moderate seasonal demand. Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so stocking to meet demand is profitable, but excess inventory incurs holding cost each period. OR recommends 113 but that builds extra inventory unnecessarily given lead time=0 and current on-hand>expected demand. Final strategy: place no order this period (order=0).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history through Period 46 shows every order that was placed arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered for P1\u2013P46), so actual lead time = 0 (matches earlier confirmed insight). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 12, in-transit = 0, so available now = 12. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen substantially from mid-year peaks; last four concluded demands (P43\u2013P46) = 28, 3, 56, 29 \u2192 4-week average \u2248 29 units/week and recent median \u2248 28. Given lead time 0, any order placed will arrive this period and be available to meet current-period demand. OR recommended 141 units (uses long-run historical means and a high critical fractile), but that would create large holding cost exposure given current subdued demand. Strategy: target a conservative replenishment to cover roughly 1\u20131.5 weeks of expected demand plus modest safety stock. Target stock \u2248 40\u201345 units (\u22481.3\xd7 recent weekly avg). With on-hand 12, order = 40 \u2212 12 = 28 (round to 30 for integer and slight safety). This limits holding cost while avoiding stockouts if demand reverts to recent average or has a small uptick around year-end. Communication: I deviate down from OR (141\u219230) because actual lead time = 0 and recent demand is ~29/week; large OR order risks overstock and holding cost without evidence of renewed high demand.",
