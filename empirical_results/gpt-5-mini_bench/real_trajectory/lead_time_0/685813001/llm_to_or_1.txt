Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 685813001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals exist so no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=82 units/week and modest volatility (std \u22484.3\u20134.8). Promised lead time is used (default L=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (meeting ~82 units expected weekly demand) against holding cost given current zero inventory and no lead-time signal.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical weekly demand samples average ~82 units (samples: 75,84,83,80,88). Current on-hand=36, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Promised lead time=0 and one concluded observation showed lead_time=0 (single sample). Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this targets the baseline service level given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to a single low-sale week (Period1 sold=51).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (both arrived same period). Historical demand samples (five weekly observations) have mean ~82 units/week. On-hand and in-transit are zero, so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirms 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the historical forecast and uncertainty for the OR engine.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed concluded demands: Period1 sold=51, Period2 sold=96, Period3 sold=92 (up from historical Jan samples 75\u201388). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time used (default) since all concluded lead times = 0. To capture the recent uptick while remaining responsive, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses mean of last 3 concluded demands scaled by 1+L). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given zero on-hand/pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples average ~82 units. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical conclude messages show orders arriving same period. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend infer actual lead time from observed concludes (will be 0). I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a base-stock anchored to the historical mean while accounting for observed lead-time behavior. This balances service (cover ~1 week demand) vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (arrivals observed in Periods 1-4: orders placed and arrived same period).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P5) show same-period arrivals and stable weekly demand (historical weekly samples mean=82). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time (all observed = 0). I choose mu_hat='default' to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline weekly demand \u224882). I choose sigma_hat='default' to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (captures observed variability). These settings keep the base-stock tied to proven demand/lead-time, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given modest holding penalty.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded weekly demand (Periods 1-6) = [51,96,92,76,74,61] \u2014 recent mean \u224875; on-hand=30, in-transit=0 so coverage is low for upcoming demand. All concluded arrivals show lead time 0, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent 6 weeks (captures current regime ~75 units/week) so OR backend sets base stock to meet (1+L)\xb7recent mean while reflecting recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low in-transit) against holding cost by not inflating demand with older, higher Jan samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) from Periods 1\u20137 and current on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand (Periods 1\u20137): 51,96,92,76,74,61,54; historical Jan samples: 75,84,83,80,88. No clear sustained upward shift; recent weeks show moderate decline versus Jan baseline. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all available samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, giving a balanced forecast and volatility estimate. This avoids overreacting to short-term downward fluctuation while ensuring orders plus on-hand cover (L+1) periods of demand. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, the backend will set service-level via q and the capped order cap.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20138) shows frequent same-period arrivals and volatile weekly demand (recent demands: 51,96,92,76,74,61,54,84). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so coverage is very low for upcoming demand. Carry-over confirms lead time=0 (sustained evidence P1\u2013P8). I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimation so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from the full sample set; this is conservative given confirmed 0 lead time and variable demand while avoiding overfitting to recent weeks and keeping holding cost pressure in mind.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows all orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 consistently) so use promised/confirmed lead time 0. Demand in last 5 concluded periods (P5\u2013P9: 74,61,54,84,62) indicates a lower recent mean (~67) vs earlier samples; use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean to capture this regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to current lower demand while preserving service given zero lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

With lead time confirmed as 0 and no overdue shipments, use default calculations so the OR backend uses the full sample mean/variance across all available demand data to set base stock. This balances service (capture ~weekly demand) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every observed period (Periods 1\u201312). Recent demand (Periods 7\u201312 = 54,84,62,32,50,98) shows higher variability and a late spike; I detect a recent regime for demand so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last N=6 samples to capture current mean and volatility. Using L=default (promised lead time=0) ensures orders are sized for same-period fulfillment; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets current demand level and variability so the OR backend's base-stock balances service (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent weekly demand (Periods 9-13 = 62,32,50,98,62) centers around ~61 units with elevated volatility vs. the sparse Jan samples. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit $4 vs holding $1), I use a short recent window (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime rather than older Jan data.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and moderate demand variability; on-hand=64, in-transit=0 so available coverage for current period is 64. To maintain service while limiting holding cost, I set lead time to be inferred from observed data and let the OR engine compute demand forecasts from full sample history: L use 'calculate' (avg observed lead times = 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This leverages confirmed 0 lead time and lets the engine balance profit vs holding cost automatically.

Demand has declined since winter; however samples provided (Jan weeks) seed the forecast. Profit/holding ratio (4/1) implies a high service target. Using default lead time and default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR backend compute base_stock and cap consistent with promised lead time=0 while reflecting historical variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (Periods 1\u201318 arrivals same period). Recent weekly demand has trended lower than the initial Jan samples but evidence is not a sustained regime shift (needs 3+ periods of consistent change beyond noise). Use default lead time to reflect confirmed promised lead time=0 and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so orders remain responsive while preserving statistical smoothing. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by letting backend set base-stock from full-sample mean/variance.

Historical weekly demand shows a clear downward trend from ~80s (Feb\u2013Apr) to low teens recently (May\u2013Jun); no sustained changepoint requiring a new forecast method. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand moments so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base-stock and cap; this balances service (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and low recent demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined sharply (Periods 16-20 demands = 23,16,12,8,6). Promised lead time=0 and historical conclues confirm lead time=0, so use default lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (weights demand mean over last 5 periods multiplied by (1+L)). Volatility is also computed from the same recent 5 samples (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) to reflect reduced variability. These choices keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service during current low-demand regime.

Given stable regime and confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all samples to set base-stock. This keeps orders aligned with historical mean demand (covers review+lead period) and limits excess holding cost while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (seed) avg=82; recent weeks show a sustained drop (recent 5-week avg ~31). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To keep the OR backend conservative and consistent with its expectations, use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service vs. holding cost given low current on-hand and no pipeline while acknowledging a sustained lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: baseline seed avg=82 (Jan samples) vs recent Periods 21-25 avg=31 (\u221262%), sustained over 5 periods

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has dropped sharply vs Jan baseline: Periods 21-25 avg \u224831 units vs baseline seed avg\u224882 (\u221262%), sustained for 5 periods. On-hand=54, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201326). Set L=default to rely on promised lead time (confirmed as 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (use last 5 periods to avoid overstock). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to limit holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower demand level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting ~Period 21 (Periods 21-25 avg\u224831, confirmed Periods 21-27 remaining low except an observed spike at Period 27 likely a transient surge). No overdue shipments. Set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the recent low-demand regime (regime length 7 periods: Periods 21-27). This reduces target base_stock to avoid excess holding cost while still covering the (1+L) demand window and some variability.

Demand regime has been lower since Periods 21-25; recent weeks (Periods 24-28) show varied but subdued demand versus Jan baseline. Use promised lead time (default) to reflect confirmed 0. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations, capturing the current lower regime. Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost >0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (periods 21-29 demands = [20,46,35,18,36,24,73,55,34], recent average ~36 vs historical Jan baseline ~82). No evidence shipments are delayed (lead time confirmed 0 in prior concludes). To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (Periods 21-29, length=9). I keep L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Using recent_N (N=9) focuses the backend forecast on the current lower demand, reducing overstock risk while allowing the OR engine cap to limit order volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows mixed signals: a sustained low-demand regime was observed around Periods 21-25 (avg~31), but the last 5 weeks (Periods 26-30) have mean demand ~54.8 with notable volatility (weeks: 24,73,55,34,88). No overdue arrivals visible in concluded history (all prior concluded arrivals were same-period). To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time to default (promised 0, confirmed historically). Forecast demand using recent_N N=5 to capture the latest post-shift pattern (gives responsiveness to the recent rebound), and estimate demand volatility from the same recent 5 weeks so the OR engine sizes safety stock for current variability. This keeps orders responsive to current trend while limiting excess inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1-31). Recent demand has rebounded strongly: Periods 27-31 demands = [73,55,34,88,106], mean \u224871.2 and high volatility. To prioritize service and reflect the recent uptick, set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the base-stock to the last 5 periods' mean demand ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent volatility for safety stock. This balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp 3-week surge (Periods 30-32 demands = 88, 106, 142; recent 3-week avg = 112) after a prolonged low-demand regime earlier (Periods 21-25 avg \u224831). Given the clear recent uptick over the last 3 periods and zero inventory, I use recent_N=3 for both demand mean and volatility to capture the current high-demand regime. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead time=0. These parameters prioritize service during the apparent surge while the OR backend caps order size; using recent data reduces stockouts now while limiting long-term holding cost exposure if the spike is short-lived.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a strong upward shift starting Period 30 (demands: P30=88, P31=106, P32=142, P33=261) vs the low mid-summer regime (Periods 21-25 avg=31). Lead time history consistently showed 0-period actual lead time through Period 33, so use default promised L. To react to the clear recent spike while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (the four-period spike). This focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand regime and raises the base-stock and safety stock appropriately; default L keeps (1+L) scaling consistent with observed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed starting Period 30: avg(P30-33)=149.25 vs prior mid-summer avg(P21-25)=31 (+381%), sustained over 4 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 historically and recent arrivals (Periods 30-34) show a sustained demand spike. I set L=default (use promised lead time 0). To capture the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 30-34), which biases orders toward the higher current demand while letting the backend apply the service-level cap given profit vs holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand 17, in-transit 0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand spike beginning Period 30 (Periods 30-35 high: 88,106,142,261,156,191 with recent avg ~171). Given the sustained high-demand regime (5 most recent concluded periods), I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean \u2248171 units demand per period over the review+lead window) so the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand while letting the capped order size moderate risk. This balances the $4 profit against $1 holding cost by biasing toward higher fill-rate during the confirmed spike but keeping volatility accounted for via recent 5-period std.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand spike starting Period 30 (recent demands P31-36 = [106,142,261,156,191,137], recent avg \u2248165.5). Expect (L+1) review window demand to be guided by these recent high weeks. I keep L='default' (promised 0) since concludes consistently show 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (uses mean of P31-36) and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility; these choices keep the OR backend focused on current spike, raising base-stock to avoid stockouts while controlling holding via measured recent variance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1-P37). Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 30 (P30-37 = 8 weeks) \u2014 recent weeks show much higher demand vs mid-summer. To protect service during this sustained spike while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default=0) and compute demand forecasts from the recent high-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 8 samples (N=8) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility so the OR engine raises base-stock appropriately given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (P30-38 demands: 88,106,142,261,156,191,137,155,230) \u2014 clear spike vs prior mid-summer low. To cover current review+lead period and prioritize service while controlling holding cost, set L based on observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (the confirmed spike regime length) so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock tuned to current high-variance, high-mean regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals; lead time confirmed 0. Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime from Period 30\u201339 (recent 10 periods avg demand=162.9/week vs prior mid-summer avg=31). To capture the elevated demand and higher variability, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 10-week high-demand regime and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This increases target base stock to avoid stockouts given low pipeline and high recent sales while the OR backend will cap orders; chosen methods balance service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike persists: Period 30\u201339 avg=162.9 vs prior mid-summer avg(P21-25)=31 (+426%), sustained over 10 periods

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To respect the recent sustained spike I set L to default (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets the elevated demand regime (covers review+lead period = 1\xd7recent mean). This increases target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed high-demand period while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 (several weeks of elevated weekly sales through Period 41). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 => low immediate cover versus ongoing high demand; no evidence of lost shipments (arrivals have consistently concluded with lead_time=0). I set L to default (promised 0) because lead time has been reliably observed as 0. To capture the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, weighting the last 12 observed demand samples (Periods 30\u201341) so the backend raises target base-stock and accounts for elevated variability. This increases service level during the sustained spike while the cap prevents extreme single-period ordering and holding-cost exposure.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has surged (last 5 concluded demands P38\u2013P42 = 230,163,158,195,420; avg\u2248233). To meet very high recent demand while balancing holding cost, use promised lead time (L=0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained high-demand regime and elevated variance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=159, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (P41-43) show elevated holiday demand (195,420,166) on top of the sustained autumn spike; I expect demand to remain above the long-run baseline short-term. Promised lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed historically), so keep L=default. To capture the recent elevated regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples to reflect current holiday + spike variability). This balances service (higher mean/variance) versus holding cost by letting the OR backend compute a higher base-stock and a capped order to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=1 and profit=4.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand elevated: Periods 41-43 avg=260.33 vs Period 30-39 avg=162.9 (+60%), sustained over 3 periods

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201344). Recent demand shows a sustained holiday spike beginning around Period 41 (high sales P41\u2013P44). On-hand=105, in-transit=0 so we should plan for elevated near-term demand. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the immediate holiday regime (Periods 41\u201344) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting high immediate demand while keeping holding cost in mind since lead time=0 and we observe same-period replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

To capture the current elevated regime and avoid stockouts during the holiday peak, set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock on the last 5 weeks' elevated mean and volatility. This raises target stock to match holiday demand while sigma_recent helps size safety stock, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand shows elevated holiday/weekend activity (Periods 42-46: 420,166,211,163,87). To capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to a single extreme (420), I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the holiday-average demand (periods 42\u201346). L kept as default (promised=0) because arrival history consistently shows 0 lead time. These params steer the OR engine toward higher target stock for service during holiday spike while sigma_hat from recent data increases safety stock appropriately.
