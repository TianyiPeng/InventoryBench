Product is a basic men's sweatshirt (seasonally relevant in winter). Demand regime analysis: recent historical weekly demand for SKU 685813001: 2019-01-07:75, 01-14:84, 01-21:83, 01-28:80, 02-04:88. Mean = 82 units/week, no obvious upward/downward trend across these 5 weeks and variance is moderate. Lead time vs missing orders: supplier promised LT=0; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict this. Cannot infer any LT deviation yet. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing to satisfy Period 1 demand. Cost tradeoff: profit = $4/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. Given reasonably stable recent demand and significant per-unit holding cost (25% of profit), avoid large safety overstock.
