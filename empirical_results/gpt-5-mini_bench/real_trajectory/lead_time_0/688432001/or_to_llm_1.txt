OR recommended 44 units (capped policy using promised L and historical data). Decision: follow OR recommendation. Rationale: OR's capped recommendation (44) prudently increases available stock to 85 units (on-hand + order = 41+44 = 85), which covers recent mid-range weekly demand (e.g., 86 in P43) without creating excessive ending inventory given holding cost equals profit and the ability to reorder same period if demand runs higher. Adjustment path: no override \u2014 accept OR's 44 to balance stockout risk from intermittent spikes against high holding cost and the confirmed zero lead time.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR's 44 units \u2014 with lead time confirmed 0 and holding cost = profit, 44 units brings availability to 85 (41 on-hand + 44 order), covering typical recent demand without creating excessive ending inventory.",
