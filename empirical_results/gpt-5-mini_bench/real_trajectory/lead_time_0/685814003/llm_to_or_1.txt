Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals available to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~78 units/week and moderate variance. Promised lead time used (default) because no observed lead-time data; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This keeps forecasts grounded in available history while avoiding overreaction to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=78 (samples:75,51,57,123,84). Period 1 concluded an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=102, lead_time=0). No evidence of lead-time drift or sustained demand regime change. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend treats L=0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a baseline forecast (weekly mean=78) while avoiding overreaction to a single low recent sale (49). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with holding cost conservatively given limited new evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=78 (samples:75,51,57,123,84). Two concluded arrivals (P1,P2) both show lead_time=0. No sustained changepoint in demand yet (P2 high demand appears isolated). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals; mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 78; sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability. These settings balance service (covering expected weekly demand) against holding cost given low profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals and reported lead_times = 0. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples mean = 78 units (samples: 75,51,57,123,84). Expected (1+L) demand \u224878, so current on-hand covers most but not all expected demand (short \u224818). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (78) and sigma_hat=default to use overall sample volatility. These params ask the OR backend to target the profit-driven service level while avoiding excess holding given moderate holding cost; they balance service with holding by using historical mean and overall volatility and by relying on observed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand samples {75,51,57,123,84}. On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Lead time confirmed as 0 in recent periods, so use promised/default lead time. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to center forecast on historical mean (mean=78) and default volatility to reflect observed sample variability. This balances service (covering expected demand) against holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and confirmed L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $250.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=30, in-transit=0, recent concluded demands: 49,123,48,59,70. No overdue shipments; prior periods confirm actual lead time = 0. Use L default to keep promised 0. Use mu_hat default to anchor forecast to full-sample mean (stable historical series) and sigma_hat default for volatility; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Current on-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-6) shows all orders arrived same period \u2192 lead time consistently 0. Demand history is variable but no sustained regime change detected; no upcoming calendar spikes. To keep policy stable and let OR engine use full-sample statistics, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances high service level (profit/holding => q=0.8) with inventory cost while relying on confirmed lead-time=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and weekly demands from history averaging ~78 units/week (historical samples: 75,51,57,123,84 => mean 78). On-hand = 78, in-transit = 0, so current inventory equals the 1+L demand forecast. I keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded history) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples. This avoids over-ordering given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4, and leverages confirmed zero lead time to align pipeline with weekly demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical baseline samples (2019-01) mean=78 units/week; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-8) shows variability but no sustained regime shift. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). To keep the OR engine aligned with the promised lead time and long-run demand baseline, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This favors a stable base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while not overreacting to short noisy swings.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 values provided) show stable mid-range sales with no recent loss or lead-time deviation; past concluded periods confirm lead time = 0. No evidence of a regime shift; maintain baseline forecasting so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat keeps orders aligned with observed demand and balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-10) averages ~45.3 units/week; on-hand=69, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~1.5 weeks. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (carry-over). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). To reflect the most recent regime and keep orders responsive to current lower demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (the last 10 observed demand samples). This keeps the OR backend forecast aligned to recent demand and limits excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent weekly demand samples (historic: 75,51,57,123,84) show mean ~78 and moderate volatility. On-hand=52, in-transit=0; prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent arrivals each period). No evidence of lost shipments or sustained regime change. Given profit $4 vs holding $1 (high target service level), use default estimates so OR backend applies full-sample mean/SD and promised lead time=0; this balances high service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost while leveraging confirmed zero lead time.

Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=46, in-transit=0; recent realized weekly demand has been much lower than the original Jan samples. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (Period 4 conclude). I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the last 12 observed demands (Periods 1-12) because a sustained, lower-demand regime is evident (12 samples) \u2014 this yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast aligned to recent behavior and reduces overstock risk. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep service reasonable while lowering holding cost given the persistent drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical sample mean=78.0 (2019-01 samples) vs recent 12-period mean=42.75 (Periods 1-12), drop of 35.25 units (-45.2%), sustained for 12 periods

Recent demand shows a sustained regime drop (Periods 1-12 mean=42.75 vs historical sample mean=78). To respect the confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, I use recent data for forecast and volatility: set L to promised (0), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (N=12) to avoid overstocking while maintaining service.

Historical Jan samples are much higher, but a sustained demand drop was detected (recent 12-period mean much lower, confirmed Period 13). To reflect the new lower regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are driven by the recent 12 periods. Keep L at default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given current lower demand and existing on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods (Periods 1-18 arrivals all same-period). Given the sustained lower regime, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable 12-period regime, which reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1 favors higher service but recent lower demand argues for conservative stocking).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods) and a sustained demand drop vs Jan samples (recent regime used). To avoid excess inventory given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, I use the recent demand regime (most recent 12 periods) to set forecast and volatility. L uses default (promised=0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent-12 mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent-12 std, reducing target base stock to match the lower sustained demand and limit holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand has exhibited a sustained downward regime since Period 1\u201312 with recent 12-period mean = 42.75 (drop ~45% vs Jan samples) \u2014 evidence: Periods 1\u201312 consecutive lower demand and recorded carry-over insight at Period 13. To avoid overstock I set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime ((1+L)*mean over last 12 periods). For volatility I use recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices reduce target base-stock to align with the new lower-demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service given very short lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been in the lower regime (carry-over noted: mean drop ~45% vs historical Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L to default (use promised lead time 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures full historical+recent data while backend's base-stock calculation balances profit vs holding cost). No explicit adjustments for lost/delayed shipments are needed given confirmed lead time=0 and no missing concludes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in the lower regime for 12+ periods (recent 12-period mean=42.75 vs historical Jan mean=78). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 0; keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=12 so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 12 observed demands. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given confirmed lower demand.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To target service while limiting holding cost, keep L at promised (default 0) and base demand forecast on the most recent 12 periods to capture the new lower-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base stock to the recent regime mean with matching volatility, avoiding overstock from older high-demand samples.

Demand experienced a sustained downward regime starting around Period 13 (recent 12-period mean used). To keep service high given profit/holding (q=0.8) but avoid excess inventory under the lower recent demand regime, I use promised/default lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 12 periods to reflect the sustained lower demand. This balances fill rate (high z*) versus holding cost under the new regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 1-12 average=42.75 (sustained drop vs historical samples). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L via calculate (uses observed lead times=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to anchor mu_hat to the sustained lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to capture current volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk vs using older higher historical mean while respecting confirmed zero lead time so orders can replenish same period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 1-12 recent mean=42.75 vs historical 78). Lead time has been reliably 0 (confirmed earlier). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and recent variance; this keeps base-stock aligned to current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given current demand pattern.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 13 but recent weeks (Periods 20-27) exhibit volatile spikes. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default L=0. To capture recent demand momentum while still damping noise, set mu_hat using EWMA (gamma=0.3) so recent spikes influence forecast but do not dominate. To capture recent volatility after the regime shift, set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (periods 13-27) to reflect the post-changepoint variance.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (recent 12-period mean used) and confirmed same-day arrivals historically. On-hand=74, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed as 0 in history). Use mu_hat recent_N N=12 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces target base stock vs historical 2019-Jan samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings keep orders responsive to current lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. To protect service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecasts on the most recent 12 periods to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime; apply same recent window to volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (carry-over confirmed). Demand exhibited a sustained lower regime earlier (carry-over) but recent weeks (summer) show higher and variable demand; to capture the recent regime and volatility I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 12 weeks. L set to default (promised=0) since concluded data confirms 0. mu_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand level; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (responding to recent spikes) against holding cost by updating both mean and variance from the latest regime.

Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained recent regime I use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base stock to the recent demand level over the (1+L) review+lead horizon; L left at default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals show 0 lead time. This balances service (using recent demand evidence) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history (Periods 13-32) shows a sustained lower demand regime vs the 2019-Jan samples; on-hand=3, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty and stockouts occurred frequently in recent weeks. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (consistent through Period 32). I therefore use promised/default lead time. For demand forecast I rely on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=20 (Periods 13-32) to capture the sustained lower mean and volatility rather than older high-Jan samples. This keeps base_stock aligned to current lower demand and reduces excess holding while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical Jan-2019 mean=78 but a sustained demand drop was recorded at Period 13 (recent 12-period mean 42.75); recent regime persists through Period 33. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in multiple concludes. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use L=default (promised=0) and set demand parameters using recent data: mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime. I choose recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing overstating base stock while keeping enough safety for variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts observed recently) vs holding cost given zero on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical series shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 26 (2019-08) with large weekly demands through Period 34 (demands P26\u2013P34 = 117,154,102,67,108,121,115,105,210). This appears to be a new higher-demand regime vs the low-demand regime observed earlier. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). For demand I focus on the most recent confirmed regime (Periods 26\u201334, length=9) and use recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock and cap on the recent high-demand behavior, balancing higher service level now needed against holding cost.

To keep inventory lean after the sustained lower-demand regime, use promised lead time (default L=0) and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent 12 periods (recent_N=12) so the OR engine targets service with lower base stock and reduced holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 25\u201336) shows a sustained high-demand regime vs the earlier low regime referenced in carry-over. I set L=default because lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 25\u201336) because these 12 periods show a clear, sustained increase (mean=107) vs the prior recent mean (~42.75) \u2014 this captures the current high-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. For volatility I also use recent_N N=12 to reflect realized variability in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the current higher demand while keeping safety stock tied to observed recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: recent Periods 25\u201336 mean=107.0 vs prior recent mean=42.75 (increase +64.25 units, +150.3%), sustained for 12 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Periods 1\u201337 arrivals matched orders). Demand regime increased starting Period 25 and has remained elevated through Period 37 (use most recent regime data). Set L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (Periods 25\u201337) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR engine raises base stock to meet current demand while accounting for holding cost (q=0.8 implies higher service level but we keep recent statistics to avoid over/under-shoot).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical carry-over shows two sustained demand regimes; most relevant is the higher-demand regime starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201336 mean=107). Lead time has been consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the OR engine to the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 25\u201336). This raises the base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the sigma estimate uses the same recent window to reflect realized volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime since Period 25 (recorded previously), but last three demands (P37\u2013P39) are mixed (74, 30, 159). Because lead time has been consistently observed as 0, keep L=default. To capture the recent elevated regime while smoothing week-to-week noise, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 12 demand samples (captures the post-changepoint regime). Similarly set sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting higher current demand while using recent volatility to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 25 (higher demand sustained through recent periods). Recent weeks (Periods 39-40 demands 159,190) confirm elevated demand. To protect service level while minimizing holding cost, I use the promised/default lead time (0, confirmed by concludes) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 25\u201340 length=16). This biases the backend base-stock toward the higher recent mean and scales volatility from the same recent window so the capped order respects the surge while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $604.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 25 (sustained spike through Period 41). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the (1+L) periods ahead. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show 0 lead time. I therefore use L=default to keep backend's lead time = promised (0). For demand I select recent_N to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 25\u201341, length 17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the most recent 17 samples; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained uptick while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances service level (using recent demand mean and variance) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (high service quantile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 39\u201342) show a sharp, sustained demand surge (159,190,205,404) likely holiday/seasonal lift. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0. To react quickly to the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (the four most recent weeks) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the elevated mean and increased volatility while the cap limits extreme orders. This balances higher service level during the holiday spike against holding cost risk once demand reverts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: recent Periods 39\u201342 mean=239.5 vs prior Periods 25\u201336 mean=107.0 (+132.5 units, +123.8%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=261, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time = 0 (consistent recent arrivals). Recent demand shows a strong holiday spike (Periods 39\u201342 high, Period 43 lower but recent 5-period mean remains elevated). To capture the current high mean and volatility while relying on confirmed lead time=0, set L to default (promised 0). Use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the latest holiday-demand regime (weights the large recent demands) and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect increased short-term volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to current high demand but limited by the backend cap and the large on-hand stock, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand elevated since Period 39 (notable spike Nov onward) but still short-run noisy; on-hand=180, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically confirmed 0). To prioritize service during this seasonal/high-demand window, set lead time to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand parameters focusing on the most recent regime (Periods 39\u201344 length=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean/volatility and avoid dilution by older low-demand periods. This raises base-stock to protect against stockouts while holding cost remains moderate (profit $4 vs hold $1). No explicit adjustment for lost shipments needed.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=152, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=0 (sustained). Profit=$4, Holding=$1 \u2192 service quantile q=0.8, so OR will seek high fill rate. Recent demand regime shows elevated and volatile demand since Period 39 (large spikes into Nov/Dec) and the last 12 weeks (Periods 34\u201345) include the holiday surge; to capture the most relevant elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=12 for both demand mean and std. L uses default (promised lead time=0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. This balances higher service level for the holiday surge while letting the backend compute base_stock and cap using recent demand estimates.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 39 (large uptick through Nov\u2013Dec). Current on-hand=120, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default (promised 0) to match confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the recent high-demand regime (Periods 35\u201346 include the holiday surge and the changepoint at Period 39); this gives the OR engine a forecast centered on the recent elevated mean while keeping sensitivity to recent variance. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility during the holiday spike. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the current high-demand regime while sigma based on recent volatility controls the safety-stock and limits excessive holding cost.
