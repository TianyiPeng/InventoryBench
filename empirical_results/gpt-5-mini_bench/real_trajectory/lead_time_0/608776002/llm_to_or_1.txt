Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [196,255,294,212,190], mean ~229.4, std ~42.9. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period and no concluded lead-time evidence exists. Promised lead time is 0 and no observed arrivals to infer a different L, so use default lead time. Demand exhibits no recent changepoint (5 stable weekly samples), so use default demand estimates based on all samples. Using defaults lets the OR backend compute base_stock consistent with supplied profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overfitting to noise given lack of new signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history: Period1 order of 303 arrived same period (lead_time observed=0); ending on-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (five): mean=229.4, no evidence of a sustained demand shift (only Jan samples available). No overdue shipments. I choose default lead time (promised=0) because concluded history shows 0 and there is no sustained contrary evidence. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance adjusted by (1+L), providing a baseline base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost without overfitting to few recent points.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two orders (P1,P2) both arrived with lead_time=0 and demand recently 233 and 271. On-hand=25, in-transit=0 \u2192 pipeline low but no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (avg=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples (stable pre-Feb samples + recent weeks) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given profit vs holding cost while not overreacting to only two recent weeks of higher demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3179.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (lead_time observed=0 each). Demand history includes legacy samples (196,255,294,212,190) and recent period demands (233,271,174) \u2014 no sustained upward shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed service performance and promised lead time, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit/higher q) with low holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=153, in-transit=0. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (P1-P4 arrivals same period). Demand history shows moderate variability but no sustained regime shift. To let the OR engine use the full sample set and the confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand has shifted down recently: last 3 observed demands = [174,145,162] (Periods 3-5) vs earlier samples ~230s. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given the sustained lower demand in the most recent 3 weeks, set L to promised (default 0) and forecast demand using recent_N on the last 3 samples (N=3). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) so variability reflects the new, lower-volatility regime. These choices reduce target base stock compared with using all-sample averages, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=42, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows lead time confirmed as 0. Demand history shows weekly variability but no sustained regime change (demands: 233,271,174,145,162,143 plus earlier Jan samples). Profit/holding ratio is high (q\u22480.95) so OR will target a high service level; to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuation I use defaults so the backend computes L=promised, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service vs holding given confirmed 0 lead time and no new sustained demand shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=156, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Recent demand has declined vs earlier periods (P1-2 high; P3-7 lower). Set L by calculated observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5, P3-P7) to capture the new lower-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower target base stock to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg demand prior (P1-P2)=252 -> recent (P3-P7)=151.8 (-39.7%)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3 (periods 3\u20138 average demand lower). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by repeated 0-period arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (regime from Period 3\u20138 has 6 samples), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent lower-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while preserving service. This balances the high profit ($19) with low holding cost ($1) given the sustained drop in demand and zero pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=123, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-9 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand regime shift previously detected at Period 3: recent regime (Periods 3-7) shows lower mean; use recent_N to focus forecast on the most recent stable regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the lower recent demand while accounting for observed low lead time and avoiding excess holding given holding cost >> profit trade-off.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=152, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 3 (carry-over noted: P3-P7 avg ~151.8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because arrivals have been reliable. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 3\u201310) to capture the lower post-change regime and avoid bias from the two high early samples; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward higher service (profit/holding implies high target service level) while grounding mean/variance on the confirmed lower-demand regime, reducing excess inventory risk given current on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=156, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3 (lower mean). To reflect the post-shift demand, set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) and use recent_N for demand and volatility using the recent regime. I choose N=9 (Periods 3-11) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime while meeting the N bounds. This biases the base-stock toward the lower recent mean, reducing overstock risk given holding cost, while sigma from recent data captures current variability for service-level calculation.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=131, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm lead time=0 (Periods 1-12 arrivals matched orders). Demand regime shift noted previously at Period 3 with lower demand since then; recent realized weekly demands (P3-P12) are lower and less volatile than the initial two weeks. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) since arrivals have been reliable. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the post-changepoint regime (Period 3\u201312, regime length=10) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the lower recent mean and volatility; this keeps the OR base-stock conservative versus older high-demand samples and avoids excess holding given low holding cost sensitivity. No shipments appear overdue.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a prior demand regime shift was already recorded; no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in recent periods. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding needless extra stock given ample on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=178, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P15). Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 54,78,52,61,49; mean=58.8) is substantially lower than earlier regime, so I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the current lower-demand regime. I choose N=5 (covers last 5 periods, within the 3\u201320 rule) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current demand level while avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory and no pipeline. L kept as default (promised lead time = 0).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand 140, in-transit 0. Recent demand has settled lower vs early periods (sustained lower weekly sales since Period 3). No evidence of lead-time shifts (carry-over earlier confirmed lead time = 0). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates based on the last 5 weeks (Periods 12-16) which captures the current demand level (~55.6 units/week) and recent variability. I keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. This produces a base_stock aligned to current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given $1 holding vs $19 profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time and set demand forecast and volatility using recent data covering the current low-demand regime (most recent 15 periods since the shift) so the base-stock reflects reduced demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent realized demand has fallen sharply: last four period demands = [49,38,29,14] (P15-P18). On-hand=171, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand now but demand appears to have entered a new low regime, and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised = 0). To capture the recent sustained drop I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most recent low-demand regime, reducing replenishment and holding cost while maintaining service. This balances high profit per unit with much lower demand and current ample on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand P9-P14 = 61.5 -> recent P15-P18 = 32.5 (-47.2%)

Lead time historically confirmed as 0. To align the base-stock forecast with the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=5 (captures the last 5 periods) and keep L as default (promised 0). This keeps target inventory responsive to the reduced demand and limits holding cost drag.

To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set L to observed average lead time; forecast demand using recent regime (Periods 15-20) to capture sustained lower demand. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant 6 samples, reducing excess inventory build-up given low demand and low holding cost trade-off.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm the observed lead time=0 from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (periods 15\u201321) so mu_hat reflects the new low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture current volatility; this reduces overstock risk while preserving service during the lower-demand regime.

To avoid excess holding while meeting high service target implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95), use a short-window recent demand estimate so base-stock follows the new low demand regime. Set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed low-demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time=0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15 (P15-P24 = 10 periods, avg ~32.5 then continued low recent weeks). To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and low holding cost, use lead time = default (promised 0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent regime: recent_N with N=10 (covers P15\u2013P24). These params let the OR backend size base stock to recent lower demand while keeping safety stock for observed variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1-P18 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has declined since earlier periods (carry-over notes record regime shifts at P3 and P15). No new sustained changepoint in recent periods (demand since P15\u2013P25 remains low and variable but already captured). Given confirmed lead time=0 and no new regime to record, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95) by letting the OR compute a high service-level base stock while leveraging the observed lower demand regime previously recorded. No special adjustment for missing shipments is needed because arrivals historically match promised lead time=0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=212, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 15 (recent avg ~32.5); using recent demand will avoid over-ordering given current high on-hand. Set L to promised (default 0). Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime across Periods 15-26. This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and volatility input to the OR engine, letting it lower orders while the backend's high target service level (profit/ (profit+holding)) preserves service performance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 15 (many weeks with demand in the teens-to-60s). On-hand=51, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals or lost-shipment signal. Past concluded messages (Periods 1-29) consistently show lead time = 0; no evidence to change. I therefore keep L = default (promised 0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime since P15, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent regime: use recent_N with N=15 (captures Period 15\u201329 demand history) so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, reducing target base-stock and caps to avoid excessive holding given low demand. This balances high profit (encourages service) vs low holding cost by shrinking forecast to the confirmed low-demand regime.

Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 43,58,63,40,92; mean=59.2) is representative of the current low-demand regime observed since Period 15. Use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimate from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current regime while keeping safety stock moderate given high profit/hiding cost ratio (q\u22480.95) handled by the OR backend.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised=0). Demand shows a clear, sustained uptick starting Period 26 (P26-P31 average \u224868.7 vs prior P15-P25 avg \u224824.5). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (periods 26-31) to capture the new higher-demand regime and its volatility; this raises the backend base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while the short lead time limits pipeline risk. Using recent data avoids over-weighting older low-demand periods and balances service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg prior P15-P25 = 24.5 -> recent P26-P31 = 68.7 (+180%)

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a demand regime shift starting at Period 26 (carry-over: P26-P31 avg=68.7, regime length=6) with elevated weekly demand including two recent 116 sales (P30-31). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To cover the (1+L) review+lead period while reflecting the recent higher-demand regime, set L=default (use promised lead time=0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to base the forecast on the P26-P31 regime (N = regime_length = 6). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters bias orders toward the recent higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed zero lead time to avoid excess safety for hidden delays.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0; latest demand (P33=319) is a large spike but not yet a sustained regime (only one extreme week). To balance service vs holding cost I use the confirmed promised lead time (default) and short recent-window forecasts to react quickly to the recent uptick while limiting inventory risk. I choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand mix (including the spike) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises target stock moderately but keeps cap constraints in place.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time=0 (consistent arrivals P1..P34). Recent demand has shifted upward starting Period 26 (P26-P34 recent mean \u2248124.3, high volatility including P33=319,P34=272). I set L to default (promised 0) because conclude history repeatedly confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime (N=9 = length of the recent regime P26-P34). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=9) captures the elevated variability in the same window. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping holding exposure tied to observed volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 26 (P26-P35 demand series: 43,58,63,40,92,116,116,134,272,315). Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). To capture the recent demand spike I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (the recent regime length = 10 weeks P26-P35). This focuses the OR backend forecast on the new higher mean and volatility so base_stock will increase to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the capped order cap limits excessive single-period orders, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed many periods). Demand has moved to a higher regime starting around Period 32 (P33-P36 demand: 319,272,315,275). To react quickly to this sustained uptick while avoiding stockouts given 0 LT, use default lead time (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 4 high-demand weeks (captures current regime). This raises base_stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand reflecting the recent spike, improving service rate while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 33 (demands P33-P37 = 319,272,315,275,345; mean=305.2, std\u224831.2). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments; historical lead time confirmed 0. To restore service and capture profit during this high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the elevated mean (\u2248305 units/week). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture current volatility (~31). Keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1-P38). Recent demand has risen sharply starting around Period 32 (weeks P32-P38 demand: 116,319,272,315,275,345,410) \u2014 a sustained high-demand regime of length 7. I set L to default (promised = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime and higher volatility; this will raise the base stock and the cap appropriately to prevent stockouts while accepting increased holding cost given high profit ($19 vs $1).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Recent periods (P33-P39) show a sustained, large uplift in demand (multi-week spikes) versus earlier regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime length (7 weeks: P33-P39) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock and accounts for increased variability while backend caps orders. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the spike) versus holding cost by focusing the forecast on the confirmed high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg prior (P26-P32)=75.4 -> recent (P33-P39)=328.7 (+336%)

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime beginning Period 33 (avg ~329/week; Period 40 demand=392) \u2014 demand remains elevated. To cover current period plus review+lead, use promised lead time (L default=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 33\u201340, length=8) so the OR engine targets the elevated demand and limits stockouts while keeping holding cost sensitivity via backend service-level cap.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead-time history consistently shows 0 (confirmed P1\u2192P1 ... P41\u2192P41), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting at Period 33 (carry-over shows P33+ large spike). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent 9 weeks (P33\u2013P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat; N=9 is chosen because the high-demand regime length is ~9 periods and meets the recent_N rules (3\u2264N\u226420). This raises the backend base_stock to cover the elevated (1+L)-period demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent volatility, balancing service level (high profit/low shortage cost) against holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirms P1\u2192P42). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 33 (P33\u2013P42 shows much higher weekly demand including very large Nov weeks). To capture the recent high-demand regime (holiday surge) and because there is no pipeline, use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent regime. Set L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time, mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 (covering Period 33\u201342 recent high-demand regime), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This biases the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand period while the OR backend will cap orders by its cap rule.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=298, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained arrivals same-period). Demand shows a sustained high regime beginning at Period 33 (carry-over insight: +336% recent increase). To capture the recent elevated demand (holiday season Nov), set L=default (promised 0). For demand level and volatility I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Period 33 onward). Regime length = 11 periods (P33\u2013P43), so choose N=11 to focus the forecast on the elevated recent demand and increase safety stock for high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1). This raises mu_hat and sigma_hat to reduce stockouts during the holiday spike while keeping holding costs manageable given high margin.

Sigma likewise recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. This raises base-stock to protect against stockouts during the holiday surge while limiting excess holding cost by restricting the sample window to the current high regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 33 (large spike through Periods 33-45). On-hand=133, in-transit=0 so we must rely on forecast to cover (1+L) periods. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals at lead_time=0); no evidence of lost shipments. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (periods 33\u201345 length=13) so the OR backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the current elevated mean and volatility. L uses default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0. This balances service (raise base-stock to match recent high demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than all-sample averages.

LLM Rationale:

To let the OR engine use full sample history and already-confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances maintaining service through the holiday spike while letting the optimizer cap orders versus holding cost.
