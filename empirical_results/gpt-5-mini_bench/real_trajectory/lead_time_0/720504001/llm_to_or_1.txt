Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 720504001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Historical weekly samples (5): [33,41,28,20,52] \u2014 no recent concluded arrivals to infer lead time changes and no sustained regime shift (only 5 weeks). Promised lead time is 0; with no evidence of delays or losses I keep L at default. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited data and modest holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit). No explicit inflation of demand or variance is warranted.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples include historical weeks (33,41,28,20,52) plus Period1 demand=49; on-hand=6, in-transit=0 so inventory is low versus observed weekly demand (~35). Promised lead time=0 and Period1 order arrived in Period1 (evidence of same-day arrival). To let the OR backend compute demand across review+lead using full-sample statistics and the promised lead time, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This yields (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples so the base-stock balances service level (using profit/holding ratio) against holding cost while acknowledging current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demand (P1=49, P2=54) is well above older historical mean (~34.8) but only two high periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=4, in-transit=0, so risk of stockouts is real this period. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in prior periods. For demand forecast use EWMA to weight recent high demand without prematurely committing to a permanent higher mean (EWMA_gamma=0.5). Keep sigma at default because variance change is not yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $629.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Recent demands: P1=49, P2=54, P3=35. All three concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). To reflect confirmed lead time use calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Demand appears most informative in the last 3 periods (small sample but shows current regime), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast and volatility on the recent pattern. This keeps target stock responsive while avoiding overstating uncertainty; with L=0 this covers the current period demand directly and limits holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Recent concluded periods show orders always arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Historical sample mean demand = 34.8 units/week (samples: 33,41,28,20,52). With confirmed L=0 I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service (mean demand ~35) against low holding cost and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P5 arrived same period) so I set L based on observed lead times. Demand has declined from early-period highs (49,54) to a lower recent regime (last 3 demands = 35,24,22, avg\u224827). To be responsive to this recent lower demand while keeping service, I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent regime). This reduces target base-stock vs longer-horizon averages, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-6) = [49,54,35,24,22,34]; on-hand=5, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To keep service with low holding cost, use promised lead time (default 0) and base demand forecast on the most recent 6 periods to capture the current regime while keeping variance estimate aligned with recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand has averaged higher than the small 5-sample Jan-Feb series; last 7 concluded periods show demands = [49,54,35,24,22,34,30] with mean ~35. On-hand=28, in-transit=0 and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (orders arrive same period). To match recent regime and avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost low, set L to default (promised=0) but use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and caps reflect the latest demand level and volatility. This balances service (using recent demand) versus holding cost (keeping L=0 and using only 7-period window).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and current on-hand=1, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift: weekly demands since Period1 vary but show no sustained change. I set L using calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples (stable demand) to compute base-stock and safety stock, balancing profit vs holding cost while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). I choose default lead time to reflect promised 0 and confirmed behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend captures long-run demand mean/variance; with profit $19 and holding $1 the backend will target a high service level automatically.

Given consistent zero lead time and stable demand, set lead time method to calculate (backend will confirm average observed LT=0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost while relying on observed LT=0.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=4, in-transit=0, recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in prior carry-over). No overdue shipments. Demand history (Periods 1-14) appears stationary around prior samples; therefore use promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR backend can compute base-stock and caps. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised lead time (0); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample demand mean/variance) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

To let the OR engine use full-history demand stats and the confirmed promised lead time, I use default lead time and default demand mean/volatility so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history (Periods 1\u201316) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and weekly demand variability around the historical average. On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand plus safety. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded periods confirm 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full historical demand sample set and lets the backend set base-stock and cap balancing profit ($19) vs holding ($1). Using defaults keeps parameters stable given no new sustained demand regime change.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2014 use calculated lead time. Recent demand (Periods 13-17 = 24,51,36,48,53) shows a clear upward regime vs the early-sample mean; I use the recent 5 weeks to capture the current higher demand when forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat over review+lead). This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given low on-hand and zero pipeline while keeping volatility measured from the same recent window.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (last 5 demands: P14-18 = 51,36,48,53,36; mean=44.8). On-hand=27, in-transit=0 and confirmed lead time=0 historically. To target service while controlling holding cost I use L=default (promised 0, confirmed), mu_hat based on recent_N=5 to capture the current higher mean, and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability for safety stock sizing.

Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed) and weekly demand ranging roughly mid-20s to mid-50s with current on-hand=31 and in-transit=0. No overdue shipments. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: this leverages the confirmed 0-period lead time and historical demand to set base-stock while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise.

Recent demands (Periods 1-20) show no sustained regime shift requiring a different forecast. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1. This keeps orders responsive to observed weekly demand while avoiding unnecessary inventory given current on-hand stock.

Current on-hand=39, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Profit/Holding => target service level q=19/(19+1)=0.95 so z*\u22481.645. Use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by past concludes).

No recent demand regime change detected; use defaults so backend computes base stock from full-sample mean and std with promised lead time=0. This keeps orders aligned with observed zero lead time and high service requirement while avoiding manual bias.

Historical conclude messages through Period 23 consistently show orders arriving same period (lead time observed=0 in multiple periods), and no lost shipments. Demand history through Period 23 shows no sustained regime shift (weekly demand fluctuates but centers around prior sample means). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations and a 0-period delivery reality, use default lead time and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample average) with holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 across many periods), so use default lead time. Demand history appears stable without recent regime shifts; use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with long-run demand and leverages the confirmed 0 lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline build-up and extra holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 across many periods) and no evidence of lost shipments. Demand history is stable with weekly demand typically in the 20\u201355 range. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no sustained regime change, use default estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances high implied service target (profit/total \u22480.95) with holding cost by letting the backend compute the appropriate base stock and cap.

To keep the OR engine aligned with observed system behavior and avoid unnecessary pipeline buildup, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (uses full-sample mean) against holding cost given current modest on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 30 showed a one-week spike (demand=90, sold=55) causing stockout. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-30) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0. No sustained demand regime shift (variability but no 3+ period change). I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR engine uses full history to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, allowing it to set base-stock and safety-stock given the high profit/holding ratio and recent stockout. This keeps parameters conservative to recover service levels while avoiding excess holding.

Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201331) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent two periods show demand spikes (90,101) but not a sustained regime (needs \u22653 periods) so do not alter demand estimates. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance, balancing high profit (q\u22480.95) with low holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent weeks show a clear upward demand regime: Periods 30-32 demands = [90,101,70] with stockouts each week. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in carry-over. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, keep L as default (promised 0) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime. I choose recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility from the last 3 periods (the new regime), so the OR engine will raise the base-stock to meet the current higher demand pattern and the capped order will limit extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased from ~34 (Periods 1-29) to 87 (Periods 30-32), +~156%; sustained for 3 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (demands: P30=90, P31=101, P32=70, P33=151). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. To respond to the higher recent demand, keep L at promised (default) and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 30-33) so the OR engine raises the base stock to cover the new higher demand while limiting excess inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand regime change detected starting Period 30: weekly demand jumped from ~34 (P1-29) to much higher values (P30-34: 90,101,70,151,93). On-hand=67, in-transit=0; with lead time confirmed as 0 historically, arrivals are same-period. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent history. Set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 5 high-demand samples (Periods 30-34). This raises the base stock to cover the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind because holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (P30-35 mean \u2248 99.8 vs \u224834 earlier). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in carry-over). To capture the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the six most recent periods (P30\u2013P35). This raises target base-stock to serve the elevated demand while the recent_N sigma better sizes safety stock; using recent data avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand samples and balances service level against holding cost given high profit:holding ratio (q\u22480.95).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Demand increased at Period 30 and has stayed elevated for 7 periods (Period 30-36 mean \u224896.7). I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by history). I use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new higher-demand regime using the last 7 periods (regime length=7). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine size base-stock and safety stock around the new demand mean/volatility, balancing service (high profit $19) against holding cost $1.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (periods 30-37 mean \u224898.5 units/week vs ~34 earlier) and confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in prior concludes). On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; given high recent demand and zero lead time, set lead time to use promised (default) and set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (last 8 periods) so OR backend targets service with moderated holding cost. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=8 (periods 30-37) to reflect the new regime while keeping L default.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals matched same-period orders repeatedly) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (higher weekly demand since then). Current on-hand = 31, in-transit = 0; pipeline is empty so we must cover current period demand plus lead-time exposure (L+1 periods). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) since conclude messages consistently confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201338) rather than diluting with older low-demand data; this produces mu_hat reflecting (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 9 samples. I also use recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias orders toward the elevated demand observed since Period 30, reducing expected stockouts while keeping holding exposure tied to observed variance.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (concluded arrivals each period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 30 (higher mean since P30); therefore I use recent data from the post-shift regime to set demand parameters. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 30-39) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this biases orders upward to avoid costly stockouts given Profit=$19 >> Holding=$1 while keeping holding growth controlled by using recent regime stats.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time = 0 (confirmed P1-P40 concludes). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 30 (periods 30-40 show much higher weekly sales). I keep L at promised (default=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. To capture the higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 30-40) so the base-stock reflects the new mean; I match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the elevated regime) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory but zero pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (avg rose from ~34 to ~87) and lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P41). On-hand=44, in-transit=0; recent high-demand regime length = 12 periods (P30\u2013P41). I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast and variability on the post-changepoint regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 12 samples). This raises target base-stock to match the higher demand while limiting influence of earlier low-demand periods, balancing service-level (avoid stockouts during the new high demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P42) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (Periods 30\u201342 demand substantially higher than Periods 1\u201329). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N on demand statistics covering the post-change regime (Periods 30\u201342). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. Using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the higher mean and volatility observed since the changepoint, increasing service while controlling holding costs. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9. On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained regime increase starting Period 30; recent periods (P30\u2013P43) are the relevant regime. To capture the post-change demand, set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 14 samples (regime length from P30\u2013P43 = 14). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while keeping variability grounded in recent observations; high profit vs. holding cost (q\u22480.95) implies a high service target, so using recent regime stats helps avoid stockouts without unnecessary long-term overstock given current on-hand=97.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (demand jumped ~+156% and persisted). On-hand=64, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and observed lead time has been 0 consistently. To capture the post-change demand level I use recent_N over the post-change regime (Periods 30\u201344, length=15) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the new regime. I keep L=default because concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Using recent_N (N=15) tightens the base-stock to current demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent variability, balancing service (avoid stockouts in high regime) against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 30 (much higher demand since). On-hand=28, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historically confirmed actual L=0. To capture the post-shift demand level I use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201345, regime length=16). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat toward the higher recent mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to avoid stockouts while L=default keeps arrivals same-period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 0 across many periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (mean rose from ~34 to ~87). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms actual 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 30\u201346 constitute a sustained high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 17 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility.
