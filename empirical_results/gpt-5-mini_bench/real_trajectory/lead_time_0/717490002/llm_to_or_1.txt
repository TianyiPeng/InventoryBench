Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Demand history (weekly): [42,40,35,42,38], mean=39.4; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Promised lead time used (default) and historical-sample-based demand/volatility kept (default) because no sustained changepoint or shipment evidence exists. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock anchored to observed mean while avoiding premature adjustments for lead time or demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows ordered=40 arrived=40 (lead_time=0) \u2014 confirms actual lead time = promised 0. Historical weekly demand samples (42,40,35,42,38) yield mean ~39.4 and moderate variability; no recent changepoint or seasonal signal detected. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded history shows two on-time arrivals with observed lead_times = 0 (P1 and P2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand was 32 then 51; historical weekly mean (provided samples) ~39.4. I choose L by calculating average observed lead time (keeps promised 0 since evidence =0). For demand and volatility I use default (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) to anchor forecasts to the provided historical weekly series while avoiding overreacting to a single high week. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding, relying on base-stock computed from long-run mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Observed concluded lead times from Periods 1-3 are all 0, so use calculated lead time (avg observed = 0). Recent realized demand (concluded) shows higher values in Periods 2-3 (51,61) versus historical Jan samples (mean ~39.4); to react to this potential upward shift, set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (captures demands 32,51,61). Use sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to better cover near-term demand while keeping holding cost awareness via recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Historical baseline (Jan samples) mean \u224839.4/wk, but Periods 2-4 show sustained higher demand (51,61,47) \u2014 recent average 53/wk (+34%). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I therefore keep L at promised (default=0) but set demand estimates using the recent 3-week regime to capture the higher mean and elevated volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given equal profit/holding. Methods: L=default; mu_hat=recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new demand level; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: prior mean=39.4 (2019-01 samples), recent mean Periods 2-4=53 (+34%); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 for all arrivals (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical demand since Period 2 elevated vs earlier (carry-over noted). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to target the most recent elevated demand regime (Periods 2-5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and raises target stock to reduce stockouts. I match sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect current volatility in that same recent regime. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by restricting adaptation to the sustained recent regime rather than all older low-demand samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime since Period 2; latest demands (Periods 2-6) = [51,61,47,44,84], mean \u224857.4, clearly above the historical Jan mean \u224839.4. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded arrivals show 0. Set demand forecast using recent 5 weeks to capture the new regime (reduces dilution from older low-Jan samples). Use recent 5-week std for volatility so the OR backend sizes safety stock to cover recent variability (including the spike to 84). These parameters balance higher service needs from the regime shift against holding cost by grounding forecasts in the most relevant recent data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20137) show lead_time=0 consistently. Demand has been higher recently (Period demands: 32,51,61,47,44,84,150) with a clear uptick since Period 2 and large spikes in Periods 6\u20137. To reflect the observed zero actual lead time, I let the backend calculate L from observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N=5 window to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 3\u20137) which captures the recent uplift while avoiding overreacting to a two-period extreme spike; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need to cover current period demand after decision. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so keep inferred lead time = 0. Demand has shifted up starting Period 2 and the higher-demand regime persists through Period 8 (Periods 2-8 = 7 periods); use recent data from that regime to avoid dilution by the earlier low-Jan samples. Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 2-8) so the base-stock and cap reflect the sustained higher mean and variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). No overdue shipments detected.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all orders arriving with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20139). Recent demand has stepped up sharply: Periods 6\u20139 demands = 84,150,118,64 (mean=104). To meet elevated demand while avoiding stockouts given same-period arrivals, keep promised lead time (default). Forecast demand using the most recent sustained regime (last 4 periods) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; likewise use recent volatility for sigma_hat. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the new high-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: recent avg (P6\u2013P9)=104 vs prior ~53 (P2\u2013P5) (+96%); sustained for 4 periods

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. To prioritize service in this new regime while limiting holding cost, set lead time by observed average, and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods (captures the high-demand regime). Sigma also from last 5 to reflect current volatility. This yields L=calculate, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand increased starting Period 6 and has been sustained (P6\u2013P11 demand samples: 84,150,118,64,66,76; recent mean \u224893). I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (regime P6\u2013P11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent mean/volatility; this biases orders toward the higher recent demand while keeping holding costs in mind given profit=holding ($1/$1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period, so keep L as promised (default). Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (P6\u2013P12 demand elevated vs earlier periods); to capture the current higher mean/volatility I use recent_N over the recent regime (Periods 6\u201312, 7 samples). This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated demand and limits stockouts while letting the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 (orders placed P1\u2013P13 all arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201313 = 84,150,118,64,66,76,76,39) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier Jan samples; I capture this by using recent_N over the most recent 8 periods to forecast (covers the identified regime). L uses promised/default lead time (0) consistent with all concluded evidence. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by increasing target base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand while keeping lead time at 0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so set L to the calculated average lead time (0). Demand has shown multiple regime shifts earlier; recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P10\u2013P14 = 66,76,76,39,54) averages ~62.2 with noticeable volatility. To capture the current regime and recent volatility, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases orders on the most recent demand behavior while keeping lead-time at the observed average. This balances service level (catching recent higher demand) against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 0-period actual lead time. Recent demand has been elevated vs early 2019 but shows some variability; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201315) = [76,76,39,54,63], mean \u224861.6. I choose promised/default lead time to reflect consistent observed 0 LT, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current demand regime and accounts for recent volatility while avoiding stale early-sample dilution. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) vs holding cost given zero starting inventory and no pipeline.

Demand recent five periods (P12\u2013P16): 76, 39, 54, 63, 108 \u2192 mean=68. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the latest regime (captures recent volatility including P16 spike). sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility across (1+L). These choices prioritize service (profit=holding cost) by using a short lead time and a recent mean to cover current demand while letting OR backend compute safety stock via q-based z*.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I choose L=default to respect promised lead time (0) and because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. To keep service during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 (Periods 10\u201317) so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the current higher mean and observed volatility rather than older low-demand weeks.

Recent demand has stabilized at a higher level; last 5 demands (P14\u2013P18) = [54,63,108,84,72], mean \u224876.2. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime while keeping variability responsive; this balances service (avoid stockouts) versus holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand increased sharply around Period 6 and has remained at a higher regime through Period 19 (sustained). To capture the elevated recent mean/volatility I use recent_N over the current high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201319, N=14). L kept at default (promised=0) since observed lead time=0 historically. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand, improving service while accepting holding cost tradeoff given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). History shows consistent same-period arrivals (concluded lead_time=0 for all past orders) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6. On-hand and in-transit are 0. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from concluded history (will be 0). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (captures long-run demand including recent high regime) and lets the capped policy limit orders versus inventory/pipeline. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand: P17\u2013P20 = [84,72,100,105] (avg ~90); P21 had a one-off spike to 393 (not sustained). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 (periods 17\u201320) to capture the most recent sustained regime (~90 mean) while excluding the isolated P21 outlier. This balances service (covers current higher baseline) versus holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent sustained regime rather than the single anomalous spike.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has materially increased since Period 16 (P16\u2013P22 mean \u2248160.9 vs prior P2\u2013P15 mean \u224870.9, +126%). I keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded history shows 0 actual lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and volatile short-run behavior I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent weeks including the large spikes at P21\u2013P22) so the OR backend targets a larger base stock while sigma_hat recent_N reflects elevated variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting the window to the most recent 5 weeks rather than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg P16\u2013P22=160.86 vs prior P2\u2013P15=70.93 (+126%), sustained for 7 periods

A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 16 (P16\u2013P23 avg\u2248160.9 vs prior \u224870.9) \u2014 use that regime to forecast. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (regime P16\u2013P23 length=8) so the OR backend targets the elevated demand regime while limiting excess holding (profit=holding -> service quantile=0.5, so base stock centers on mu_hat).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 21\u201324) shows a new high-variance regime with demands [393,264,74,128]; last 4-week average (~214) is materially above older regimes, so I rely on recent samples to set forecast and volatility. Chosen L=default keeps OR engine's lead-time assumption at 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=4) to make the base stock responsive to the current elevated/variable demand while avoiding overcommitment from older low-demand data. This balances service level (capture recent spikes) against holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 21 (large spikes P21\u2013P25, and P26 demand=227 causing stockout). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so need to size orders to recent elevated demand. Lead time history (concluded arrivals) consistently shows 0 periods, so keep L as default (promised=0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest high-demand regime (Periods 22\u201326) and for volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings steer the OR backend to target safety stock appropriate for the new regime while avoiding using long-ago low-demand data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand regimes have shifted upward in prior insight (noted sustained regime from Period 16 onward). Recent demand (Periods 16\u201327) is elevated and more variable; to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent samples rather than the full history. Set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded lead times = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 16\u201327, the confirmed higher-demand regime length) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant regime. This balances service (matching elevated recent demand) against holding costs by avoiding dilution with older low-demand data.

Recent demand has been volatile but earlier carry-over insights already recorded sustained regime shifts through Period 23; I see no new sustained changepoint in the last 3+ periods. Use promised lead time (default) so the OR backend uses L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given no new confirmed regime changes and full historical sample set.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Multiple sustained demand regime shifts documented up to Period 23 with a high-demand regime continuing through recent periods (P16\u2013P29). To capture the current high-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N=14 for demand estimate and volatility (covers the most recent sustained regime length ~P16\u2013P29). This biases the OR base-stock toward recent higher demand, improving service while keeping holding risk explicit to the backend via sigma_hat.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand remains at elevated regime since earlier periods (carry-over shows sustained shifts up to Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current demand. Use L default (promised 0; historical concluded lead times all 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (periods 26\u201330: demands = 227,91,82,193,223; recent mean ~163) so mu_hat reflects current demand level without diluting by older low-season samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture volatility in these recent samples. These settings push the OR engine to target a higher base stock appropriate for the sustained elevated demand while keeping variability estimate tied to the most relevant recent observations.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand regime since Period 16 is substantially higher and sustained; to capture the elevated demand I use a recent-sample forecast. L: use calculated average lead time from concluded history (0) to reflect consistent same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=16 (Period16\u2013Period31) to set (1+L)\xd7mean aligned to the current high-demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=16 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base_stock from the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability; with profit=holding, this balances fill rate vs. holding cost given zero observed lead time and no overdue shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 periods; recent demand remains in the higher regime established around Period 16 (sustained). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed arrivals always W=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent demands: P28\u2013P32 = 82,193,223,135,103; recent mean ~147) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same window. These choices bias the base stock toward current high demand while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed rapid arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent periods (P21-P33) show elevated and volatile demand vs early 2019; however shifts have already been recorded in carry-over insights. With no new sustained changepoint detected and zero pipeline, choose default methods so the OR backend uses full-sample estimates ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost. This will produce the base_stock and capped order consistent with the backend model while accounting for observed zero lead time behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (no evidence of delay), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand since the large mid-year uplift remains higher than early-year baseline; to reflect the current elevated regime without over-weighting older low-demand samples, I use a recent-window estimate. I choose recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand samples cover Periods 27\u201334) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This produces (1+L)-scaled demand forecast focused on the recent elevated demand and a corresponding volatility to balance service level versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has had multiple sustained regime shifts earlier (captured in carry-over) but no new sustained change in the most recent weeks; however recent weekly demand is higher and more volatile than long-run early samples, so I use recent_N (last 8 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand and variance while letting the backend compute base-stock and caps.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been volatile with multiple sustained regime shifts earlier in the year; most recent concluded periods (P30\u2013P36) show elevated weekly demand but arrivals/lead times have consistently been observed as 0. On-hand=98, in-transit=0 so pipeline visible to decision is zero. I keep L at default (promised 0) because concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 persistently. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level using full-sample statistics while relying on observed zero lead time. No explicit upward/downward adjustments now to avoid overfitting short recent swings given existing multi-period regime records.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier summer spikes; last 5 concluded demands (P33\u2013P37)=172,93,58,35,57 (mean=83) which better represents the near-term demand environment than the long-run average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to adapt to this lower recent regime while keeping sigma_hat default to reflect overall observed volatility. This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand stock and no pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has softened from earlier peaks; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201338) = [58, 35, 57, 53], avg \u2248 50.75. I detect a short, sustained lower-demand regime over these 4 weeks and therefore forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using recent_N (N=4). Volatility is estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=4). These settings keep target stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent observed demand has cooled from summer peaks; last 5 concluded demands (P35\u2013P39) = [58,35,57,53,37], mean \u224848. On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so we are lightly stocked. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0, so use default L. To avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), use a short-run forecast based on the most recent regime: set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current lower demand and reduce overstock risk. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent variability. These parameters bias orders toward recent demand levels, balancing service vs. holding given matched profit/holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 repeatedly (orders in history show lead_time=0). Recent demand has moderated from earlier peaks; last 8 concluded demands (P33\u2013P40) average ~70.25/week. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (supported by many concluded observations). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent post-peak demand regime while smoothing older extreme spikes. sigma_hat set to default to provide the backend with full-sample volatility for safety given regime variability. With q=0.5 (profit=holding), base-stock equals the mu_hat forecast; using recent demand for mu_hat balances service vs holding cost given zero pipeline and current stockout risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows multiple past demand regime shifts (notably P16\u2013P22) but no new sustained change in the conclude messages since the last recorded insight. All concluded lead times are 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Given confirmed historical lead_time=0 and no fresh changepoint, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples; this balances service vs holding cost without overfitting to transient recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use default promised L. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201342) shows elevated and volatile demand vs earlier months; I choose recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast to the most recent regime (mean \u224873 units) and recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while using L=default to match observed lead times.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed previously always arrived same period). Recent demand has variability but no new sustained regime shift since the last recorded insight; December may have holiday effects but current short-run history (P41\u2013P43) is mixed. To let the OR backend use full historical stats and the promised lead time, I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost using the backend's calibrated z* and cap while avoiding overreacting to short noisy swings.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across all periods (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent weeks (P43\u2013P44) show low demand but only 2 periods\u2014no sustained changepoint. To avoid overfitting short blips and because profit=holding ($1) implies neutral service/holding tradeoff, use default demand statistics (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)*full-sample std.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0 throughout\u2014use default lead time. To avoid overfitting to recent high-variance weeks around mid-November/July spikes, use default demand estimates derived from the full sample history so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps target base-stock anchored to long-run demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and current moderate on-hand inventory, while avoiding aggressive replenishment into the year-end period with uncertain short-term demand.

Recent weeks show typical post-peak fluctuations (one large spike at P42) but no new sustained demand regime change. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the long-run sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service vs. holding given stable historical patterns.
