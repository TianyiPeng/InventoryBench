Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks): [78,58,47,42,40] showing a downward trend but limited data\u2014no sustained regime change (needs 3+ periods confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current review+lead period. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine compute a base-stock balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean = 53 units/week. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed arrived with lead_time=0 (ordered=53, arrived=53). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, so available coverage is low and matches recent mean. I set L using calculated observed lead times to reflect the single confirmed observation of 0 periods. I use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend produces a base-stock near the historical mean (1+L)*53 to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.5 -> moderate service level). This keeps target inventory close to recent demand while letting the backend cap limit peak orders.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed arrivals in Periods 1-2 show actual lead_time=0 (orders placed P1/P2 arrived same period). Demand history includes baseline weekly samples [78,58,47,42,40] plus recent demands 48 (P1) and 120 (P2). The single large spike (120) is not yet a sustained regime shift (requires \u22653 periods); no shipments appear lost and promised lead_time=0 is supported. I therefore set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (0) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical mean/variance ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (no confirmed sustained demand increase) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand has been elevated and volatile (Periods 1-3 demands = 48, 120, 77). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period. Observed concluded lead times for three consecutive periods are 0, so set L by calculating average observed lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime while remaining responsive to volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (N=3). These parameters give the OR engine a replenishment target reflecting current demand levels and confirmed same-period arrivals, balancing service and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) shows a new, more volatile regime (48,120,77,39) vs older Jan samples; on-hand=43, in-transit=0, confirmed lead time=0 from Period 4 conclude. Use promised lead time (default=0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current regime (mean \u224871) and set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover current higher mean) while avoiding excess inventory given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand (last 5 periods) = [48,120,77,39,55] showing higher mean and elevated variability vs earlier Jan samples; on-hand=16, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time observed=0 historically). Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (spike and volatility) so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand (Periods 2-6) shows elevated and volatile weekly demand after initial samples; lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 2-6) where mean and variability changed; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by updating forecasts to recent demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demands (Periods 1-7 concluded) show a clear regime shift upward vs. the old Jan samples (concluded demands: 48,120,77,39,55,47,83). Promised and observed lead time is 0 (confirmed in history). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand moments with N=7 (all available recent periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 7 demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 7 demands). This keeps orders responsive to the new demand level while respecting the OR backend cap. L left as default (promised 0) since concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time and no lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized weekly demand has been volatile but elevated versus the Jan samples; last 5 concluded demands = [39,55,47,83,55] (mean ~55.8). On-hand=12, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in prior periods. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use a short recent-window forecast (most recent 5 weeks) with L=default (promised 0). This yields mu_hat based on recent_N=5 to capture current regime; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=28, in-transit=0; recent demands are volatile (28\u2013120) but no sustained upward regime shift\u2014use conservative default estimators. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (and confirmed by concluded arrivals). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine set base-stock and cap balancing the 50% service/holding tradeoff given profit=holding. This keeps parameters simple, leverages full sample history, and avoids overfitting to recent high variance weeks while on-hand stock is moderate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

I therefore set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, providing a stable baseline given no sustained demand regime change and no lost shipments. This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) with holding cost while acknowledging current low pipeline (0) and modest on-hand (16).

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand over last 11 concluded periods is stable (samples: 48,120,77,39,55,47,83,55,28,43,41) with no sustained regime shift; I use recent_N=11 to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. L kept as promised (0) to match observed arrivals and keep orders same-period. These parameters give the OR backend a forecast that balances service (using recent observed mean) against holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in Period 4). Demand history (samples mean \u224853) and recent weeks show no sustained regime shift. To keep policy simple and stable I use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows every order arriving same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0) so I trust promised lead time=0. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand (concluded) has varied but shows no sustained upward regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) I use defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std with L=promised (0). This avoids overfitting short swings while reflecting the confirmed zero lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate (L+1)=1 period of demand. Historical concluded lead times confirm same-period arrival; use promised/default L=0. Use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to emphasize recent demand while smoothing the P14 spike (keeps target base-stock responsive but not over-reactive). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current demand volatility from the most recent 5 weeks. These choices keep base-stock focused on recent demand and limit excess holding given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show recent variability with several high-demand weeks (Periods 14-15: 67,87) but the most recent 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 11-15: 41,41,31,67,87) form the best short-run estimate for the review+lead demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in prior concludes. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent regime including the recent spikes while limiting noise from older winter samples. For variability I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current observed volatility. These choices give the OR backend an up-to-date mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window and keep orders responsive to recent demand spikes while avoiding over-weighting distant historical winter data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 12-16) = [41,31,67,87,51] shows higher mean (~55) and elevated volatility vs earlier Jan samples; no evidence shipments are delayed (lead time confirmed 0 in history). To cover the immediate (L+1) period and reflect the recent demand regime, set L to promised (0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current demand levels while accounting for recent variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost (avoid overstocking from older, higher historical means).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand history is stable around mean ~53/week (historical sample mean from Jan data =53). Given confirmed L=0 and no evidence of a sustained demand regime change, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters conservative, leveraging full-sample estimates and the confirmed same-period lead time to balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1-18) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand history shows variable weekly demand but no sustained regime shift requiring deviation from historical sample-based estimates. I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full sample mean/std; this keeps service targeting aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overfit to short-term noise.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Historical concluded data (Periods 1-19) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and no recent sustained demand regime shift. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Because promised and observed lead time are 0, I use L=default to keep OR engine aligned with reality. Demand forecast uses all historical samples (no changepoint detected) so mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples). Volatility uses full-sample std scaled for (1+L) so sigma_hat=default. This yields a base-stock equal to the long-run demand mean and a conservative cap; with profit=holding, the target service level is 50%, balancing fill rate and holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period 20) consistently show arrivals same period as order, confirming lead time = 0; no missing shipments observed. Demand shows variability with occasional spikes but no sustained regime change (need \u22653 periods to confirm). To be conservative and let the OR backend use full-sample statistics, set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed changepoint and current zero inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand has increased substantially versus early 2019. I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples: Periods 17-21 = 35,43,92,131,142) to capture the new higher regime and target service while avoiding excessive holding. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize avoiding stockouts given zero lead time and sharply rising recent demand while keeping holding costs in check.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has risen sharply since late June: last five weekly demands = [43, 92, 131, 142, 133] (Periods 18-22) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime versus earlier weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must target the new higher demand. Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over; use default lead time to keep orders same-period. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new regime mean and avoid understocking. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices bias the backend toward a higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting the OR engine cap orders per its cap rule.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has jumped sharply in the last 5 weeks (Period 19-23 demands = 92,131,142,133,141) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover elevated near-term demand. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0; use default (promised) lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime and higher volatility; this increases base-stock to protect service while the backend caps orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained, large demand increase beginning Period 19. I keep L=default (promised 0; confirmed historically). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N using the most recent regime to capture the higher mean and volatility (use N=6 covering Periods 19-24). This raises the backend base-stock to improve service during the new high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N reflects increased variability to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg increased from 55.06 to 130.83 (+137%) (Periods 1-18 vs 19-24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 with high weekly demand (Periods 19-25 average ~131). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we are exposed to stockouts this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods; use promised/default L. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 19-25, length=7) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock to meet the elevated demand while limiting excess hold. recent_N N=7 chosen per detected regime length (max(min(regime_length,20),3)).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (higher mean through Period 26). Reconcile: no pipeline stock, so orders must cover current period demand plus safety. Set L to default (promised 0) because conclude history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 19-26, length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility (recent_N N=8). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the new regime to raise service while the holding cost equals profit so safety is moderate.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 19 (weeks 19-27) with frequent stockouts and large orders; on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To match the new higher demand while avoiding excess holding, use the promised/default lead time (0) and base demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime (last 9 observed weeks, Periods 19-27). This focuses the base-stock calculation on the elevated mean and volatility, improving service while limiting extra inventory given holding cost = profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 19 (weekly demand roughly 92\u2013163, recent weeks ~130\u2013160). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover this higher regime. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple period concludes). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 19\u201328 form the new regime, regime_length=10) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this focuses the base-stock on current higher demand and avoids underordering. This balances service (capture higher sales) vs holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than long-run lower-demand history.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period1-29 arrivals all same-period). Demand regime shift at Period 19 produced substantially higher weekly demand (mean before P19 ~55 \u2192 after P19 ~131). To capture the new regime, set L to promised (0) and use recent_N over the post-changepoint window (Periods 19-29, 11 weeks) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of recent high-demand samples. Sigma set to recent_N (same N) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep service during the higher-demand regime while avoiding inflation from older low-demand data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift up starting Period 19 (avg increased ~+137%). Recent demand remains high; I use a recent_N demand forecast to capture the new regime (last 5 weeks mean \u2248142 units) and recent volatility for sigma_hat. L left as default (promised = 0) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat computed from same recent window. This raises target base-stock to meet current high demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 19 (sustained higher weekly sales through Period 31). On-hand=56, in-transit=0 so pipeline low versus recent weekly demand (~100+). Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime: Periods 19\u201331 (regime length 13) so N=13 to capture the new higher mean/variance while keeping enough samples. This raises the base-stock to service the higher demand while sigma based on recent variability tightens safety stock to recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=31, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised = 0) because concludes consistently confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/volatility: selected N=14 (Periods 19\u201332 available = 14 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent elevated demand and variability, helping the OR backend raise the base-stock to improve service while avoiding excessive inventory by using a regime-specific sample window.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=20, in-transit=0. To respect the confirmed zero lead time and emphasize the higher post-change demand, I use L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the new higher mean/variance: there are 15 samples since Period 19 (Periods 19\u201333), so set N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices steer the OR engine toward a base-stock sized for the new regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data; using recent_N for sigma preserves observed volatility for safety stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (weekly demand rose from ~55 to ~130). Current on-hand=48, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been reliably 0 in concluded history; I retain default L to match observed operations. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/variance \u2014 regime length = 16 (Periods 19\u201334), so N=16. This keeps base_stock aligned with the elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability controls safety-stock; with profit=holding, target service quantile is 0.5 (z=0), so mu_hat drives orders and sigma_hat governs capped-order sizing.

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has settled higher after the regime shift detected at Period 19; last 5 observed demands (Periods 32-36) = 103,112,83,64,80 (avg=88.4). On-hand=44, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover for upcoming demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-day lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime and avoid dilution from older low-demand history. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices increase the backend base-stock to meet the higher recent mean while keeping variance estimation tied to recent weeks, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given no in-transit) against holding cost by not using the full historical mean which would understate current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 19 (higher weekly demand since). I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (covers Periods 19\u201337, the confirmed higher-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent high-demand regime; this biases base stock toward higher service while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data. No evidence of lost shipments or new changepoints.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 19; to capture the post-shift demand level I use the most recent regime data. I set L=default (promised 0) so orders target same-period availability. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (the recent regime length, Periods 19\u201338) so the backend's base-stock reflects current higher mean and volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5, neutral service/hold).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-39 arrivals matched orders). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 19 (higher mean from Periods 19+). To reflect the new regime I use recent_N=20 (covers Periods 20-39, capped at 20) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility from the most relevant data. L kept as default=promised (0) since concluded history confirms 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses service level on the newer, higher-demand regime and limits overstating variability from older low-demand periods; this helps balance equal profit and holding costs by relying on recent demand statistics for base-stock calculation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent demand has moderated from the mid-year spike; last 10 weeks demand avg \u224875.5 units. On-hand=87, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock already covers ~1 week at recent pace. Lead time previously confirmed as 0; use promised/default L=0. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization and avoid overweighting older low-volume early-year samples. This balances service (maintain stock ~75 units demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical data shows sustained regime lift starting Period 19 but recent weekly demand has declined from peak; last 5 demands (P37-P41) = [88,49,61,28,47], avg \u224854.6. Promised lead time and observed concludes have been 0 historically, so keep L at default. To reflect the recent lower demand regime (and short lead time), set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks to avoid overstocking; set sigma_hat from the same recent 5-week sample to capture current volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand while limiting holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0). No evidence of new sustained lead-time or seasonal shift that warrants recording.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible from Period 42 conclude. Historical concluded data show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (periods 19-24 and onward higher mean). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0), since conclude history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period-19 high-demand regime (regime length from P19 to current >20, so cap at 20). I apply the same recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent high-demand samples) while sigma from recent variability informs safety stock; using recent data avoids dilution from the much lower pre-Period-19 demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (Periods 1\u201343), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (mean increased materially). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the most recent stable post-shift regime (Periods 24\u201343 cover the high-demand regime; using 20 latest samples captures recent seasonality while capping N per rules). This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost by relying on recent observations rather than all-time lower pre-shift data.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime around Period 19, but recent weeks (Periods 41-44) show lower sales (47,64,17,17) likely seasonal and not a confirmed new regime. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed on-shelf speed and stable lead time, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (uses full-sample mean and std). This avoids overreacting to short recent dips while letting the backend compute service-level- balanced base stock given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

A sustained demand regime shift was previously recorded (higher demand from Period 19 onward). No new sustained changepoint in recent periods; therefore use default lead time and default demand uncertainty calculations so backend uses full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 19 onward, but the last 4 weeks (Periods 43-46) show a clear seasonal drop (demands = 17,17,21,15). Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=0 historically. To avoid overstock during this current low-demand spell while still covering the immediate (L+1) period, I use recent demand estimates based on the latest 4 periods. Chosen methods: L uses default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime and keep target base-stock conservative. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward lower replenishment now, balancing holding cost against service given the observed short-term demand drop.
