Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent available demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224842.4 units/week (samples: 36,56,33,45,42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals observed yet. Promised lead time is 0 and no evidence to change it. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) using the standard base-stock formula without overfitting to short history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Last conclude shows Period 1 order (58) arrived in Period 1 => observed lead time = 0. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [36,56,33,45,42] show no clear recent regime shift. To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend uses promised L=0 and (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019 Jan) show mean demand ~42.4 and std ~8. Recent concluded periods show large censored demand (period1 demand=88, period2 demand=113) but both were stock-limited (sold equaled arrivals), so no reliable evidence of a sustained demand regime change. Observed lead times (Period1 and Period2) were 0; average lead time = 0. To avoid overreacting to censored high demand, use conservative defaults: L set by observed average, mu_hat and sigma_hat use historical-sample defaults scaled by (1+L). This balances service-level (covers typical demand) while limiting holding cost given current uncertainty and zero pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is much higher than the historical baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals pending; no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are 0 periods each time, so set L by calculating observed average. Demand shows a clear changepoint: three consecutive high-demand periods (88,113,135) vs historical mean ~42.4, so forecast using the recent regime. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the new mean demand over the review+lead window. Volatility has also risen with the regime shift, so set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding exposure tied to the short lead time (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from 42.4 to 112 (+164%), sustained for 3 periods (demands: 88,113,135).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1509.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent demand has been elevated with a confirmed regime shift in Periods 1-3 (demands 88,113,135) then a drop to 83 in Period 4. On-hand=68, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low relative to the recent high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times are 0 in all past arrivals, so I set L using observed lead times. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime (regime length=3) to avoid understocking if high demand returns: use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock for the short high-demand window while sigma reflects recent variability. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by prioritizing service under the recent elevated regime while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1226.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=85, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (P1..P5) show lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand has recent high variability (demands: 88,113,135,83,69) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and reflect current volatility. This balances higher service level for recent elevated demand while keeping holding cost awareness via recent std.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4, P5->P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (Period 1\u20136 conclude messages show orders arriving same period). Recent realized demand has softened after the short spike: last 3 concluded demands = 83, 69, 57. On-hand = 84, in-transit = 0. I use default lead time (promised=0) to match observed reliability, and set demand estimates using the most recent 3-period regime to capture the downward drift from the earlier spike while remaining responsive. sigma_hat uses the same recent 3 samples to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce excess holding while keeping service for the current demand level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has settled below the initial spike: last 4 demands = [83,69,57,55], avg ~66. On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L by calculating from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new lower regime (regime length=4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 4) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 4). This balances service (covers current period + lead) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost is low but demand has declined.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (P1->P1 ... P8->P8). Recent demand shows a previously observed spike (88,113,135) but last 5 concluded demands are 83,69,57,55,104 \u2014 a lower recent average. To be responsive to current recent demand while honoring confirmed LT=0, I set L using calculated observed lead times, and set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 5 periods to capture the recent post-spike regime. Sigma uses recent_N over 5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from the earlier isolated spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and recent demand has risen and been volatile (recent demands: Periods 7-9 = 55,104,187; earlier spike at P1-3 averaged ~112). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (focus on the most recent 3 periods to react to the surge) and for sigma use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service during the sustained uptick while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent regime and variability, use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 5 weeks).

To capture the current regime while keeping responsiveness (L\u22480), set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the recent higher mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1..P12 arrived same period). Recent demand has risen vs. early-sample baseline; last 5 concluded demands (P8-P12 = 104,187,98,156,148) indicate a higher regime. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times = 0). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N (N=5) to capture the newer higher mean; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base_stock to cover elevated near-term demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples; with L=0 orders arrive same period so pipeline is minimal and policy will cap orders appropriately.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated and more variable versus the initial Jan samples; last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 9-13) = [187,98,156,148,94] \u2192 mean \u2248136.6, showing a sustained higher-demand regime than the early-sample mean (42.4). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To capture the recent regime and reduce stockouts while avoiding excess holding, set lead time by calculation (confirmed 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the most relevant recent mean and volatility (1+L multiplier applied downstream).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=66, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and lead time has been reliably 0 in past concludes. Demand recently runs higher than the Jan samples; last 5 weekly demands (P10-P14) average ~126.6. To capture the recent high-demand regime while preserving the confirmed L=0, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the last-5-week mean across the review+lead period, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This biases the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts in the sustained higher-demand regime while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Recent demand has been elevated and variable compared to the small 2019-Jan sample; I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast reflect the most recent 5 observed weekly demands and volatility, so the base-stock and cap respond to current higher demand while limiting excess holding costs.

Use default demand and volatility (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine leverages full historical demand when computing base stock; this balances service level given high realized demand episodes while keeping holding cost in mind.

Promised lead time has been confirmed repeatedly as 0; use default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 weeks) so the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility reflect the most recent elevated mean and variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the high-demand regime) against holding cost by using a short lead-time assumption and recent-sample statistics.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent realized demand is much higher than the original Jan samples (historic sample mean 42.4) and has been elevated and volatile across many periods (recent weekly demands often >100). On-hand=84, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory is low relative to recent demand; promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows 0 actual lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 demand observations, which reflects the elevated recent average and adapts away from the small-Jan sample. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current demand while sigma_hat keeps safety stock responsive to recent variability; using recent data avoids understocking given the clear regime shift and confirmed 0 lead time.

Profit/holding implies a very high service quantile (q\u22480.95). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) which matches observed behavior. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this captures the sustained higher-demand regime seen since Period 1-3 shift while keeping estimates stable given many samples.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand =103, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over confirmed). Recent demand regime is much higher than the Jan sample mean; last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 19-23) = [201,216,158,108,99], mean=156.4, indicating the elevated regime persists. I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than the low-Jan variance. These parameters align the OR base-stock toward current demand while avoiding understock from outdated low-sample averages; using recent_N reduces stockouts while keeping holding costs controlled given L=0 and substantial on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=142, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times are all 0 so use calculate to let backend set L=0. Recent demand has trended materially above early-sample mean (last 5 demands: 216,158,108,99,102) \u2014 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the higher current regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (P1->P27), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1-3 shift (sustained high weekly demand through Period 27). To reflect the sustained higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data window.

I keep L as default (promised=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and capture current mean/volatility, so the OR backend will target service for current demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

To capture the recent elevated demand pattern, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the most recent 20 demand observations (covers the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility).

I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time=0 from concl. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical demand to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this leverages the full sample base while keeping safety stock driven by the backend's profit/(profit+holding) service-level logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent demand has been in a higher, stable regime (many weeks of 70\u2013220, typical recent weeks ~80\u2013110). On-hand=101, in-transit=0 so immediate coverage is good but we must size forecast to recent demand, not the small sample in the historical header. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L by calculate (uses observed lead times = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher regime and reduce influence of the small early sample set; same recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices align mu_hat/sigma_hat to current demand patterns so the base-stock balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) and avoids underordering given fast (0) arrivals.

2019-10-21: recent weekly demand has settled below the earlier extreme spikes. Last 5 observed demands (P32-P36) = [70,110,83,98,61], recent mean \u224884.4. On-hand=120, in-transit=0 so current coverage is healthy. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in history, so use promised/default lead time. To keep service high while avoiding excess holding given high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95), I forecast demand using the recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime and set sigma using the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand ~80 (last 4 weeks: 83,98,61,80) and historical series shows sustained higher post-shift demand; on-hand=40, in-transit=0 so current cover is low. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history \u2014 use promised/default L=0. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) we prioritize service; use default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full historical mean/SD ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances high service level (captures long-run mean and variability) while letting the OR cap limit oversized orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows no new sustained regime shift since prior insights, so use default demand/volatility estimators (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). High profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) implies the OR engine will target a high service level; default mu/sigma let backend compute base-stock and cap appropriately while avoiding manual overreaction to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods; keep promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated compared with mid-year peaks; to reflect current demand regime I use recent data to set demand mean and volatility. Chose recent_N=10 to capture the latest ~10 weeks (balances responsiveness with noise). These parameters let the OR engine size a base stock reflecting current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). No new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over insights. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed punctual arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service level and holding cost given current on-hand cover.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=138, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals through Period 41). Recent demand shows no new sustained regime change vs. historical pattern. Given very high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) and confirmed L=0, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances a high service target with holding cost awareness and avoids overfitting to short recent fluctuations.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows high and volatile weekly demand with confirmed lead time = 0 in past concludes; current on-hand=26, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Profit/Holding ratio implies very high target service level (q\u22480.95). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) consistent with observed concludes, and use default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages the full historical sample set to produce a high base-stock appropriate for the high q while avoiding hand-tuned forecasts absent a new sustained regime change.

Promised lead time=0 is supported by observed history; keeping L at calculated/default 0 avoids inflating pipeline. Use default demand and volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, providing a high service level (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while letting the OR engine cap orders to control inventory.

Profit/holding imply high target service level (q\u22480.95). I select default L to use promised lead time (0) and default demand stats (use full-sample mean/std) so the OR engine computes base-stock from all available history and the high service-level z.
