Men's T-shirt (casual apparel) can see modest gift-related uplift. b) Demand regime: historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average ~42.4 units/week (samples: 36,56,33,45,42). No evidence of a sustained regime change. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time unknown; no concluded arrivals in history to infer lead time. Treat actual lead time as potentially \u22650; therefore orders placed now may or may not arrive before this period's demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 => no coverage for current period. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) while profit is high ($19/unit), favoring a bias to stock to avoid lost sales. e) Order logic: Forecast baseline demand \u224842 units/week. Apply a small seasonal uplift for Valentine (~+10% \u2192 \u224846 units). Because lead time is uncertain and arriving this period is not guaranteed, order enough to cover current period and next period (2 periods) to avoid stockouts if lead_time\u22651: 46\xd72 \u224892.
