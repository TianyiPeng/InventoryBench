Demand analysis: historical weekly sales for this SKU: 2019-01-07:25, 01-14:26, 01-21:20, 01-28:32, 02-04:48 \u2014 recent mean = 30.2 units/week with one high outlier (48 on 02-04). No sustained regime change (insufficient consecutive periods >=3 to declare a shift). Lead time & orders: supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unconfirmed; no concluded arrivals or in-transit shipments to infer delays or losses. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current period. Order logic: aim to meet expected weekly demand while limiting holding costs (holding $1 vs profit $19). Using the 5-week sample mean (~30 units) and treating the 02-04 spike as a single outlier, place an order to cover one week of demand (30 units). This balances service level and holding cost given lead-time uncertainty.",
