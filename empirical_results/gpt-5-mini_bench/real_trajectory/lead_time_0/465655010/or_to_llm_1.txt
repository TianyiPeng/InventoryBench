Context/calendar: current date 2019-02-11 is three days before Valentine\u2019s Day (2019-02-14); product is women's lingerie (high relevance to Valentine\u2019s), so near-term demand is likely to spike above baseline. Lead-time/arrival risk: no concluded arrivals to infer lost shipments; promised L=0 could still be truthful but arrival confirmation will be delayed in conclude messages. Decision rule applied: raise order above OR to cover an anticipated short-term Valentine\u2019s uplift while keeping exposure moderate given holding cost. Quantification: OR=187; raise by ~40% to cover expected surge (target order=260).
