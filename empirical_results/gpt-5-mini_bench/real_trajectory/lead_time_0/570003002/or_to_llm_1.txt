======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so nothing available for Period 47 demand unless we order now. Demand analysis: recent 5 concluded periods demands (P42\u2013P46) = [99,35,36,47,60], 5-period average \u2248 55.4; longer-run historical sample mean = 47.6. OR recommendation = 89 (uses promised L and full history). Service/stock tradeoff: profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 (high service target) which explains OR's high suggestion. Adjustment decision: given confirmed L=0, our order arrives before Period 47 demand, so we only need to cover expected single-period demand plus modest safety. The 99-unit value is a single large spike (P42) not sustained; recent median/mean point to ~55. Ordering 89 risks unnecessary holding cost at $1/unit/period with no evidence of sustained elevated demand. Final order = 60 units \u2014 covers recent average (~55) with slight cushion for variability while limiting holding costs. Short operational note: monitor P47 conclude for demand outcome; if sustained higher demand appears over 3+ periods, increase future orders and record carry-over insight.",
