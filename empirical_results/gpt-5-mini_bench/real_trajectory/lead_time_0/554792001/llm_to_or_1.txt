Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean = (7+33+28+63+45)/5 = 35.2 units. No concluded arrivals to infer lead time, so use promised/default lead time. To balance low profit vs. holding cost (profit = holding cost), use default forecast and volatility so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std; this avoids overreacting to sparse early-period noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand: Period samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show weekly demands [7,33,28,63,45] (mean=35.2). Period 1 conclude shows an order placed and arrived same period (ordered=36 arrived=36, lead_time observed=0). On-hand=7, in-transit=0, so available = 7. Given observed same-period arrival and promised lead_time=0, use observed lead time in L estimation. Use population-wide demand stats (no strong recent changepoint evident) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults which scale all-sample mean/std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This balances service (profit = holding cost, so target q=0.5) while avoiding overreacting to single-period noise or lost-shipment risk.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed in P1 and P2) and rising demand (sold 29 then 35 of available stock, demand 29 then 47). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we need to replenish. I choose default L to trust the promised lead time (observed avg lead_time=0). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of the full sample history; this balances service vs holding cost given limited evidence for a sustained regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (periods 1-3 concludes) = [29,47,38]; historical older samples = [7,33,28,63,45]. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set L by calculate (average of observed lead times = 0). Demand appears slightly higher in the most recent 3 concluded weeks (29,47,38) versus older history, so I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime. I match sigma_hat to recent volatility using recent_N N=3. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the recent higher demand while reflecting zero observed lead time, limiting unnecessary holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P4) show consistent same-period arrivals with observed lead_time=0. Recent demand (last 4 concluded weeks) = [29,47,38,38], avg=38. Use promised lead time (default) because all observed lead times = 0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand regime versus older historical samples. This boosts the backend forecast to cover the upcoming (1+L) review+lead horizon while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent variability; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent weeks (Periods 1-5) show stable weekly demand around 29\u201347 (recent mean \u224837.2) with no sustained regime shift. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). On-hand=4, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L using calculated recent evidence (average observed lead time=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (use last 5 demand samples) to focus the forecast on the current stable regime and keep safety stock responsive to recent variability. These choices give the OR engine a demand forecast tuned to current weeks while reflecting observed zero lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1-6) show actual lead_time=0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-6) = [29,47,38,38,34,45], mean=38.5; variability present. I choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the most recent regime, which captures the current demand level and volatility while avoiding older, sparse pre-history. With L=default (0) this gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast centered on recent demand to balance service (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand) against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent weekly demand has averaged roughly mid-30s-to-40s (observed demands: 29,47,38,38,34,45,43). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, but historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 each concluded period). I therefore use L=default (promised lead time=0) because observed lead time is stable. I select mu_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean using all available demand samples so the base-stock reflects the full history. I select sigma_hat=default so volatility is estimated from all samples. This balances service (capture recent 30s\u201340s weekly demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 leads to moderate safety stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08. Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-8) is consistently in the high-30s/40s (29,47,38,38,34,45,43,37). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals pending. All historical concludes show orders arriving same period, so actual lead time appears to be 0. To reflect the recent stable higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 8 concluded periods for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture current demand level ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 8) and recent variability. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since observed lead time is consistently 0. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the (L+1)-period demand while sigma_hat captures recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1\u2013P8 all arrived same period in their conclude messages).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and stable weekly demand (period demands last 9 periods: 29,47,38,38,34,45,43,37,36). On-hand=3, in-transit=0, profit=holding so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0). Confirmed lead time=0 in history, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this lets the OR engine set base_stock = mean demand and balance service vs holding given symmetric profit/holding costs. With on-hand low and no pipeline, the engine will order up to that base stock.

Recent weekly demand has ranged ~25\u201347 with multiple samples; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no new signal, use promised/default lead time and let the backend compute (1+L)-scaled demand mean and volatility from all samples so the OR engine can apply its capped base-stock rule. This balances service (use observed demand history) vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent weekly demand has averaged moderate values (historical samples and Periods 1\u201311 demand show weekly demands typically 25\u201347, recent weeks 36,25,29). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed in carry-over). I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a balanced base-stock given equal profit and holding cost ($1 vs $1). This avoids overreacting to short recent dips while keeping safety stock for same-period arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201312) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). No overdue shipments. Demand history shows moderate weekly variability but no recent, sustained regime change. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no strong evidence of demand shift, use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has softened vs earlier weeks (most recent 5 period demands = 36,25,29,30,15; mean=27). On-hand=21, in-transit=0, lead time historically confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), use a recent-window forecast to reflect the lower recent demand and reduce overstock risk. Set L to promised (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime based on the last 5 demand observations.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201314), so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has eased (last 3 concluded demands: 15,13,13) but not a sustained regime shift; therefore use default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders conservative given current on-hand and equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weeks show lower demand (Periods 13\u201315: 15,13,31) but overall historical samples include higher earlier demand; on-hand=3, in-transit=0 and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Use promised lead time (default) so backend keeps same-period replenishment. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5) and avoids overfitting short recent dip. No in-transit arrivals pending; small on-hand means orders will be triggered by backend base-stock policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical conclues (Periods 1\u201316) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period), and recent demand has moderated (weekly demands mostly between 13\u201338 with no sustained spike). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and balanced profit vs holding ($1 profit, $1 holding), use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service without overstocking while respecting observed reliable 0 LT and recent lower demand.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0 (Periods 1\u201317 all arrived same period), demand samples stable with recent lower weeks but no sustained regime shift. No overdue or lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep backend aligned with observed behavior.

Recent demand has settled lower than early spikes: last 10 period demands (P9\u2013P18) show a moderate, stable regime vs earlier high variance. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the new, lower-demand regime (balances service level vs holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand plus measured variability).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows mostly steady weekly demand with a single large spike (Period 19 demand=88) but not a sustained regime change (only one period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current period demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. Therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimates (use all historical samples). This keeps the OR backend's base-stock anchored to long-run mean while avoiding overreacting to the single large spike; if spike persists, switch to recent_N in future periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 (sustained through Period 20). Demand has a recent high-variance regime (notably Periods 19\u201320: demand 88 then 50) after a quieter run in Periods 13\u201318. To capture the recent regime while smoothing older data I use recent_N over the last 8 demand samples (Periods 13\u201320) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L kept as default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. These choices let the OR backend size the base stock to reflect the recent jump in mean and higher volatility while the default L prevents overstating lead time and excessive pipeline targets.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period 21) confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has jumped recently: Periods 19-21 demands = [88,50,127], signaling a new high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time 0) since conclude history confirms 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to let the backend base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent three periods (captures the new regime while limiting older low-demand influence). This raises the base-stock to meet the elevated recent demand while sigma based on the same recent window increases safety stock to preserve service without excessive long-run holding from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg P1-18 = 29.9 units/week -> avg P19-21 = 88.3 units/week (+195%).

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand regime: large sustained spike beginning Period 19 (weeks 19-22 show much higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher regime. Lead time historically confirmed 0 (many concluded same-period arrivals). Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the new regime (most recent 4 periods: P19-22) to reflect the higher mean/volatility and avoid dilution by pre-spike data.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (P19-23 demands = 88,50,127,113,38; recent mean \u224883.2 vs historical mean \u224829.9). All concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand=57, in-transit=0; with L=0 current period demand occurs after decision so we size to recent elevated regime. I set L=default to use promised (confirmed) 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (using P19\u2013P23) to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping N within [3,20]. This raises target base-stock to match current demand spike and sigma to reflect recent volatility, balancing service (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given current on-hand.

To capture the higher recent demand, set L to default (promised = 0) and forecast demand using recent samples from the new high-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=6 (Periods 19\u201324) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-changepoint mean/volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 => z*=0). This keeps base_stock driven by the updated recent mean while using recent volatility for the cap calculation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=17, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N=7 (Periods 19-25) for demand mean and volatility (regime length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-changepoint behavior.

These settings steer the OR engine to raise the base-stock to meet higher weekly demand while keeping holding risk grounded in recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19 (avg P1-18=29.9 \u2192 avg P19-26\u224888.3+, sustained for 8 periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the new high-demand regime (N = regime length = 8, within [3,20]) so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent higher mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (much higher weekly demand since P19). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Use L=default since lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. For demand forecast use recent_N over the new high-demand regime to capture the higher mean and variance: regime length P19\u2013P27 = 9, so N=9. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=9 to make the base-stock reflect the new higher demand while avoiding overstock from older low-demand weeks. This balances service (high profit per sale equals higher target fill) against holding cost by anchoring on the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 19 with avg P19-28 = 88.3 units/week (10 periods); on-hand=12, in-transit=0 so current coverage is far below new demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to use observed lead times (calculate) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples to reflect the higher mean and volatility: recent_N with N=10 (Periods 19\u201328). This biases the OR base-stock toward meeting the new ~88/week demand while sigma estimation over the same window captures recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (Periods 1\u201329 confirms). Demand regime increased starting Period 19 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period 29). To capture the post-changepoint demand, set L to promised (0) and use recent_N on demand stats covering the new regime (Periods 19\u201329, length=11) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility. This will raise the base-stock to reduce stockouts under the confirmed 0 lead time while keeping holding cost considered by the OR cap.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted up at Period 19 (avg P1-18=29.9 -> avg P19-21=88.3) and elevated demand persisted through Period 30. Current on-hand=39, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 arrivals occur same period ordered. To reflect sustained higher demand, I use recent_N demand estimates drawn from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 19\u201330, 12 samples). L uses default (promised lead time=0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 so the OR backend builds base_stock from the recent high-demand mean and volatility, balancing service (reduce stockouts at higher demand) against holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand regime shifted up at Period 19 (carry-over): avg P1-18=29.9 -> avg P19-21=88.3 (+195%). Current inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Because the high-demand regime has persisted through Periods 19\u201331 (13 weeks), I set lead time to default (promised=0, confirmed historically). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (capture the new regime: last 13 demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the elevated-demand regime. This increases the base-stock to meet much higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock for observed variability; using recent data avoids overweighting the low-demand pre-Period-19 history and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2013P32). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 19 (P1-18 mean\u224829.9 \u2192 P19-32 mean substantially higher). To capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping controller aware of short lead time, I keep L as default (promised=0) and set demand estimates using recent data from the post-changepoint regime. I choose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 19\u201332) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets appropriate base-stock for the higher mean/volatility, limiting overstocks by using only the confirmed new regime. No evidence of lost shipments; policy will thus balance service level vs holding cost using the recent-regime mean and variance.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P33) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (avg P1-18 \u224829.9 \u2192 avg P19-33 \u224888+ earlier but recent weeks settle ~46\u201361). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time from conclude history. Demand has been in the higher regime since P19; I use recent_N (N=15, Periods 19\u201333) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and safety stock reflect the post-changepoint mean/volatility. This balances service (capture higher demand regime) against holding cost by sizing base stock to recent higher mean and variability while avoiding using older low-demand data.

Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 19 (avg P1-18 ~29.9 -> avg P19-21 ~88.3); recent weeks (P19\u2013P34) reflect the new, higher-demand regime. No overdue shipments. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N on the post-changepoint regime to capture the elevated mean/variance: N=16 (Periods 19\u201334). This raises base_stock to serve (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level against holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has stayed in the higher regime confirmed earlier (shift starting Period 19; elevated weekly demand since). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of high demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (see carry-over). I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime to capture the new mean (N=17 covers Periods 19\u201335). I use the same recent_N (N=17) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward the current higher demand while keeping variability estimates aligned with the same regime, balancing service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19 (avg P19-36 >> pre-period levels). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated regime. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in concludes), so use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime: select N=18 (Periods 19\u201336) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the new demand level while avoiding bias from older low-demand history.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 37. A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 19 (avg P1-18 = 29.9 -> avg P19-37 high; large, sustained increase through most recent periods). To capture the post-shift demand level I set L to default (promised 0, consistent with observed arrivals) and use recent_N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the 19-week high-demand regime (Period 19\u201337). This keeps the base-stock tied to the new higher mean while reflecting recent volatility, balancing service (avoid stockouts given current zero on-hand/pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (avg P1-18 = 29.9 \u2192 avg P19-38 \u2248 88.3, large + sustained increase). On-hand=6, in-transit=0, so available stock is very low vs. elevated demand; no overdue shipments observed. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded messages. I set L to default (use promised 0). To capture the new, sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 19\u201338, length 20); per rules N = 20. This biases the backend forecast to the higher recent mean and higher variability, increasing replenishment to reduce stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit=holding cost (service-level driven).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (higher weekly demand). To reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent data from the post-changepoint regime: set L to default (promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed arrivals) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 weeks of demand in the high-demand regime). This provides the OR backend an updated (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility that prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while sigma_hat captures recent variability; with profit=holding cost the backend will trade off service vs holding using its internal q formula.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (avg P1-18=29.9 \u2192 avg P19-21=88.3) and high demand persists through recent weeks. No delayed/lost shipments observed (lead time repeatedly confirmed 0). I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 20 weeks to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the OR backend on the elevated recent mean/volatility while relying on confirmed zero lead time so orders can replenish same period and avoid stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Inventory currently adequate for short horizon but future demand remains elevated. I set L=default to respect the confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-change high-demand regime (use last 20 weeks to reflect sustained higher mean and recent seasonality). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility; these choices steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to protect service during the new higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimates anchored to recent observations.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Demand regime shifted up at Period 19 and has remained at the higher level through Period 42; on-hand=35, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically 0). To reflect the sustained higher demand I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by history) and use recent_N=20 for demand mean/volatility to capture the post-change regime (use last up-to-20 samples from the high-demand regime). This raises the base-stock to protect service while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent statistics balances service (higher mu) against holding cost given profit=holding, avoiding excessive inventory by relying on observed post-change volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Demand regime shift at Period 19 raised weekly demand materially; recent weeks include both very high (summer/early-fall) and a low week (P43=12) consistent with holiday variability. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing recent variability, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint demand regime (most recent 20 samples since P24\u2013P43) so the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the new demand level and recent volatility while avoiding overreaction to single-week dips. This balances service against $1/unit holding cost given profit=$1/unit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P44). Recent weekly demand has been lower in Nov-Dec (P39-44 = 42,38,28,39,12,10) after the large mid-year regime; current on-hand (~59) is ample for short lead time. To keep orders responsive to the recent softening, I use L=default (promised 0), set mu_hat using recent demand (captures latest demand level) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps base-stock low enough to limit holding cost while preserving service with same-period replenishment.

Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 weeks (the post-change regime), ensuring the OR backend raises target base-stock to match higher demand while limiting excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical data show confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (higher mean). I will trust promised lead time (0) so orders arrive same period. To reflect the post-shift higher-demand regime and recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=20 samples (captures latest ~20 weeks since the regime change while capping N at 20). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while keeping variance estimates responsive. With profit=holding, the backend will set a target service quantile close to 50%; using recent_N for mu and sigma focuses inventory on the current high-demand regime and limits excess holding from older low-demand history.
