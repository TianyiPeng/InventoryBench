Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed weekly demand shows a clear upswing (samples: 0,0,24,58,84). On-hand + in-transit = 0 so we must cover upcoming demand. Promised lead time = 0 (no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise). I choose L=default to let backend use the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the pronounced recent rise across all available samples so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and sigma_hat = std over last 5 samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This biases orders toward higher recent demand to avoid stockouts given zero inventory while keeping volatility estimated from recent history to limit overordering and holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples mean=55.33 (24,58,84) vs prior mean=0 (two earlier samples); sustained increase over 3+ periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent demand regime confirmed starting 2019-01-21; latest four post-changepoint samples = 24,58,84,129 (mean=73.75) showing sustained higher demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so replenishment needed. Observed lead time from Period 1 conclude = 0 periods (order placed and arrived same period); use calculate to reflect observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to base forecast on the four-sample elevated regime, and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise base_stock to meet higher demand while keeping variance estimate focused on the new regime, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples 24,58,84) and continued high demand in the last two concluded periods (129,268), giving a recent regime of 5 samples. Observed lead times from concluded messages are 0 (two observations). Set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime ((24,58,84,129,268)). Sigma set recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in this regime. These choices tell the OR engine to size base-stock to the recent elevated mean while keeping holding cost tradeoffs in mind. No evidence of missing shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent history shows confirmed same-period arrivals (observed lead_times = 0 for Periods 1-3) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples: 24,58,84; mean=55.33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected next-period demand. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from concluded messages (observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = 3 = recent regime length). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These parameters prioritize meeting the higher current demand while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Daily Profit: $696.00, Daily Holding Cost: $97.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent history shows actual lead time = 0 in concluded periods 1\u20134 and no in-transit units; on-hand = 97. Demand regime shifted starting 2019-01-21 (sustained >3 weeks); recent demand mean (last 3 samples) = 55.33. To capture the new higher demand quickly, keep L = promised (default = 0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the most recent regime. This increases service level to reduce stockouts while holding cost is moderate (profit $4 vs holding $1), and current on-hand (97) plus expected order will be reconciled by OR engine.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent, same-period arrivals (observed lead_time = 0 for Orders placed P1\u2013P5) and sustained elevated demand across the last 5 periods (demands: 129,268,233,174,160). On-hand=105, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent high-demand regime (5-period regime), so the OR backend will size base-stock for current elevated demand while reflecting recent variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated and variable (period demands: 129,268,233,174,160,207) vs earlier low preseason samples; on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in all past orders, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and its variability, set demand forecast using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand level and volatility. This balances service (covering upcoming week of demand) against holding cost by sizing base_stock from recent mean and observed std.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical demand series shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples 24,58,84) and recent samples remain elevated; to keep service while limiting holding cost, I use lead time = promised (default 0) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime samples (capture the post-changepoint higher demand). Using recent_N=3 focuses the base-stock on the confirmed higher-demand regime, tightening responsiveness and avoiding overstock from older zero-demand samples.

All observed arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To cover current period demand and keep service given profit/holding ($4/$1), I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates based on the last 3 weeks (recent_N=3) to capture the higher recent demand and modestly higher variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been high and stable since the regime shift noted in Jan (sustained >3 periods). Current on-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded orders P1\u2013P9 all arrived same period, so lead time effectively 0. To target service while limiting holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8 high service), I set L to use observed lead time and use recent_N (last 5 weeks: Periods 5\u20139 demand = 160,207,221,245,187) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility for the review+lead window.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized weekly demand is high and stable (last 5 demands: 207,221,245,187,252 \u2192 mean\u2248222). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. Lead time has repeatedly been 0 in concluded history; use observed-average to capture that. Set L via calculate to reflect confirmed 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks) and volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to service current demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (Periods 1\u201311 arrivals same period). Recent demand is elevated and stable: last 5 concluded demands (P7\u2013P11) = 221,245,187,252,253 \u2192 mean=231.6. To match current high recent demand and confirmed 0 lead time, set L by calculation of observed lead times (0), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to target (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248231.6, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (high recent demand) vs holding cost by sizing orders to recent realized demand with short lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (orders P1..P12 arrived same period). Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has persisted across many periods; recent high-volume behavior should drive forecasts. Use promised/default lead time (0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing older zero-demand samples. Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings give the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast anchored to the recent elevated demand, balancing service level against holding costs given profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed); no missing shipments. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained since 2019-01-21). I set L to default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime using the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 187,252,253,246,147) so mu_hat reflects the near-term mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost exposure moderated by basing forecasts on the most recent samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=144, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time historically observed as 0; use calculate to reflect observed history. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 samples (captures current demand level and volatility). These parameters will raise the base stock to service the ~200/week demand while the backend caps orders to control per-period order size and holding cost (profit=4, holding=1 leads to a high service quantile).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-27. On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Historical conclues (P1..P15) consistently show actual lead time 0 and a sustained demand regime since 2019-01-21. Recent demand (last 5 periods P11..P15 = 253,246,147,114,138) still reflects the new regime but with falling tail; to keep the OR backend responsive to the recent lower demand trend while respecting the established regime, I set L=default (promised lead time=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this reduces overstock risk vs using all samples and lets the base-stock adapt to the most recent demand pattern and current on-hand position.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in earlier periods). Demand has been in a lower-but-stable post-regime level recently; use the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current regime (Periods 12-16: demands 246,147,114,138,125) so the forecast reflects recent variance and mean. With profit $4 and holding $1 (high target service level), using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides responsiveness while avoiding overstock given no pipeline. L set to default (promised 0) consistent with observed zero lead time.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using recent_N=5 to capture the current regime; match sigma to recent volatility (recent_N=5). This ensures orders cover the near-term elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Demand has remained in the elevated regime that began 2019-01-21; to capture recent weekly demand level and variability I use the last 8 weeks to set demand mean and volatility so the OR backend can size base-stock and the cap appropriately.

Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201319) consistently show actual lead time = 0; demand has operated in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained >3 periods). To reflect confirmed lead time and focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime, set L using observed average (calculate). For demand and volatility use recent_N to capture the current regime (N=10 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 10) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 10). This balances service (capture elevated mean) vs holding cost by restricting lookback to the sustained high-demand regime.

Demand history shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (already recorded). Given confirmed lead time=0 and limited seed samples, use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples; this balances service (profit/holding ratio) while avoiding overfitting to recent variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand is high and volatile (multiple weeks of 200+ demand since late May); on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. To keep the OR engine responsive to recent demand regime (post-Jan shift and the sustained high summer demand), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples (last 8 weeks) so the backend bases base-stock on current demand and variance rather than long-ago zeros. This balances service (capture current high demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent_N=8 rather than all historical data.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0) and a sustained demand regime lift since 2019-01-21 with recent weekly demand in the 200\u2013300 range. To balance high profit ($4) vs $1 holding cost, keep promised lead time (default=0) and base demand forecast on recent data to reflect the elevated regime and volatility. Using recent_N=20 captures the latest high-demand weeks so OR backend sets a base-stock that services the current high demand while limiting excessive holdings.

Demand has been elevated and stable since the regime shift detected beginning 2019-01-21; use recent demand to forecast. Set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by history). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current elevated regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. This focuses orders on current demand patterns and balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by using recent mean/volatility rather than long-ago zero-demand data.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (last 5 demands: 306,320,231,272,229; recent mean ~271.6). On-hand=51, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 -> target service quantile high), use a recent-based demand forecast (capture current elevated regime) so OR backend sets base stock around current high mean. L uses promised lead time to reflect observed 0 LT. mu_hat uses recent 5-sample mean (1+L)*mean to react to sustained higher demand. sigma_hat uses recent 5-sample std to reflect current variability for safety stock sizing.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show lead time = 0; demand has been in the elevated regime established from 2019-01-21 onward. No evidence of lost shipments or a new demand regime in the last 3+ periods. I set L to 'calculate' so the OR engine uses the observed average lead time (confirmed 0) rather than the promised default. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, ensuring the base-stock reflects the long-run elevated demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to historical volatility. This balances service (profit) vs holding cost given stable 0 lead time and no in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been high and variable since the Jan 21 regime shift; last many weeks show sustained weekly demand between ~170\u2013371 with occasional peaks. On-hand=96, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed (lead time historically 0). I set L=default to respect promised lead time (0) confirmed by prior concludes. To keep the OR backend responsive to recent high demand while limiting holding cost, I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect the last ~20 periods' mean and volatility (captures summer peak variability). This balances service level (captures recent elevated demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand settled at ~160\u2013280/wk; on-hand=123, in-transit=0, so coverage is low vs recent demand. Lead time historically confirmed 0 (many concluded arrivals). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 23\u201327 demand: 272,229,175,171,158) so the OR engine sizes orders to cover current demand levels while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier); no overdue/lost shipments currently. Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21 (sustained higher demand). Recent demand (Periods 17-28) averages ~242 units/week; I use a recent-N forecast to capture current regime while L=default keeps promised lead time (0). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to target current weekly demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to capture recent volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned to recent demand and avoid overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=120, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated and variable but no new changepoint since the Jan shift; maintain promised lead time. To capture current seasonality and recent demand level/variance I use recent_N with N=20 (uses last 20 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock reflecting recent weeks. This balances high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) (q=0.8) by relying on recent demand evidence to maintain service while avoiding excess inventory given current on-hand.

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed behavior and avoid overfitting to recent week-to-week noise, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (high observed demand) against holding cost given sizeable on-hand inventory.

To remain responsive to recent demand levels (last few weeks have been lower ~100-180) I set lead time to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent 5 weeks, which helps the OR engine size base-stock to balance high profit (profit=4) versus holding cost (1) while avoiding excess inventory given current on-hand.

Current inventory: on-hand=100, in-transit=0. Given confirmed LT=0 and established higher demand regime, I choose default lead time so backend uses promised LT=0 and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base stock and cap. This balances service (capture higher sustained demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand position.

To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default=0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent demand regime. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the latest 5 weeks' demand pattern (responsive to recent variability) so the OR backend's base-stock balances profit vs holding cost under the confirmed lead-time=0 environment.

Demand regime shift from 2019-01-21 is already recorded; recent demand has trended lower vs mid-year peaks. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (captures late-summer/early-fall lower demand) so mu_hat reflects current regime and reduces overstock risk. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to align variability with recent weeks, letting the OR backend size safety stock appropriately given lower recent volatility and the 0 lead time.

Historical concluded periods show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0 across many periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21. No recent changepoint in demand mean/variance requiring adjustment. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) with current high on-hand inventory to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). SKU 610776033 has on-hand=216, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0). Recent demand has been moderate (recent weeks demand: 49,31,31,68,117,83,109,117...), and current on-hand covers multiple weeks. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples (scaled by 1+L) for mean and volatility; with holding cost >0 this avoids overstock while preserving service given confirmed zero lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=196, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has fallen (Periods 33-37: 117,68,49,31,49) \u2014 sustained lower autumn demand vs summer. Lead time historically confirmed 0; keep promised/default. Use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the recent downshift and avoid overstock: use last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend forecasts ~63 units review+lead. This keeps service level high (profit/holding -> q=0.8) while preventing excessive holding given large on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=169, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has dropped (Periods 35-38 demands = 49,31,49,27; recent avg ~39), so use a short recent window to capture current low regime. Set L to promised (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect current demand level over the review+lead window. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent lower volatility. These parameters reduce overstocking risk while maintaining service given confirmed 0 lead time and no in-transit stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent demand has declined sharply since early Oct (last 5 demands: 49,31,49,27,26) indicating a sustained lower regime. Lead-time history (many concluded arrivals same period) confirms 0 actual lead time. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (1+L multiplier applies); sigma_hat also recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding given profit/holding tradeoff and no in-transit stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled low (Periods 38-40 demands = 27,26,25), and historical concluded lead times remain 0 (confirmed earlier). To keep service high (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8) while avoiding excess holding, I use a short recent demand estimate. Set L to promised (default 0). Set mu_hat as recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-demand regime (mean \u224826 over last 3 weeks). Set sigma_hat as recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock focused on the near-term observed demand and prevents overstock given falling demand and zero lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has declined sharply since early Oct (Periods 35\u201341: 49,31,49,27,26,25,12), so forecast should reflect the low recent regime while promised lead time remains 0 and there are no in-transit units. On-hand=106 covers several weeks of current low demand; to avoid excess holding cost I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 periods (Periods 35\u201341), which captures the downward regime and keeps base_stock moderate to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (no recent lost shipments). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile weekly sales (last 3 concluded demands: 25, 12, 64), so I bias forecasts to the most recent short-run behavior. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed from the last 3 samples, improving responsiveness to the recent spike while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a pickup in the last two weeks (Period 42=64, Period 43=63) but prior Nov weeks were lower; to react to recent regime while avoiding overcommitment I use a short-window recent estimate. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (historical lead times consistently 0). Selected L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Chose mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the last 5 weekly demands (responsive to the recent uptick). Chose sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock. These settings increase target base stock modestly to cover the recent demand increase while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's newsvendor z*.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weekly demand has fallen from summer peaks to low levels in Oct\u2013Dec (recent demands: P38..P44 = [27,26,25,12,64,63,12]). On-hand=47, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand roughly covers one week of recent demand but leaves little buffer. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded history consistently. To keep service high (profit/holding -> q=0.8) while avoiding excess stock in this lower-demand season, I use a short recent-window forecast (last 7 weeks) and set lead time based on observed history.

No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior insights. To let the OR engine use full-sample statistics and the confirmed promised lead time, I choose default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and uses promised lead time.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while covering near-term lower demand, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to current lower-demand volatility and mean. This balances service level (cover next period demand) against holding cost given high on-hand stock.
