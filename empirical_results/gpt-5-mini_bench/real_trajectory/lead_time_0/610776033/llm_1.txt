  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date is 2019-02-11 (early Feb). No major holiday this week; seasonal transition from winter to spring can increase demand for lightweight T-shirts. Product: women's everyday basic T-shirt \u2014 likely to see steady weekday/weekend demand and rising demand into spring. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07:0, 2019-01-14:0, 2019-01-21:24, 2019-01-28:58, 2019-02-04:84 (weekly samples) \u2014 roughly +~30 units/week recently. Demand forecast: continue trend; expect order-of-magnitude ~100 units for upcoming period. Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised lead time=0 but actual lead time unknown; because arrivals are only visible in conclude messages and no prior arrivals exist, assume at least same-period arrival risk exists but be conservative and cover next period demand. Inventory decision: with profit $4/unit and holding cost $1/unit/period, expected margin per sold unit is high; understocking costs (lost profit) > holding costs. Order enough to meet expected demand while avoiding excessive holding. Final order: place 100 units to satisfy the rising weekly demand and provide a small safety buffer.",
