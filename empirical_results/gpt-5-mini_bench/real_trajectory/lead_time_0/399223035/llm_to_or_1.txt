Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5) show no clear changepoint or lead-time evidence; promised lead time is 0. Demand baseline set from full-sample stats to avoid overfitting given limited history. Using default methods keeps OR engine forecast consistent: base_stock derived from overall mean and std, balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean \u224877.4. Promised lead time is 0 and recent evidence supports same-period arrivals, so use the default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline base_stock that balances profit vs holding cost without overreacting to limited history or single-period noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed in P1 and P2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent sales were 78 and 91 units; historical sample mean=77.4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (avg=0) so the OR engine uses promised lead time=0. I use default demand and volatility scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps target base-stock near historical weekly demand (~77) to balance the 50% critical ratio (profit=holding) and avoid excess holding given zero pipeline and recent full sell-throughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Promised lead time = 0. Concluded history (Periods 1-3) shows all orders arrived with lead_time = 0 (consistent). Recent realized demand: 156, 124, 76; historical sample mean ~77.4 (2019 Jan samples). On-hand = 20, in-transit = 0 so we need to replenish for the next period. Given consistent observed lead_time=0 and limited evidence of a sustained demand regime change, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). Demand has dropped recently (Period2=124 \u2192 Period3=76 \u2192 Period4=64). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend confirm the observed lead_time=0 from concluded data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new, lower-demand regime (uses Periods 2\u20134 demands = 124, 76, 64). This keeps target base-stock aligned to the recent downward demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent 3-period avg = 88 (Periods 2\u20134) vs earlier samples higher (e.g., Period1 demand=156); sustained 3-period decline confirmed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent observed lead times (Periods 1\u20135 conclude) are all 0 \u2014 use average to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Demand has declined from early high values; the most recent 3 periods (P3\u2013P5) show a lower, stable regime (76,64,72 \u2192 avg \u224870.7). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 \u2014 with L=0 the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean; choosing recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the forecast on the new lower regime and reduces over-ordering/holding. Parameters chosen to lower target base-stock to match current demand while preserving service vs holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted lower vs earliest samples; last 3 demands (Periods 4\u20136 = 64,72,92) average ~76. To respond to the lower recent regime while keeping service vs holding balanced (profit=holding), I use the promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Concluded history shows all observed arrivals were same-period (lead_time=0 each concluded order), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (avg=0). Demand history (Periods 1\u20137: 156,124,76,64,72,92,130) shows variability but no NEW sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift, so use default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. No overdue or lost shipments detected; on-hand and in-transit are zero so defaults balance service-level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing shipments. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20138) consistently show arrivals same period (lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history is mixed without a clear, sustained new regime since the previous documented insight; therefore use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the engine derive base_stock and the capped order under the known profit/holding parity.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 72,92,130,113,107) shows a higher recent mean than earlier samples; to respond to this recent regime and reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in check, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 realized demands and their volatility). This biases orders toward current demand conditions and the OR backend will compute base stock accordingly.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows all prior orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 each concluded arrival). On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (Periods 1\u201310: 156,124,76,64,72,92,130,113,107,86) has variability but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. I set L using observed lead times (average = 0) so the OR backend treats same-period arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit/holding ($1/$1). This avoids overreacting to short swings while letting the OR engine pick the base-stock and cap.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P11 all arrived same period), so keep L=default. Recent demand shows no sustained drop; last 5 demands (P7\u2013P11 = 130,113,107,86,104) average ~108, so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture current level. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the base-stock to recent demand while avoiding overreaction to older samples; using recent statistics helps the OR engine balance service (profit=holding cost) given zero observed lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 8\u201312 demands = 113,107,86,104,140) shows current regime with mean \u2248110; I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target that recent average and avoid being pulled by older outliers. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 so z\u22480 and base_stock \u2248 mu_hat; using recent demand reduces stockouts while limiting holding. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility (~17.5) so the OR engine's cap and safety buffer are set from recent variability. No overdue/lost shipments detected.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent zero actual lead time (all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0). On-hand=13, in-transit=0, so no incoming units visible. Demand history is variable but shows no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline is empty; default settings balance service vs holding given profit=holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has shifted upward vs early-sample mean; last 5 concluded demands (P10\u2013P14) = [86,104,140,97,137], mean=112.8 and sample std used to capture recent volatility. Therefore: L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to focus the OR forecast on the recent regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has risen versus the earlier dip. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so use promised lead time (default). Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher demand regime (Periods 11\u201315 mean = 121.2 units; (1+L)\xd7mean with L=0 => 121.2). Volatility: use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base-stock around the recent higher mean while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed arrivals; they also respond quickly to the regime change given zero pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: recent 5-period avg = 121.2 (Periods 11\u201315) vs earlier 3-period avg = 88 (Periods 2\u20134); sustained increase confirmed (5 periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across all observed orders (no missing shipments), so use promised/default lead time. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime confirmed at Period 16, but this is already recorded; use backend defaults to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. Default choices keep parameters aligned with observed zero lead time and let OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and historical arrivals show consistent 0-period actual lead time. Set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead time consistently 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These params raise the base-stock to service the sustained increase while sigma from recent samples keeps safety stock aligned to current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Observed concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand has recently shifted up: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 14\u201318) = [137,128,102,112,114], recent 5-avg = 118.6 which is higher than the earlier 3-period low regime. On-hand=2, in-transit=0 -> very low cover for upcoming demand. To capture the sustained higher demand regime while keeping lead-time at the reliable observed value, I set L=default (promised lead time=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to base mu_hat on the recent 5-period mean (captures the confirmed 5-period increase). For uncertainty I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent lead_time=0 (no lost/delayed shipments). Recent demand (Periods 16-19 = 102,112,114,87; include Period 15=128) indicates a sustained higher regime versus early periods, so adapt to recent demand. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (5-period window balances responsiveness and noise). This ensures the OR backend targets service for current demand while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand has shown a higher regime since Period 11 (carry-over notes exist). Given reliable same-period arrivals historically and no current missing shipments, use promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the OR engine leverages full history while respecting the promised L=0. This balances service level (protects against recent higher mean via full-history mean) and holding cost via the backend's q-based z and cap.

Recent demand (Periods 17-21 = 112,114,87,54,76) shows a moderate average ~88.6 after the earlier regime increase detected at Period 16. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use promised lead time (default L=0) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to capture the post-change regime for both mean and volatility.

On-hand=5, in-transit=0 \u2192 low immediate buffer. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically (orders arrived same period), so stick with promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast that balances service (profit=holding cost) with inventory risk. This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run demand while letting OR engine apply its cap to limit excess inventory given holding cost parity.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324 = 54,76,84,89,38) shows a modest downshift vs earlier post-Period-16 regime, so use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to reflect current pace. Use default volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)) so OR backend retains full sample variability. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with current observed demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand has drifted down (Periods 21-25 demands = 76,84,89,38,53; recent 5-avg = 68), so I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the lower recent regime and avoid excess holding (profit=$1 vs holding=$1 favors conservative service level). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current mean and volatility over the latest 5 periods. These parameters give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored on the latest regime while keeping inventory lean given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened from the mid-May increase; last 5 demands (Periods 22-26) = [84,89,38,53,54], recent 5-avg \u224863.6. No overdue shipments observed (historical actual lead time consistently 0). I use default L to trust promised lead time=0, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to target a smaller base stock appropriate for current demand while still accounting for short-term variability.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 23\u201327) is noisy but shows no sustained (>3 periods) regime shift versus earlier history. Therefore use promised/default lead time and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock calculation balancing profit vs holding cost.

Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). All concluded history (Periods 1\u201329) shows orders consistently arriving with lead_time=0; on-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent demand has varied but there is no sustained new changepoint since prior notes. Use promised lead time (default L=0) so backend uses full-sample stats. Choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging all historical data and preserving stability given no new sustained signal. This keeps service-level sizing while avoiding unnecessary inventory with holding cost = profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand (Periods 26\u201330 = 54,79,61,45,53) averages ~58.4/week; on-hand=38, in-transit=0 so current cover <1 week at recent pace. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently, so use default promised L. To reflect recent regime (post mid-year normalization) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the most recent stable behavior and avoids older higher-variance samples). This balances service (targeting recent demand) versus holding cost by sizing orders to recent demand levels rather than long-term higher mean.

Historical observed lead times have all been 0 (orders concluded show lead_time=0). No evidence of lost shipments. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-summer regime (short recent window to react to the lower recent mean and volatility). This biases orders toward covering ~1 period of expected demand while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows demand variability and two previously recorded regime shifts (lower avg around Periods 2\u20134, then sustained increase confirmed by Period 16). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need normal replenishment. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L (promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the engine produce the base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given the provided reward ratio.

Recent demand (Periods 30\u201334 = 53,66,64,97,48) shows a current mean \u224865.6; recent volatility evident (std elevated). To react to the most recent regime while limiting exposure to stale data, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5). This keeps orders aligned with recently observed demand and the OR backend's base-stock calculation while the lead time remains confirmed at 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 66,64,97,48,45) shows a moderate recent-average of 64 units/week; using a recent-N forecast keeps orders responsive to the latest down/volatile pattern and limits holding cost given profit=holding. Therefore: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u224864. sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the current demand regime and account for zero observed lead time.

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduce excess holdings while preserving service. L kept as default (promised 0) to match observed arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand has been lower than earlier spikes; I detect no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shifts, so I use a recent window to capture current demand level. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target the (1+L)-period demand based on the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201338 avg \u2248 53.6). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility (std over Periods 34\u201338). These choices keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been lower and more stable than early-year spikes: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [45,41,56,78,58], recent 5-avg \u224855.6. All concluded lead times have been 0 (consistent). No new sustained regime shift beyond previously recorded insights. To keep service for the immediate weeks while avoiding excess holding, use a recent-5 demand estimate and recent-5 volatility. L uses the promised/default (0) since observed lead times are consistently 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand shows a moderate lower regime vs earlier high volatility; last 5 demands (Periods 36\u201340) = {41,56,78,58,40}, recent 5-week avg \u2248 54.6. Promised lead time historically 0 with consistent same-period arrivals; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime and reduce influence of older higher-demand weeks. Sigma is set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These parameters keep the OR base-stock focused on current lower recent demand while preserving safety from recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been moderate to low (last 5 demands: 56,78,58,40,41) with on-hand=14 and in-transit=0; no concluded late or lost shipments\u2014historical concluded lead times are all 0. I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages long-run estimates while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise and keeps ordering aligned with observed 0-period arrivals.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been lower than earlier in the year. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38-42) = [78,58,40,41,90], recent 5-avg = 61.4 which is materially below the long-run average. No evidence of lost shipments; historical observed lead time = 0 consistently. I set L=default (promised 0). To keep inventory aligned with the current lower demand regime and limit holding cost entering December, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 5 samples, improving responsiveness to the recent downward shift while keeping method conservative given limited recent volatility data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has fallen vs earlier in year; last 5 demands (Periods 39-43) = [58, 40, 41, 90, 19], mean=49.6. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=43, in-transit=0 so current stock slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean \u224849.6. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (historical concl. all 0). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent short-term demand level and avoid bias from older higher-demand periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility (including the 19 and 90 outliers). These parameters balance service (avoid stockout given current mean \u224850) while limiting holding cost amid a downward shift compared to earlier periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand shows some low weeks (Periods 43\u201344) but not a sustained 3+ period shift. I therefore use default lead time to match promised L=0 and default demand estimates using the full sample history so the OR backend's base-stock uses long-run demand mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to a short two-week dip and balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). Recent history includes confirmed regime shifts earlier (recorded previously) but no new sustained change in the last periods. Given zero pipeline and stable concluded LT=0, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical demand to compute base stock. This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the backend compute mean-based safety stock (q derived from profit/holding parity) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; supply currently zero in pipeline. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand is volatile around holiday weeks (Periods 42\u201346 demands = [90,19,26,89,72], 5-period avg \u224859.2). To capture the near-term post-holiday demand regime and avoid overstock, set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases orders on the most recent 5 weeks of data (captures holiday dip/spike pattern). This balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1) by reducing target base stock to recent observed demand.
