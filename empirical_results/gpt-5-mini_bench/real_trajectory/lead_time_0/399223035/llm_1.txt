Product: ladies high-waist jeggings \u2014 staple item with steady weekly demand. b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) = [57,73,88,73,96] \u2014 recent weeks average \u2248 81 with an upward tendency; use a short-term forecast near 90 units for next week. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals (if any) occur after decision and we have no confirmed LT, assume at least one period delay to be safe. e) Order logic: Balance service vs. holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1 per unit period \u2192 holding is expensive). Order to cover expected one-week demand with a small safety buffer for the slight upward trend. Recommend ordering 100 units.",
