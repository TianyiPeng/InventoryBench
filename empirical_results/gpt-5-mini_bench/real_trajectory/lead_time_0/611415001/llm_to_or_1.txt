Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 122 and std \u224821. With no evidence of a regime change and promised lead time defaulting to 0, use default methods so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (use all historical data) against holding cost given low holding relative to profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 with lead_time=0 (142 arrived), on-hand now 57, in-transit 0, no overdue shipments. Historical weekly samples (114,133,148,86,129) give mean=122 and std\u224821. No sustained demand or lead-time shift detected (Period 1 demand=85 is a single low week). I retain promised lead time (default) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using full historical mean) against holding cost; no explicit upward adjustment since no multi-period spike or trend is confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two confirmed same-period arrivals (Period1 arrived ordered P1, lead_time=0; Period2 arrived ordered P2, lead_time=0). On-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L=calculate to let backend compute average observed lead time (will be 0 given concluded data). Demand history provided (Jan weekly samples) and recent sells (85,113) show no sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time and modest on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals (Periods 1\u20133: arrivals for orders placed in same period), indicating actual lead time = 0. On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Use L=calculate to set lead time to observed average (captures confirmed 0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples\u2014this leverages historical weekly data while the confirmed lead time=0 keeps review+lead horizon short, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 order arrived P2; P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Profit: $360.00, Daily Holding Cost: $43.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical Jan samples show mean demand=122, but most recent concluded periods (P1-P4) show lower demand: [85,113,98,90], recent mean=96.5 (regime length=4). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods and on-hand=43, in-transit=0 so no incoming units expected. To avoid overstock given holding cost and lower recent demand, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the newer lower-demand regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Recent 5-week demand (Periods1-5) = [85,113,98,90,64], avg=90 \u2014 materially lower than older 2019 samples (avg=122). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To reflect the recent, sustained downward demand regime I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the current lower mean and volatility while L stays at the promised/default (0). This keeps orders responsive to the new lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped sharply over the last three concluded periods (Period 4-6: 90,64,61). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in past concludes, so use promised lead time. To adapt to the sustained lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 3-period regime (captures current lower mean) and estimate volatility from the same window. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given short lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand decreased from ~122 (historical sample mean 114,133,148,86,129 \u2248122) to 72 (Periods 4-6 avg 90,64,61 = 71.7), a drop of ~41%; sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 4: demands in P4-P7 = [90,64,61,48], recent average \u224865.8 units/week. On-hand=38, in-transit=0 so current inventory is below (1+L)*recent demand; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L to default to trust the promised 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime (regime length=4 -> N=4). For sigma I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating mean/variance from older high-demand samples and prompt replenishment to cover the lower recent demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=33, in-transit=0; confirmed lead time=0 from concluded history. Demand dropped at Period 4 and has stayed lower through Periods 4-8 (period demands 90,64,61,48,48 \u2192 recent avg ~62). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set lead time to promised (default) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 4-8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock around the current lower mean and observed volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (periods 4-9 demands = 90,64,61,48,48,32; recent avg ~58). On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so coverage is low vs (1+L) demand; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed 0-period lead time historically and sustained lower-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default) and estimate demand using recent samples to reflect the lower mean and volatility. I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 4\u20139) so the backend will reduce the base-stock and cap to avoid excess holding while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has fallen further: Periods 7-10 demand = [48,48,32,29], avg=39.25, below the earlier shifted mean (~71.7). On-hand=45, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pipeline coverage. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (use promised 0). To reflect the new low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the latest 4 weeks, reducing order targets and holding cost risk while maintaining service given low demand and zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand decreased from ~71.7 (Periods 4-6) to 39.25 (Periods 7-10), a further drop of ~45.4% sustained for 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: Periods 9-11 demands = [32,29,29], recent avg \u224830. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). To match the most recent regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples (captures the new lower demand). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while providing service for the current low-demand regime, and accounts for no in-transit coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg decreased from 39.25 (Periods 7-10) to 30.0 (Periods 9-11 avg = 32,29,29) \u2014 a ~23% drop, sustained for 3 periods (Periods 9-11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has moved to a lower regime (recent sold/demand: P8-P12 = 48,32,29,29,49) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals; use default promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (mean \u224837.4 for last 5 periods) and reduce overstating demand from older high samples. Sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service for the current low but variable demand while avoiding excess holding cost given no pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~30\u201350/week). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I use default L (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest low-demand regime (Periods 9\u201313) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the last 5 samples and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; this keeps target stock lean to limit holding cost given low demand and confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand has shifted down from earlier historical mean (~122) through multiple sustained drops (carry-over insights) but recent 5-period window (Periods 10-14 demands = 29,29,49,46,96) shows elevated volatility and a higher short-run mean versus the deepest trough. To balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and react to recent volatility while avoiding large inventory buildup, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent 5-week window to capture current mean and uncertainty. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand swings (including the spike at Period 14) without relying on long-ago higher averages.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has spiked (Periods 14-15: 96,122) after earlier declines. To protect against the recent surge while keeping holding cost in mind, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 11-15: 29,49,46,96,122). This captures the latest upward demand movement for the single-period review+lead window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 persistently; recent demand has been variable with a partial rebound since Period 12. No shipments overdue. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed concludes. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples Periods 12-16 = 49,46,96,122,69) to capture the recent rebound and volatility; this balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given limited on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0. Recent demand volatile with a spike in Period 15 (122) but last 5 demands (Periods 13-17 = 46,96,122,69,60) capture current regime; I weight recent data more while preserving some smoothing. Set L to default (promised 0). Use EWMA (gamma=0.4) for mu_hat to emphasize recent periods but dampen the single large spike. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture realized recent volatility (std \u224830). These choices aim to raise the target base-stock modestly to avoid stockouts from recent higher demand while keeping holding risk controlled (holding cost $1 vs profit $4 yields moderate service target).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 96,122,69,60,85) shows a sustained uptick over 5 periods vs earlier low regime; use a recent-window forecast to capture current mean/volatility. Set L=default (promised 0, historically confirmed). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new higher-demand regime and limit carry-over stock given holding cost (profit $4, holding $1). This balances service (respond to recent demand rise) while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand increased to ~86.4 (Periods 14-18 avg = 96,122,69,60,85) from prior ~30 levels (Periods 9-13); sustained for 5 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent demand has been in a higher, volatile regime since Period 14 (demands: 96,122,69,60,85,54). On-hand=53, in-transit=0; promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high service target (q\u22480.8). I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=0. I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-Period-14 regime (regime length=6) so the base-stock and caps reflect recent higher mean and volatility and avoid understocking given high profit/higher service level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed across many periods). Recent demand (Periods 16-20: 69,60,85,54,43) has average ~62.2 with moderate variability; this recent window captures the most recent regime after the mid-May spike and the subsequent normalization. I set L=default to use the promised (and empirically confirmed) 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand regime (N=5 is within the guidance: captures the most recent sustained pattern and balances recency vs sample size). With these choices the OR backend will target a base-stock tuned to current short lead time and recent demand, reducing excess holding while maintaining service given current demand levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8). Recent history shows consistently observed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals on same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Demand has experienced multiple regime shifts historically; most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21 = 60,85,54,43,110) show elevated mean with high variance and an isolated large spike at Period 21 that is not yet a sustained new regime. I therefore use promised lead time (default 0) and set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 5 samples to capture the current elevated level while keeping variance estimate responsive (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). These parameters bias ordering toward meeting near-term demand spikes while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (many periods). Recent two periods show high demand (P21=110, P22=129) but only 2 periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. No overdue/lost shipments. Choose L=default to trust promised/observed 0 LT. Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to tilt forecast toward recent high demand without overreacting to a 2-period spike. Use sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings keep service level responsive to recent uptick while controlling holding cost risk; no special handling for missing shipments needed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a return to higher demand since Period 14 with volatile weekly spikes (Periods 19-23 demands = 54,43,110,129,87; recent 5-week avg \u224884.6) so I bias forecast toward recent weeks rather than long-ago low regimes. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest regime (Periods 19-23) for mu_hat, and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base stock responsive to the recent uptick while limiting inventory carry since holding cost is material relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Recent demand has rebounded (Periods 20-24: 43,110,129,87,72) \u2014 short-term mean ~88. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the recent uptick while limiting noise from older low-demand regimes. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean and uses recent volatility for service-level sizing, balancing profit vs holding cost given current inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many periods P1..P25), so use observed average lead time. Recent demand has moved through regimes and most recently increased (Periods 14-18 and 21-25 show higher, volatile demand); to capture the current higher/volatile regime use recent 5 weeks (Periods 21-25) for mean and std. This raises the backend base-stock to protect service during the recent high-demand episodes while the capped order limit prevents extreme over-ordering given holding cost (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Recent weeks (Periods 21-27) show elevated and volatile demand (110,129,87,72,138,113,82) vs earlier low regime; no new sustained multi-week regime change beyond the recent spike. Use promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current higher mean and volatility from the last 7 demand observations (Periods 21-27). This keeps base-stock responsive to recent demand surge while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Lead time historically confirmed 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. To reflect recent higher demand and prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility and let OR compute base-stock accordingly.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period across many periods). Recent demand has rebounded from low-30s (Periods 9-13/14) to a higher regime in recent weeks (Periods 25-29 demands = 138,113,82,86,125; 5-period mean \u2248109). To match current regime and keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N N=5). This focuses orders on the current higher-demand regime and aligns base-stock with observed short-run mean/variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand has risen (Periods 26-30 demands = 113,82,86,125,131; recent 5-week avg \u2248107), so I bias the forecast to the most recent regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by history); set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean across the review+lead window; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This raises the base-stock and service level to reduce lost-sales risk while the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) ratio supports higher service (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8).

I choose default lead time to keep promised 0 (matches observed arrivals). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this leverages full history and the backend's capped ordering logic to balance the high service-level incentive (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

To balance service vs holding cost I use the recent 5-week demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reacts to the latest elevated/volatile demand while keeping L at the promised/default (0) supported by multiple concluded arrivals.

Recent demand is volatile with a high spike at Period 33 (163) but the last 5 periods (P30-P34) average ~98; using a short recent window captures current volatility and recent recovery vs older low-demand regimes. I set L=default to respect the promised/observed 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend targets a base stock reflecting the most recent demand regime and current variance, balancing service level (capture recent spikes) against holding cost given on-hand=62 and no in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 32-36 = 62,163,85,87,78) shows a higher short-run mean (~95) versus older low-demand regimes; to keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 weeks) and matching recent volatility. Keep L at default (promised lead time = 0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand has risen and become more variable since mid-2019 (last ~10 weeks include several large spikes), so I bias forecasts to recent data to avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs in mind. Set L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher mean and volatility over the last 10 demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use promised lead time. Recent demand shows high volatility and a recent uptick (P35-39 demands = 87,78,136,151,55); to capture current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and variability. High profit vs holding (q\u22480.8) warrants aggressive service level, so recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend size base_stock to recent conditions while avoiding stale long-term averaging.

Recent demand is variable; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) = [78,136,151,55,35], indicating elevated mean vs earlier low regime but high volatility. I set L=default to use promised lead time 0 (confirmed). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and uncertainty on the most recent demand regime, keeping orders responsive to recent spikes while reflecting current volatility to balance service level (profit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Recent demand is volatile with a sharp drop in the last several weeks (Periods 37-41 demands = 136,151,55,35,23); to adapt quickly to this new low/volatile regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 periods so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand and reduce excess holding. Using L=default (promised=0) keeps pipeline short and permits same-period replenishment; recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat balances service (capture recent mean) against holding cost by shrinking target inventory after the observed demand decline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclude history. To avoid overstock while meeting a high service target (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 high critical fractile), I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current low regime (N=4). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since concludes confirm 0. sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect recent lower volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arriving same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been low and stable: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43) = [55,35,23,46,23], mean \u224836.4 and moderate volatility. To keep inventory lean (holding cost $1 vs profit $4) I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 samples to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking. These parameters will shrink the base-stock and cap, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand has been lower than early-year peaks but elevated and somewhat volatile since Period 14; to reflect the recent multi-period regime (post-Period 14) I use a recent-window estimate. L set to promised (default 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the last ~20 demand observations (balances service level for $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while reflecting recent demand mean/variance and avoiding overreacting to single-week noise). This provides the OR backend with a demand forecast tied to the recent regime and a volatility estimate to compute an appropriate base-stock and cap.

Recent demand has been variable (last weeks include low 23,39 and a spike 117), so I use a recent-window estimate to capture current regime and recent volatility. I select recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 5 demand samples, balancing service for recent spikes while limiting holding cost. L kept as default (promised lead time = 0). No evidence of a new sustained regime shift requiring a carry-over insight.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time repeatedly confirms 0. Recent demand shows a sharp pickup in the last two periods (P45=117, P46=135) but variability remains high; to balance service vs holding cost I use a short recent window to capture the uptick while keeping exposure limited. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (captures last 5 demand observations: P42-P46 = 46,23,39,117,135) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over that recent window, increasing orders to cover the recent spike but reflecting volatility through sigma_hat.
