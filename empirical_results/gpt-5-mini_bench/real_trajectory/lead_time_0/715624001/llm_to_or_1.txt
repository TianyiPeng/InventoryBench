Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a sharp upward shift: samples = [37,22,53,215,302] with the last 3 weeks (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) averaging ~190 units/week vs earlier weeks average ~29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover elevated demand. I set L=default (use promised lead time=0 since no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (captures (1+L)*mean over the surge). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) so OR backend sizes safety stock to observed recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting the apparent surge while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: last 3-week avg = 190 vs earlier avg \u224829 (+\u2248554%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history shows a clear demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples avg=190 vs earlier avg\u224829). Period 1 conclude shows orders placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0), so promised lead time=0 is valid. Current on-hand=267, in-transit=0; with strong recent demand, keep higher forecast. Set L=default to use promised lead time=0. For mu_hat use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (3-week avg ~190, scaled by (1+L)). For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed demand increase while acknowledged holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=$19, holding=$1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (three-week high demand: 53, 215, 302 \u2192 avg ~190 vs earlier ~29). On-hand=226, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Confirmed actual lead time=0 in concluded periods. To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N (N=3) for both demand mean and volatility (focus on the 01-21..02-04 regime). L uses default (promised lead time=0). These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated short-term demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the OR backend cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1169.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/3/4. On-hand=275, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders from Periods 1\u20133 all arrived same-period (observed lead_times=0 consistently) so set L to calculated average (0). Recent realized demand (last 3 conclude demands = 131,131,76; mean \u2248112.7) is the best indicator for the upcoming review+lead period given the post-spike normalization; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime and volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current moderate demand while the confirmed L=0 ensures arrivals can meet same-period needs and avoids overordering given high on-hand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=227, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times in history are consistently 0 periods. Recent demand has fallen over the last 4 periods (131,131,76,48), indicating a downshift from the earlier spike. To reflect current regime I set lead time to the observed average and use a recent_N forecast (last 4 periods) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the recent lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has fallen from earlier spike: concluded demands/sales last 5 periods = 131,131,76,48,49 showing a downward shift after the spike. On-hand=178, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ample for near-term demand; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times (periods 1-3) = 0, so use calculated average lead time = 0. Demand forecast should react to the recent lower regime: use recent_N (N=3) on the last three concluded demands (76,48,49) giving a mean \u224857.7 for the review+lead period. Use recent_N for sigma to capture recent lower volatility. These choices lower target base stock versus the earlier spike, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=127, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in observed arrivals (Periods 1-3). Recent demand (Periods 4-6) = [48,49,51], indicating the Jan/Feb spike was temporary and demand has reverted to ~49 units/week. I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to target the current low regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 weeks \u224849) so orders replenish to service next-period demand without excess holding. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect lower current volatility and avoid overstating safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime reverted: recent Periods 4-6 avg=49 (48,49,51) vs prior spike avg\u2248190 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04); spike appears temporary.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical spike in Jan/Feb was temporary; recent periods (Periods 4-7) show stable demand ~49/week. Observed concluded lead times (Periods 1-3) = 0 \u2014 use calculated average. To avoid restocking to the past spike, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime: recent_N with N=4 (Periods 4-7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This biases orders to current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the recent demand level.

Observed concluded lead times (Periods 1-3 orders) are 0, so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times. Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-spike regime (last 5 periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock focused on the lower steady demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=34, in-transit=0 so coverage is limited vs (1+L)-period demand. Promised lead time history consistently concluded as 0 periods; use default promised L to let backend trust supplier. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent stable regime (Periods 4\u201310, length=7) to capture current lower mean and recent variability while down-weighting the earlier spike. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect realized volatility. These choices reduce overstocking from the earlier spike while maintaining service for current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demand has reverted to ~50/wk after a temporary spike in late Jan\u2013early Feb. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically. Use calculated lead time (avg observed = 0) so OR knows actual performance; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding given profit/holding costs and no strong new regime shift. This keeps ordering responsive to current ~50/wk demand while avoiding excess stock from the earlier short-lived spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (multiple periods with arrived units same period ordered), so I trust promised lead time. Demand spike in late Jan/early Feb was temporary and recent weeks reverted to lower levels; recent concluded weekly demands (Periods 8-12 = 52,51,19,87,129) best reflect current regime. To avoid overstock after the temporary spike, set L=default (promised 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest regime while smoothing variability. This keeps target base-stock aligned to current demand and limits holding cost given low holding cost sensitivity (profit/holding suggests moderate service level).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (no sustained delays), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has moderated but is variable; last 7 concluded demands (Periods 7-13 = 49,52,51,19,87,129,68) average ~65 units \u2014 use a recent_N forecast to capture the current regime and recent volatility. This balances service (cover current-week demand) against low holding cost by avoiding overreacting to earlier spikes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded arrival: lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent early-season spike (Jan 21\u2013Feb 04) reverted by Periods 4\u20137; demand since Period 4 has been stable around ~48\u201370. To let the OR engine compute the appropriate review+lead demand and volatility using the full sample set (while respecting observed 0 lead time), I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service (given current modest on-hand) against holding cost using observed historical variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 10-15) = [19,87,129,68,70,82], recent mean \u224875.8 and recent volatility notable. Spike in Jan-Feb was temporary and reversed by Period 7. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded lead times are 0. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture the current post-spike demand regime (mean \u224875.8) so base_stock matches recent demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock while avoiding overweighting the earlier spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=71, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders in Periods 1\u201316 all concluded with lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Demand spike in late Jan/early Feb was temporary and recent demand (Periods 9\u201316) is stable around ~55\u201382; I therefore forecast using recent data to capture the current regime. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0-period deliveries; mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 demand observations; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to estimate recent volatility. This keeps service targeted to current demand while avoiding carrying excess inventory from the prior short-lived spike.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has reverted to a lower steady regime (~48\u201382 units) after a temporary spike in late Jan\u2013early Feb. On-hand=75, in-transit=0 so immediate coverage is moderate. I set L=default (use promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0-period lead time consistently. For demand I choose recent_N with N=6 to capture the current post-spike regime (Periods 12\u201317 demands: 129,68,70,82,64,48 show the spike tapering into steady ~50s; using last 6 balances removing the Jan spike while retaining recent variability). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility rather than inflated historical variance from the earlier spike. These params bias the OR engine toward stocking for the current lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while keeping service for ~50/week demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has reverted from the Jan spike; last 5 weeks demand = {70,82,64,48,58}, mean \u224864.4. On-hand=65, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock roughly covers one-week expected demand. All observed lead times are 0 historically. To avoid overstock after the temporary spike I use the promised/default lead time and a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the current, lower regime; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This keeps base stock near one-week demand and limits holding cost while preserving service.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand has stabilized around ~50\u201380 units/week after an early Jan-Feb spike; all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (no delayed/lost shipments). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. I therefore keep promised lead time (0) and use the OR-default demand estimates so the backend's base-stock calculation uses the full-sample mean/variance while respecting observed 0 lead time and current inventory position.

Recent demand has reverted to ~50/week after Feb spike (carry-over noted), so use default demand estimate to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over all samples; default volatility likewise. This keeps orders conservative given healthy on-hand stock and low holding cost ($1) versus profit ($19), balancing service level and inventory cost.

======================================================================

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed in periods 1\u201321 arrived same period) so no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand shows no sustained new regime: last 6 demand observations (Periods 16\u201321) = [64,48,58,18,19,104], average \u224852.8 but with a single high spike (104) amid lower values \u2014 spike not sustained. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to make forecasts responsive to the recent, variable demand while not overreacting to one high week; this balances service (captures recent mean) against holding cost and handles potential short-term volatility. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments required.

Observed concluded lead times have been 0 historically, so use promised lead time (default). To balance service vs holding cost given high profit/higher target service level (q\u22480.95), I forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand mix (includes the spike but keeps recency), and set sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This yields a moderate base-stock that protects against the recent surge while not overstocking for the lower baseline.

Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (raises base-stock to protect service level); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (reduce lost sales) against modest holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21: avg demand Periods 21-23 = 168 vs prior long-run avg \u224860 (+\u2248180%), sustained for 3 periods.

Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 21 (Periods 21-23 avg=168) recorded in carry-over; last 3 demands (Periods 22-24 = 201,199,66) capture the most recent short-run regime and are used to set demand forecast. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default L. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current short-window demand regime and recent volatility; this biases orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while limiting holding cost given already-high on-hand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=173, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 21 (Period21-25 demands = 104,201,199,66,110; 5-period avg=136 vs prior long-run \u224850), so I bias forecast toward the recent regime. Observed lead times have been 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. Choose L=default to reflect supplier promise and stable historical confirmations. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods (captures the post-Period21 uplift) and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high for the new elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 21: Periods 21-26 demands = [104,201,199,66,110,208], avg=148 vs prior long-run \u224860. On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so pipeline is low relative to elevated demand. I set L=default because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (no evidence of lead-time drift). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 6 weeks to set (1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand variability; this raises safety stock but keeps cap constraint in mind. These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to satisfy higher demand while limiting excess holding by focusing on the confirmed recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 21 sustained through Period 26: avg demand Periods 21-26 = 148 vs prior long-run avg \u224860 (+\u2248147%), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 21: recent demands (P21-P27) = [104,201,199,66,110,208,322], recent 7-week avg \u2248173 vs prior long-run \u224860. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated regime. Set L=default (promised lead time=0; all concluded arrivals show 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime (regime length=7). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock to protect service during the sustained demand uplift while using recent variance to limit excess holding.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=233, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand history shows a sustained elevated regime starting Period 21 (Periods 21\u201326 avg \u2248148) but the last 3 weeks (Periods 26\u201328 = 208,322,83) are noisy and not a clear new sustained shift. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and ample on-hand inventory, I bias toward recent demand to maintain service through short-term volatility. Set L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=6) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime-length window (captures the elevated demand episodes from Periods ~23\u201328) so the OR engine targets higher base stock and accounts for recent volatility while avoiding overreacting to a single-week spike.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=262, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 24-29 = 66,110,208,322,83,63) shows elevated and volatile demand vs long-run; to react to recent regime while avoiding excess holding, I use a recent-N forecast (N=6) so mu_hat reflects the last 6 periods. Lead time kept as default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms 0. Sigma uses recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility for safety stock sizing. These parameters let the OR engine target a high service level (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while reflecting the recent demand spike and its volatility and avoid over-ordering from older low-demand periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=215, in-transit=0. Recent demand has returned to ~80-100/week after earlier spikes; last 3 observed demands = 83, 63, 97 (Periods 28-30) giving a short-term mean ~81. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so use default L. To keep inventory responsive to the current lower post-spike regime while reflecting recent variability, set mu_hat based on the last 3 weeks (recent_N N=3) and estimate sigma_hat from the same short window (recent_N N=3). This favors lower target stock than spike-driven long-run averages, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand.

Recent demand has reverted from mid-summer spikes to lower levels (last 4 demands: 83,63,97,17). To avoid overstocking while protecting service, I keep L as default (promised=0) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime using recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-spike demand level while smoothing a bit of variability. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=6 window to reflect current volatility.

Historical conclude messages show all arrived orders had lead_time=0 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 0; choose L='calculate' to reflect observed lead times. Recent demand has moderated after prior spikes; I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the latest regime (Periods 27-32) which balances capturing recent higher variability while smoothing older spikes.

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=203, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders that arrived: P1..P33 all W=0), so actual lead time confirmed as 0; no overdue or lost shipments visible. Demand recent volatility: Periods 28-33 demands = [83,63,97,17,34,84], recent mean=63 (6 periods) vs prior longer-run regimes noted in carry-over; spike in Jul/Aug was temporary but later sustained for several periods already captured. I select L by averaging observed lead times to keep promised=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (captures current volatile regime without over-weighting older spikes). These parameters instruct the OR backend to target a base stock tuned to recent demand (balancing service level vs. $1 holding cost and $19 profit) while avoiding overstock from prior spikes.

Recent demand elevated and variable; last 6 demand samples (Periods 32-37) show a higher recent mean (~104) vs long-run. Use promised lead time to match observed arrivals and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness (L=0 keeps review+lead horizon short). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent stable window.

Use a recent-window demand forecast to react to the latest regime while keeping lead time at promised value. Chose L=default to trust promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent uptick) vs holding cost by not inflating L or variance estimates.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Current on-hand=150, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so I use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 36-39: 117,160,93,81) is volatile but shows no new 3+ period sustained shift beyond already-recorded carry-over insights. I choose default methods so OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), which balances service level (profit $19) and low holding cost ($1) without overreacting to short spikes. This also avoids ordering into an empty pipeline (in-transit=0) unnecessarily given healthy on-hand stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods 35-40) shows a higher short-run mean (~114 units/week) versus longer-run variance; I therefore set demand forecast using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current regime and reduce risk of stockouts. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the current demand level while the backend's service-level cap limits extreme orders, balancing profit (high) vs low holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 36-41) shows a sustained higher regime (6-period avg \u2248108 units/week) vs earlier long-run; to protect service over the review+lead window I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=6) for both mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand and limits stockouts while containing holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=7, in-transit=0 => low immediate cover. Historical concluded lead_times are consistently 0, so keep L as promised (0). Recent demand shows elevated activity in late Nov (Periods 37-42: 160,93,81,104,95,148) \u2014short-term mean \u2248113.5/week\u2014so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current higher regime while limiting influence of older spikes. Using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat gives the OR engine a demand estimate focused on the most relevant recent weeks and keeps safety sizing responsive to current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts with only 7 on-hand) against holding cost by not using the long-run inflated averages from older spikes.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in concludes always W=0). Recent demand (Periods 38-43) appears to represent the current regime (demands: 93,81,104,95,148,65) so I use a recent_N forecast to focus the estimate on the most recent 6 weeks. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (and confirmed by concluded history). mu_hat set via recent_N (N=6) to capture current regime mean across the review+lead window. sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. These parameters keep replenishment responsive to the recent demand level while avoiding overweighting older spike/summer regimes or transient outliers.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 104,95,148,65,90) shows elevated but variable weekly demand vs long-run; to capture recent regime (post-Period 21 elevated regime that persisted) I use a recent-window forecast to weight recent weeks more heavily. Profit/holding implies very high target service level (q\u22480.95) so providing the OR engine a recent mean and recent std will raise base_stock appropriately while keeping safety-cap limits responsive to recent volatility. I choose recent_N with N=6 to cover roughly last 6 demand points (captures recent holiday variability without overreacting to a single spike). Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect recent volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage; recent demand elevated (Periods 40-45 = 104,95,148,65,90,233) suggesting higher short-term demand likely due to seasonality. Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded history consistently, so use default lead time. To capture recent uplift while keeping variance estimate grounded, I use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers last 6 demand observations). This gives the OR engine a forecast focused on the recent regime and balances service vs holding cost given zero pipeline.

No overdue arrivals to reconcile. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast (mu_hat) uses EWMA to emphasize recent demand while damping a short 2-week spike (EWMA gamma=0.3). Volatility uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains historical uncertainty. This balances service (captures recent uplift) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.
