Historical weekly demand (most recent 5 weeks): 20,14,19,18,18 => avg \u2248 18 units/week. No concluded arrival messages exist to infer actual lead time; supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual could differ. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage. Given high holding cost ($1 vs profit $4) avoid excess safety stock. Following decision rule to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand (using promised L=0) I order one week of expected demand (~18 units) to serve current period if supplier delivers same-period; this minimizes overstock risk if lead time is longer.",

Demand analysis: historical demand was low (~20s) then rose starting Period 27; recent periods show a much larger sustained spike: Periods 30\u201333 observed demand = 145, 152, 193, 594 (note Period 33 was censored by stockout: sold=165 but demand=594). Lead time: previously confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Ordering logic: with LT=0, orders placed now will arrive during this period and can meet immediate demand. Because recent true demand is very large and likely at least in the high hundreds (Period 33 demand=594), I place a large replenishment to avoid further lost sales while accepting some holding cost risk. Action chosen balances capturing high-margin sales ($4/unit) vs $1/unit/period holding cost.",
