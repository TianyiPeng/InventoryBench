Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly sales samples (Jan 7\u2013Feb 4: 20,14,19,18,18) show stable demand around ~18\u201319 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unobserved. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This is conservative given limited history and no evidence of regime change; default settings balance service vs holding cost until we observe concluded arrivals or sustained demand shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). Historical weekly demand samples mean=17.8, std\u22482.04. No sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by most recent arrival), default mu_hat => (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 17.8, and default sigma_hat => sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2248 2.04. These conservative defaults let the OR backend compute the base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) without overreacting to a single-period signal; on-hand + expected arrivals should cover the current period demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals: Period1 and Period2 orders both arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 twice) so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Use observed lead time average to match realized behavior and keep forecast based on all historical weekly samples (mean demand = 17.8 units). Chosen methods: L='calculate' to lock to observed lead time=0, mu_hat='default' to use (1+L)*mean(all samples)=17.8, sigma_hat='default' to use sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) (~2.28). These settings align the OR backend to current timely supply and historical demand, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders (Periods 1-3) all arrived same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history samples (provided) have mean ~17.8 units/week; recent realized weekly demand seen in concludes: 11,31,14 (some variability but no sustained regime shift). I therefore set lead time to use observed average (confirming promised 0). For demand I use the default historical aggregators so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level (uses long-run mean/volatility) while avoiding overreacting to the single high 31-week spike. These parameters keep orders aligned with observed 0-period arrivals and current on-hand to minimize holding cost versus lost sales risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [20,14,19,18,18], mean=17.8. On-hand=8, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Prior concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0). I set L to default (promised 0) and use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=17.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (covers typical weekly demand) while limiting holding cost given modest on-hand inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P5) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and weekly demand samples: [20,14,19,18,18], mean=17.8, sample std\u22482.04. On-hand=4, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded messages confirm 0. I use mu_hat=default so backend sets (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=1\xd717.8, matching recent realized demand. I use sigma_hat=default so backend sets sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)\u22482.04. These settings balance service (cover ~18 units expected weekly) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) across multiple periods. Recent demand has become more variable with two high weeks (31,34) but no sustained regime shift of 3+ periods; therefore use promised lead time and population averages. I choose L=default to keep lead time = promised (0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. Recent demand has stepped up: last 3 concluded demands = 19, 34, 38 (avg \u2248 30.3) vs earlier baseline (~18\u201320). I treat this as a sustained upward regime and use recent_N=3 to forecast demand over the review+lead period so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean. L uses default (promised 0, confirmed historically). sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the new higher demand while keeping holding cost awareness by limiting N to the minimal regime window supporting the shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has risen: last 5 period demands = [16,19,34,38,34], average \u2248 28.2 versus long-run mean ~17.8. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L as default (promised lead time=0). This raises target base-stock to improve service while the sigma estimate reflects recent volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has risen from ~18 in Jan to a sustained ~30s in recent weeks (Periods 5-9: 19,34,38,34,36). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 and lead time has been confirmed as 0. I use L=default (promised 0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime to capture higher recent mean/volatility: use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5-9) so the OR backend sets base_stock to reflect the ~32.2 weekly demand regime while sigma uses the same recent window to capture current variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand) versus holding cost by not inflating estimates with older low-demand data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P12) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and weekly demands: [20,14,19,18,18,34,38,34,36,26,16,32] with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 entering this period. No signs of lost shipments or sustained regime change; use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service level (maintain coverage for current weekly variability) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0). On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (concluded demands) appears stable around ~18 units/week. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed observations. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine set the base stock and cap using full historical demand while penalizing holding cost via its q formula. This keeps ordering aligned with observed zero lead time and stable demand, avoiding unnecessary inventory buildup given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical weekly demand samples (5 values from Jan 2019) and extensive concluded history show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Current on-hand=14, in-transit=0; recent weeks demand varied but long-run samples represent baseline. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded messages confirm 0 and no overdue shipments. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost using the backend's base-stock formula without overfitting to short-term noise.

Use default L to trust promised lead time=0 so orders arrive same period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this balances service level (cover ~17.8 units/week demand) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in prior conclude messages) and no sustained demand regime shift; recent weeks' demand fluctuates but centers near historical mean. Given stable lead time and ample history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances a relatively high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding manual over-adjustment for short transient demand swings.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 .. 2019-02-04) show mean ~17.8/week; recent concluded history through Period 24 confirms frequent same-period arrivals and stable lead time. Current on-hand=23, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use default lead time (promised=0) because multiple concluded periods confirm actual L=0. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, providing a straightforward baseline forecast that balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. This conservative choice avoids overfitting to short-term variability and leverages confirmed lead-time reliability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent conclude history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed in Period 4 and repeatedly thereafter). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Profit $4 vs holding $1 gives high target service level (q=0.8) so backend should target higher base-stock; because lead time is reliably 0 and no sustained demand regime shift is evident, use default lead time and default demand estimates (use all historical samples). This balances service (avoid stockouts given high profit) while letting OR backend apply caps to limit over-ordering.

I choose L='default' to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded history is stable. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this leverages full demand history to set base-stock while keeping calculations consistent given the confirmed 0 lead time and recent stockout signal.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over). Recent demands show large variability including two stockouts with high demand (P26 demand 36 sold 27; P27 demand 67 sold 28). Given confirmed same-period arrivals, use promised lead time (default) so OR backend treats L=0. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all data while letting the OR engine set service level from cost ratio (profit=4, holding=1). No explicit adjustment for spikes to avoid overfitting to two recent outliers.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks (Periods 26-28) show large spikes (demands 36,67,68) but these appear as short surges; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed Period 4 insight). I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost by relying on full-sample statistics while acknowledging zero observed lead time. No evidence of a new sustained regime change that warrants switching to recent_N or explicit forecasts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand surge starting Period 27 (demands 67,68,59) vs prior periods (Periods 1-26 mean \u224820). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 weeks) to capture the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the confirmed recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: prior avg (P1\u2013P26)=~20 units/week \u2192 recent avg (P27\u2013P29)=64.67 units/week (+224%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 0. Demand regime changed starting Period 27: recent periods P27\u2013P30 show a sustained high-demand regime (P27\u2013P29 avg \u224864.67, P30 demand=145) lasting \u22653 weeks. To avoid stockouts during this new high-demand regime, keep lead time at promised (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (covering P27\u2013P30) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, increasing order targets to balance service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4/Hold=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand jumped sharply starting Period 27 (P27\u2013P31 show very high weekly demand vs prior ~20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded P1\u2013P31). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (use last 3 weeks: P29\u2013P31) to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping sample window minimal and responsive. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices raise the base stock to cover the sustained higher demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand weeks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained, large demand regime shift beginning Period 27 (P27\u2013P32 elevated). Promised lead time = 0 and past concluded messages confirm 0 lead time; use default for L. To capture the new demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering P27\u2013P32). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect increased volatility in the same window. These settings push the OR engine to raise base-stock to meet the much higher recent demand while sigma_hat increases safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: prior avg (P1\u2013P26)=~20 units/week \u2192 recent avg (P27\u2013P32)=114 units/week (+470%), sustained 6 periods (P27\u2013P32).

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (P27\u2013P33 shows dramatically higher weekly demand vs P1\u2013P26). I set L to default (promised lead time=0, confirmed). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 periods P27\u2013P33) to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base_stock on the recent elevated mean and volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand regime (since Period 27) is much higher: last 8 period demands = [67,68,59,145,152,193,594,147], mean=178.125/week. On-hand=195, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~1 week at recent rates; risk of stockout if demand persists. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. To capture the confirmed regime shift (sustained since P27) I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets base-stock appropriate for the new higher-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand periods. No new shipment-loss signal detected.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=162, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand regime has been elevated since Period 27; to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variation, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 demand samples (Periods 30\u201335). This provides the OR backend a (1+L)-scaled recent mean and recent volatility to size base-stock for high service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) while avoiding overreaction to the single extreme spike in Period 33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand regime is elevated since Period 27 (sustained high weekly demand P27\u2013P36). On-hand=267, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for several weeks but demand remains volatile (big spike at P33). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior confirms. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (captures P27\u2013P36 recent regime average while smoothing single extreme), and sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance; keeping L=default avoids inflating pipeline for a confirmed same-period lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=136, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 (arrivals same period). Demand has shifted upward recently: P34\u2013P37 demands = [147,164,116,166], avg=148.25 over 4 periods, ~30% above prior confirmed regime (P27\u2013P32 avg=114). I set L=default to keep promised/confirmed lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt the forecast and volatility to the new, sustained higher-demand regime (4 periods) so the OR backend raises base-stock and maintains service while limiting excess holdings given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: prior avg (P27\u2013P32)=114 units/week \u2192 recent avg (P34\u2013P37)=148.25 units/week (+30%), sustained 4 periods (P34\u2013P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): recent demand remains at the elevated regime established from Period 34 onward (recent demands P34\u2013P38 avg \u2248146.4/week). On-hand=29, in-transit=0, lead-time historically confirmed 0. To align the OR base-stock with the new higher demand while limiting excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 5-week regime (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility (stable elevated regime). This provides mu_hat reflecting (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat reflecting recent volatility, improving service for the new regime without overreacting to older low-demand history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in history). Recent demand regime elevated vs. early history; the most relevant data are the last 6 weeks (Periods 34\u201339) which capture the post-regime-shift demand pattern including the peak then recent softening. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the most recent regime (balances service level for elevated demand while avoiding overstating long-term mean given earlier low-demand periods). No new sustained changepoint detected to record.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand regime elevated since Period 34 (sustained higher weekly demand). Current on-hand=81, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (confirmed L=0 historically). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 34\u201340, length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean/volatility and avoid dilution by the much lower earlier baseline. This keeps target base-stock responsive to elevated demand while containing holding cost given on-hand stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand experienced large, sustained increases starting Period 27 and further shifts through Period 34\u201337; recent weeks (Periods 36\u201341) show a new mixed but elevated regime vs pre-Period-27. To capture the current elevated short-term demand while relying on confirmed lead time=0, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent demand regime (Periods 36\u201341) so the OR backend's base-stock reflects current higher demand and avoids understocking given zero lead time and zero in-transit. No indication of lost shipments, so explicit lead-time extension is unnecessary.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=102, in-transit=0; no arrivals outstanding and no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/observed L=0. Demand experienced multiple upward regime shifts earlier (large jump from ~20 to >100 in Aug\u2013Sep) and recent weeks show a lower but still elevated weekly demand (Periods 37\u201342 demands = 166,139,73,83,74,39). To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 weeks (N=6) to reflect the current demand regime while avoiding overreaction to a single low week. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent trend while limiting excess inventory buildup.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent demand has declined from the Sept\u2013Oct peaks; on-hand=113, in-transit=0 so immediate coverage is ample. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). To reflect the recent lower demand profile (last 6 weeks P38\u2013P43 mean ~71.8) while keeping responsiveness to short-term volatility, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) so the OR backend builds base stock for the current short-run demand regime and keeps safety stock aligned with recent variance. This avoids over-ordering given high on-hand while maintaining service (profit/holding implies high service level).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (multiple confirms P1\u2013P44). Recent carry-over insights record earlier demand regime shifts (P27\u2013P37) but the last two concluded weeks (P43=23, P44=11) are only 2 periods and do not yet constitute a sustained new regime. To let the OR engine use its full-sample estimates and because lead time is confidently observed as 0, I choose default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on all samples. This balances service level (uses long-run elevated demand signals) versus holding cost while avoiding overreacting to a short 2-week dip.

Demand has been volatile recently with a large spike in P45 (demand=156) but mixed weeks prior. To balance service (avoid stockouts on spikes) while controlling holding cost, I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets inventory reflecting the most recent 6 weeks' demand pattern including the recent surge.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since the changepoint at Period 34 (evidence: P34\u2013P46 form a 13-period higher-demand regime vs earlier baseline). To prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1) I keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes) and set demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime. Therefore I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (the length of the confirmed recent regime) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and caps to cover the current elevated demand while balancing holding cost.
