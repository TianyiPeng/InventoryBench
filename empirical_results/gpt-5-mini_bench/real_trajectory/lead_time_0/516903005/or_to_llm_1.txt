OR base-stock cap recommends 32 using promised lead time and historical averages. Decision logic: because lead time = 0, orders immediately satisfy current-period demand; with profit $4 and holding $1 the critical fractile favors stocking (q=0.8) but holding cost still penalizes large overorders. I therefore moderately increase OR's recommendation to cover the possibility of another high-demand period while limiting holding exposure.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), so any order placed now will arrive during Period 47 demand window. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=15, in-transit=0. Recent true demands (from concluded periods) show a sharp holiday spike: P43=23, P44=11, P45=156, P46=145; recent 4-period average \u224883.8, but two very large periods (P45\u2013P46) imply elevated demand risk for this week. OR recommends 127 units using historical baseline; with L=0 the OR cap/stock calculation already targets same-period demand plus safety. Given confirmed zero lead time and recent elevated demand (and potential left-censoring in P45 when inventory constrained), I will follow the OR recommendation to avoid stockout over the holiday week. Final strategy: order 127 units (arrives same period), which with on-hand 15 yields 142 available to meet expected high demand while accepting moderate holding cost if demand falls after the season.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 127 units\u2014lead time is confirmed 0 and recent holiday-period demand (P45\u2013P46 large) justifies OR's higher recommendation to avoid stockouts.",
