Trend shows a rise in Jan with slight softening; combine with a small Valentine uplift => point forecast \u2248 40 units for Period 1. Lead-time & arrivals: Supplier promised lead_time=0; with promised 0 the order placed now should arrive during this same period (so it can meet Period 1 demand). No concluded arrival history exists yet to contradict promised lead time. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must order to meet expected Period 1 demand. Order logic: Balance profit ($4/unit sold) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period) by targeting expected demand (minimizes leftover holding cost while meeting demand and capturing profit). Place order equal to forecasted demand to meet Period 1 expected sales without building excess inventory.",
