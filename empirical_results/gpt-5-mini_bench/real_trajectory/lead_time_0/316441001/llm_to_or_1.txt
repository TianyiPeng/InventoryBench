Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales samples: [102,89,87,148,148] -> mean \u2248115. No on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time used (default). Use default demand/statistics (all samples) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; with profit=holding the service-level q=0.5 (z=0) this keeps base-stock near the empirical demand while avoiding speculative adjustments without more evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Latest conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~114.8 and no sustained changepoint. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). I use default demand estimates (1+L times mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with historical demand while avoiding overreaction to a single high recent week. This balances service level against holding cost given profit = holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25: recent observed demands show variability with two higher demands (82 then 138) on top of Jan samples. Both concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time=0 so far. To keep the policy responsive to the recent uptick, set L by calculating observed lead times; set demand forecast using the most recent 5 samples to capture recent regime while smoothing older Jan data; set sigma using recent 5-sample volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean ~120.6) vs holding cost by not overreacting to a single period spike.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P1=82, P2=138, P3=106 \u2014 recent mean ~108.7 and higher variability than older Jan samples. All three concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To reflect the confirmed short lead time and recent demand regime, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), mu_hat via recent_N with N=3 to focus forecast on the last three periods, and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost by using recent demand-driven base stock and recent volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3).

Daily Profit: $60.00, Daily Holding Cost: $49.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; recent demand has been variable (concluded demands: 82,138,106,60). Profit and holding cost equal ($1/$1) imply q=0.5 (moderate service/holding tradeoff). With no sustained demand regime change (drop to 60 in P4 is single-period) and confirmed lead time=0, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and uses promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent observed weekly demand (P1-P5) = [82,138,106,60,63], on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, so use promised/default L. To capture the most recent regime and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples across the (1+L) review+lead window). This balances service (captures recent high demand spikes like 138) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-ago January samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=26, in-transit=0; recent concluded weekly demand shows a downshift (last 3 demands: 60,63,64) vs earlier higher weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. To avoid overstock while meeting near-term weekly demand, use promised/confirmed lead time and base forecasts on the most recent regime. L uses default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of 60,63,64). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce excess safety stock (lower holding cost) while keeping service for the current low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P7) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. Demand has shifted: earlier high volatility (P1\u2013P3) then a stable lower regime (P4\u2013P7) around ~60 units/week. To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and the recent lower/stable demand, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 weeks (captures the new regime and reduces overstock risk). This reduces target base-stock versus using all historical high-demand samples, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~60-64 units in Periods 5-8) versus earlier higher winter demand. On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and prior conclude messages confirm lead time = 0. Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent demand (last 4 periods, P5-P8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduce overstocking risk given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand has been stable around 50\u201364 units (most recent demands: 82,138,106,60,63,64,60,61,50 with on-hand=12, in-transit=0). Carry-over confirmed lead time=0 earlier; no new lead-time evidence. I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample statistics given stable recent demand and avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while the pipeline is empty.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has averaged moderately (~50-80/week) with ending on-hand=56 and in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concludes show consistent lead time=0. To balance $1 profit vs $1 holding, use the backend defaults which target (1+L)*mean demand and sqrt(1+L)*std uncertainty with promised lead time. Using default L/mu/sigma leverages all history and the confirmed same-period arrivals to produce a stable base-stock recommendation while avoiding excess holding given low unit profit margin.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrived same period). Demand history shows weekly variability but no recent sustained regime shift. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit and holding ($1 each). This keeps policy responsive to the confirmed same-period arrivals and observed demand dispersion.

No evidence of sustained demand regime shift (recent demands stable around historical samples). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed operations and minimize holding costs while meeting service targets, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed) and stable weekly demand around mid-40s with a recent uptick (last demand samples: 41,34,43,47,63). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 \u2192 low cover going into this period. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. For demand forecast I focus on the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to capture the recent increase; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets service for the current higher short-term mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts with low on-hand) against holding cost by not over-weighting older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-16) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2014 confirmed stable lead time=0. Profit and holding cost are equal, so target service level implies base_stock \u2248 demand forecast. No recent changepoint in demand (weekly demands in history stable), and there are no overdue shipments. Use promised/default calculations so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=1. This balances service vs holding given no new evidence and low current on-hand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose default lead time to trust confirmed 0-period behavior, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting short fluctuations.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded shipments confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals every period). Demand history available is the seeded samples; no recent sustained demand regime change detected. To let the OR engine use its default estimators (which use all samples and confirmed L=0) I select default lead time and default mu/sigma so base-stock is computed from full-sample mean and std. This keeps ordering aligned with observed stable demand while avoiding unnecessary extra holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has dropped sharply in the last 3 weeks (Periods 17-19: 23, 16, 5), suggesting a new low-demand regime; this is 3+ periods so I treat it as a sustained shift. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower recent mean and volatility and thus reduce ordering compared to using the long-run mean.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has fallen markedly: Periods 16-20 demands = [40,23,16,5,6], on-hand=59, in-transit=0, confirmed lead time=0 (carry-over). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent lower volatility. This keeps base_stock tied to recent lower demand, reducing holding costs given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 (2019-07-01): avg demand dropped from ~50 (Periods 7-15) to 18 (Periods 16-20), \u221264% (evidence: P16-20 demands = [40,23,16,5,6])

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent data show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 (weekly demands around 5\u201340, recent values [40,23,16,5,6,18]). On-hand=41, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0, so use default L to let backend assume same-day arrivals. To capture the recent demand drop, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 weeks including the new low regime) so the forecast and safety stock reflect the lower mean and observed variability; this reduces excess ordering and holding cost while preserving service. No evidence of lost shipments to account for.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 16 with particularly clear drop noted at Period 21; current on-hand=21, in-transit=0 so we must avoid excess holding. Keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0) so use L=default. For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent low-demand regime to capture the new mean: recent_N with N=7 (Periods 16-22) to compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 7 samples). Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=7) to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce ordering to align with the sustained lower demand and minimize holding cost while preserving service.

Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained demand drop starting Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time = 0 and prior concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0, so use default lead time. To respect the new low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent data since Period 21: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (captures Weeks 21-23 demand = [18,20,13]) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service for the new regime.

Lead time remains confirmed as 0 historically, so use promised lead time. To capture the post-Period-21 lower demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime length = 4).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1-P25 conclude messages). Demand dropped starting Period 21 and recent weeks remain low (P21-25 demands = [18,20,13,4,10], recent mean \u224813). To avoid excess holding cost while meeting current low demand, keep lead time = default (promised 0, confirmed), set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new low-demand regime (N=5 -> (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. This biases orders toward the lower post-change demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand regime dropped at Period 21; recent weekly demands (P22-26) = [20,13,4,10,11], recent mean \u224811.6. With no pipeline and low recent demand, set L to promised (default=0) and base forecast using recent 5 samples to capture the post-shift regime; use recent 5 for sigma to reflect current volatility and avoid overstock. This balances service (cover ~current weekly demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/19 (Period 28). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1..P27). Demand regime dropped around Period 21 and recent weeks show low demand (Periods 21-27 demands = [18,20,13,4,10,11,11], recent mean \u224812.43). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to default (promised = 0) and forecast demand using recent data: use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the post-change low-demand regime, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to the lower demand regime and reduces overstock risk given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 (avg drop previously documented). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must forecast from recent low-demand regime. Lead time historically confirmed as 0; keep promised lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the post-Period-21 regime (use last 8 weeks: Periods 21-28 demands = [18,20,13,4,10,11,11,20]) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean of these. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=8 to reflect current volatility. These choices adapt base-stock to the lower demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5), while ensuring enough inventory to serve the reduced but consistent demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1..P29 confirms). Demand regime dropped around Period 21 and recent weekly demands remain low/moderate (most recent demands P24-P29 = [4,10,11,11,20,19]). To reflect the post-shift regime I use recent samples for demand forecast: set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded history) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the lower recent mean while capturing recent volatility. N=6 chosen because the recent low-demand regime spans these 6 most recent concluded observations (regime_length=6), satisfying the recent_N rule (N between 3 and 20). This balances avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (many confirmed arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted down at Period 21; recent demand (P21\u2013P30 = 10 samples) is the relevant low-demand regime. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-shift regime (covers P21\u2013P30) so the OR engine sizes base-stock for the lower average and its volatility, limiting excess holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed P1->P1..P31->P31), so use default promised L=0. Demand experienced a sustained downward regime beginning Period 21 (2019-07-01); recent periods (P21\u2013P31) show lower average and should drive the forecast. I select recent_N with N=11 (periods 21\u201331) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive. This reduces overstating mean demand (lower holding cost exposure) while preserving service via variance-informed safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (multiple P->P arrivals). Demand regime shift at Period 21 to a lower mean is sustained (Periods 21-32 show consistently low weekly demand). To react to the sustained lower-demand regime while avoiding stockouts (current on-hand=0) I use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent regime: use the last 12 samples (Periods 21-32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This anchors the base-stock to current lower demand and lowers excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 (confirmed earlier), but recent weeks include a single large spike at P33 (demand=98) likely an outlier. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), I set L=default (promised 0). I forecast demand using recent_N over the most recent regime to adapt to the lower-demand level while still reflecting recent variability: mu_hat recent_N N=12 (uses last 12 demand samples across the (1+L) review+lead window). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=12 to capture recent volatility but limit influence of the single spike. This keeps base_stock responsive to current lower-demand regime and avoids overstocking from the P33 outlier.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No overdue/lost shipments observed; historical concluded lead times confirm 0. Recent demand has spiked in the last 5 weeks (Periods 30-34 demands = [13,15,17,18,25] in earlier snapshot but more recent full history shows 17,41,26,98,93 for Periods 30-34), so I bias the forecast to recent data to capture this surge. Set L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR engine target a higher base stock reflecting the recent demand surge while keeping variability based on the same recent window.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped since Period 31 (demands P31-35 = [41,26,98,93,75]); this suggests a new high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-35). To react quickly to the recent spike while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time (default=0) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (capturing the spike). Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises target base-stock and safety stock to meet elevated demand without overcommitting to long-term averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg demand increased from ~15.6 (P26-30) to 66.6 (P31-35), +327% (evidence: P31-35 demands = [41,26,98,93,75])

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To react to the higher recent demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to capture increased volatility. This addresses missing inventory by forcing replenishment sized to recent elevated demand while keeping L at promised (0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 31 (multiple weeks of 41,26,98,93,75,77,79 sold) so I treat demand as shifted upward. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 \u2014 use calculated average. To capture the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covers Periods 31\u201337) so the OR engine sizes base stock to the new demand level while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple P1->P1 through P38->P38 arrivals). Demand regime increased starting at Period 31 (P31-38 demands = [41,26,98,93,75,77,79,90]), so I focus the forecast on this recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the 8-period high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This concentrates inventory to meet the higher current demand while holding cost equals profit, so using recent data balances service level and inventory cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (sustained through Period 39). Demand regime since Period 31 is high (P31-39 demands: [41,26,98,93,75,77,79,90,68]) \u2014 recent high-volume regime persists. To match current regime and keep service with minimal holding (profit=holding), I use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility (captures latest 5-week average ~77.8). Keep promised lead time (default=0) since concluded history confirms 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (P1->P1 ... P40->P40), so use promised lead time. Demand regime increased starting P31 (sustained high weekly demand P31-40); I treat the recent high-demand regime as current. To focus the forecast on the current regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 (P31-40) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture volatility in the same window. These parameters prioritize service (protect against stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime) while L=default avoids inventing lead-time risk given confirmed 0-period arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 31 (observed P31\u2013P41 high weekly demand; recent weeks P39\u2013P41 = [68,86,71]). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient against the high-demand regime. All concluded lead-times = 0, so use observed lead time. To capture the post-Period-31 regime I set demand estimators to use the recent regime length (11 weeks, Periods 31\u201341) so \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the higher mean and volatility. These parameters increase the base-stock to prioritize service (profit and lost-sales avoidance) while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-42) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Recent demand has a pronounced high-volatility holiday spike (Period 42 demand=182) but overall history includes multiple regime shifts; however the confirmed sustained shifts are already recorded in carry-over. To let the OR engine use its full historical stats while honoring confirmed lead time=0, I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level during the holiday spike by relying on full-sample variability rather than overfitting a short spike, while keeping parameters aligned with observed 0-period lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods. Demand shifted up starting Period 31 and the most recent regime runs P31\u2013P43 (13 weekly samples) with substantially higher mean and volatility vs earlier data; I therefore use recent_N over that regime so the backend base-stock reflects current higher demand and variability while keeping L=promised (0). This balances service (reduce stockouts during the elevated regime) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfilment (lead time 0). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile holiday/weekend spikes (last 5 concluded demands: 86,71,182,42,46) so I bias forecast to the recent regime to protect service during peak season while accepting holding cost tradeoff. No overdue/lost shipments to account for. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current high-variance holiday demand pattern.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=28, in-transit=0, no arrivals pending. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand has shifted to a higher, volatile regime since Period ~31 with a notable spike at Period 42 (182). To capture the current high/volatile demand pattern while limiting sensitivity to single-week outliers, I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses the last 10 observed weekly demands to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (captures recent uplift) against holding cost by focusing on the most recent regime rather than long-ago low-demand periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals firmly confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1->P1 .. P46->P46). No new sustained demand regime change (recent holiday spike at P42 was a single large week). To be responsive to recent demand volatility around holiday weeks, set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture latest mean/variance (last 5 weeks: P42\u2013P46) so the OR backend raises target stock for short-term elevated demand while limiting longer-term holding cost exposure. No evidence of missing shipments requiring explicit lead-time extension.
