Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean=37 units/week, recent values stable (28,38,34,44,41). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no observed lead-time data yet. Promised lead time=0; use default lead time. Use default demand estimates (1+L)*mean to reflect observed average demand and default volatility from sample std to let OR backend set service level given profit/holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent sale: Period1 demand=43 leaving on-hand=5, in-transit=0. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change; single arrival in Period1 matched promised lead time (0). Keep lead time estimated from observations (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend uses full-sample historical mean (mean=37 weekly) and std. This balances service (cover typical weekly demand) vs holding cost given low holding cost and limited on-hand/pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show lead_time=0 for P1 and P2 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; stockout risk is high given recent demand surge (P1 demand=43, P2 demand=66) versus historical weekly mean=37. I trust observed lead_time=0 (use default promised lead time). Demand appears elevated recently but only 2 periods of higher demand \u2014 not yet a sustained 3+ period regime shift, so I use an EWMA to upweight recent demand while retaining historical information (gamma=0.5). Volatility estimate kept as default to reflect full-sample variability. These choices raise the base_stock to cover higher recent demand while keeping sigma conservative for the OR capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1066.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands (Periods1-3) = 43, 66, 57; on-hand=17, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically. Pipeline is empty, so current available stock (17) must cover upcoming period demand. I detect a sustained upward demand vs. earlier Jan samples (mean ~37 -> recent mean ~55). Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period lead_time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 3 demands \u224855.33); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher base stock) given clear recent demand increase while keeping variance estimation recent to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical mean (2019-01 samples)=37 units/period vs. recent mean (Periods1-3)=55.33 units/period (+49.5%); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $805.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand has shifted up vs. historical (sustained ~3 periods). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand after decision. I set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (use the last 3 demand observations). Sigma likewise uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new regime to raise service while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's q-based safety stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand (Periods 1-5 concluded) averaged 50.6 units/period (demands: 43,66,57,44,43), higher than the older Jan samples; on-hand=31, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived same period). I therefore set L via observed lead times (calculate). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 5 periods. This raises the base stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while keeping variance driven by recent data to avoid excessive holding costs given holding=$1/unit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent weeks (Periods1-6) show sustained higher demand vs. Jan historical baseline (recent mean ~54 vs. historical 37; prior carry-over recorded). All observed lead times have been 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus replenishment risk. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated, sustained demand regime from the last 6 periods so the backend increases base-stock and reflected variability, balancing higher service level versus holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0), so set L to calculated average to confirm. Recent demand has shifted up vs. the Jan baseline; last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 3-7) show elevated and more volatile demand (57,44,43,73,98) \u2014 I use recent_N=5 to capture current regime for both mean and volatility so the OR base-stock will target higher availability while capping order size. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by focusing safety stock on recent elevated demand and using observed lead time=0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs historical Jan samples (recent 5 demands = 44,43,73,98,72 \u2192 mean ~66). On-hand=29, in-transit=0, so current pipeline cannot cover the expected (1+L)-period demand; choose parameters that reflect the recent high regime. Set L=default (promised 0; observed lead times have been 0 in concluded history). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to avoid lost sales while keeping holding cost consideration via the backend service-level formula.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand elevated vs. historical Jan samples; last 6 demand observations (Periods 4-9) show higher mean and volatility. On-hand=35, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (consistent observed lead_time=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes; this yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility that let the OR engine raise the base stock to improve service while capping orders to limit holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19 favors service but with restraint).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201310), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand is in a higher regime: last 5 demands (Periods 6\u201310) = [73,98,72,69,78], mean=78 units, std\u224810.4. Profit $19 >> holding $1 implies high service target; use recent demand estimates to avoid lost sales while keeping holding modest. Chosen: L inferred from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on last 5 periods to capture the sustained elevated demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all past periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 9-11 = 69,78,116) shows a sustained uplift across 3 periods (mean=87.67) vs historical sample mean (~37). To quickly respond to the elevated demand while respecting low holding cost, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime at Periods 9-11: avg=87.67 units/period (Periods 9-11 = 69,78,116), sustained 3 periods; +137% vs historical sample mean (~37).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so promised lead time appears reliable. Recent demand has shifted up: Periods 9-12 demands = 69,78,116,102 (avg\u224891.25) vs historical sample mean \u224837; regime length = 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher demand I set L=default (promised 0), use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture recent volatility. This increases the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while the low holding cost (1 vs profit 19) and high target service level (q=0.95) justify higher safety stock. No overdue shipments detected.

Use lead time=default (promised 0, historically confirmed). Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (1+L multiplier applied by backend). Set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock responsive to the regime; this balances service level versus holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs historical samples: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 12-14) = 102, 61, 74 (avg \u224879), sustained multi-period uplift vs historical mean \u224837. On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so immediate coverage is ~0.85\u20131.0 of one recent-period demand; no shipments appear delayed and all concluded lead times = 0. Choose L=default (promised lead time 0 confirmed by concluded history). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher demand regime (focus on the most recent 3-period average) and sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the target base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability to limit extra holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=38, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Demand recently elevated vs historical; to be responsive to the latest demand realizations I set L=default (promised lead time=0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 13-15 = 61,74,76) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while limiting overreaction. sigma_hat=default to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (capture recent demand uptick) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1930.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical samples and concluded history show actual lead time=0 consistently (all concluded arrivals list lead_time 0). Recent demand has been elevated vs early historical: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12-16 = 102,61,74,76,102) average ~83.0 which reflects the sustained higher regime noted earlier. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised/default lead time (0) and base the demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current elevated mean and recent volatility. Thus: L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 demands). This balances higher target base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent variance to limit over-ordering under holding cost $1/unit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded orders have arrived with lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=38, in-transit=0; to cover the current period's demand plus maintain service with high profit/low holding cost, I use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture the current elevated mean/variance while keeping L at the promised (observed) value of 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical samples (Jan 2019) mean ~37, but recent history shows higher, volatile demand with confirmed regime shifts (Periods 1-3 avg 55.3 and Periods 9-11 avg 87.7). All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To be responsive to recent higher/volatile demand while limiting noise sensitivity, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L)*mean on the last 7 demand observations (captures recent elevated demand but smooths spikes). Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability over (1+L). This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost.

Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with current variability.

Most recent demands (Periods18-20 = 66,86,69) average \u224873.7, indicating the higher-demand regime persists. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time 0 historically. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=19, holding=1) I use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime (recent_N N=3) so the backend builds a base-stock sized to cover the current elevated demand while keeping holding exposure limited given high profit margin.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (every concluded order: arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 19-21) = [86, 69, 78], recent mean \u224877.7, materially above long-run historical mean (~37) and matches earlier recorded regime shift; demand appears stable over last 3 periods. Given promised lead time=0 and confirmed arrivals=0 historically, use default lead time. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime and keep service (profit $19 vs holding $1 -> high critical fractile \u22480.95), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures most recent demand level and volatility). This raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while the high profit/holding ratio justifies more safety stock. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent demand has settled well above historical sample mean (recent weeks ~75 units/week vs historical ~37), and actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so current cover is low vs expected weekly demand ~75; prompt replenishment needed. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime (last 5 weeks mean \u224875.4) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices align the base-stock to current demand regime while keeping lead-time assumptions consistent with observed concludes.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (many concluded messages showing arrived same-period), so use default promised L=0. Recent demand (Periods 21-23 = 78,78,73; mean=76.33) is lower than the earlier peak regime (~87) and higher than the long-run historical sample mean (~37). I detect a stable short recent regime reflected in the last 3 weeks, so I set demand forecast using recent_N (N=3) to capture current pace without overreacting to earlier spikes. Volatility is best estimated from the same recent window to reflect current variance. These choices keep base_stock aligned with observed same-period replenishment (L=0) and tune mean/\u03c3 to recent realized sales, balancing service level (capture current demand) against holding cost given on-hand=16 and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Lead time historically observed = 0 consistently. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 periods (P20-24 demands = 69,78,78,73,69) average ~73.4. To align stocking with current demand regime and avoid excess holding, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)*recent mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This favors right-sized orders matching recent demand while keeping holding costs low.

All historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so no evidence to change promised lead time. To keep responsiveness to the recent downward drift while protecting service, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures latest regime of ~72 units/period). Using L=default (promised 0) keeps OR engine assumptions aligned with observed arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has cooled from the earlier spike (Periods 9-11) \u2014 last 5 realized demands (Periods 22-26) = 78,73,69,63,51 (mean=66.8). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so available supply is low vs a ~67/wk demand. All concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 consistently. To avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, I set L to default (promised 0) and use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat targets the current lower recent mean rather than older high-volatility periods; sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect recent variability. This balances service level (cover current weeks of demand) against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical baseline mean\u224837 (Jan samples) but recent weeks show higher demand; last 3 demands = 63, 51, 64 (mean\u224859.33). Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L to keep backend expectation aligned. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated regime without overreacting to older low-demand data; this keeps service high given low holding cost (H=$1) vs profit ($19). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility in the same short window. These choices prioritize meeting the recent higher demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 69,63,51,64,53; mean=60) has been sustained for 5 periods. On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue shipments observed (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Observed lead time history is stable at 0, so set L=default. To react to the recent lower-but-stable regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures Periods 24-28 mean across (1+L) review+lead), and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (matching recent demand) while avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period and profit=$19/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg=60 units/period (Periods 24-28 = 69,63,51,64,53), sustained 5 periods; -31% vs prior high regime (Periods 9-11 avg=87.67).

Recent demand regime (Periods 24-28) shows a sustained lower regime with mean \u224860 units/period over 5 periods; use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the current regime (with (1+L) multiplier applied by backend). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock sized to current demand regime and avoid overstocking given low holding cost relative to profit.

Recent demand has settled into the lower-high regime observed from Periods 24-30 (demands: 69,63,51,64,53,51,64,53,69,56 \u2014 recent 7 periods avg \u224858.6). To reflect the confirmed same-period replenishment and the sustained recent demand regime, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock targets the current regime while keeping holding costs moderate.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand (Periods 29-31 = 69,56,62) averages 62.33, consistent with the lower post-peak regime noted at Period 29 (Periods 24-28 avg ~60). On-hand=11, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; expect current-period demand after decision, so keep replenishment responsive. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically (orders placed have arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Set L=default to match promised (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime mean over the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full samples (sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding overreacting to older high-demand spikes.

Historical data shows multiple regime shifts; most recent demand (Periods 30-32 = 56,62,53) averages ~57 units/period, indicating a lower recent regime vs earlier highs. All concluded lead-times have been 0 historically, so use default promised L=0. To adapt quickly to the most recent regime and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 3 demand periods (captures current mean across review+lead) and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces excess inventory while maintaining service given current demand evidence.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Recent demand has settled lower than the earlier peak; last 5 realized demands (Periods 29-33 = 69,56,62,53,90) average \u224866 units/period. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5) so mu_hat reflects the current regime. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. I keep L as default (promised=0) since observed lead time remains 0. This provides the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean and recent volatility so base-stock targets respond to the current demand level and variability.

Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 56,62,53,90,69) shows higher mean and variability than long-run historical baseline and no new multi-period regime confirmed beyond recent window. To react quickly to recent demand while limiting exposure to stale historical averages, I use a recent_N=5 forecast (captures the last 5 weeks mean=66) and matching recent_N=5 volatility estimate. These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the recent uptick while L=default leverages observed 0 lead time, balancing service (profit per unit high) against low holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has fluctuated (last 5 period demands avg ~65) but prior carry-over insights record sustained regime shifts and there is no new 3+-period sustained change since Period 29, so I rely on full-sample defaults to avoid overfitting short noise. Using defaults lets the OR backend compute base_stock from the long-run sample mean/variance, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with holding cost conservatively given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has cooled from earlier high regime; the last 6 observed demands (Periods 31-36) = [62,53,90,69,53,52], suggesting a moderate, slightly volatile regime around ~60 units. All observed lead times = 0 (orders have consistently arrived same period). I set L=default to trust promised lead time. To capture the most recent demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock and cap on the latest regime while preserving responsiveness to the occasional spike. This balances service (avoid stockouts from mid-week spikes) vs low holding cost by focusing on recent mean/variance rather than long-ago samples.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent observed demand (Periods 33-37 = 90,69,53,52,50) averages ~62.8 units \u2014 consistent with the previously recorded moderate regime (Period 29 insight: avg~60). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0, current on-hand must cover this period's demand after decision. No evidence of new sustained changepoint (need \u22653 periods of a new level beyond existing insights). Therefore: keep L at default (promised lead time), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current recent regime (uses the last 5 demand samples to reflect the modestly elevated mean and recent volatility). This balances service (captures recent higher mean vs historic) while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (every concluded order arrived same period) so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand since Period 30 (56,62,53,90,69,53,52,50,51) shows no sustained (>3 periods) regime change vs prior history. To stay robust and leverage full history while keeping service high (profit >> holding cost), use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples and promised lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time 0). Recent demand has moderated vs prior highs; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39 = 53,52,50,51,22) average ~45.6. No evidence of lost shipments. To keep service high while limiting holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high service quantile), use lead time = default (promised 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the newest regime while smoothing the isolated low outlier (P39). These parameters steer the OR engine to a base-stock near current short-term demand (1+L)*(recent mean) and a volatility consistent with recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods, so keep L as default (promised 0). Recent demand shows some volatility with a few low weeks (Periods 39-40 = 22,23) but a broader recent window is closer to mid-range demand. To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1, I use a short recent window to capture the current regime while smoothing single-week dips: set mu_hat via recent_N on last 8 demand samples (Periods 33-40) and leave sigma_hat as default to reflect historical variability over the full sample set. This increases stock to avoid lost sales from underordering while not overstating volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep L as default (promised 0). Recent demand has dropped: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 39-41) = 22, 23, 25; I use a short recent_N forecast to avoid overstocking given the sustained low demand. Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce base-stock sizing and volatility estimates accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: recent avg Periods 39-41 = 23.3 units/period (22,23,25), sustained 3 periods; significant drop vs prior regime (e.g., Periods 24-28 avg=60).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been low: Periods 40-42 = 23,25,45; on-hand=16, in-transit=0 (no arrivals expected). No evidence of lost shipments; historical lead times observed = 0. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent short-term regime (Periods 40-42 mean=31) so the backend sets base_stock for current low-demand conditions while reacting quickly if demand rebounds. Sigma also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run variability, keeping inventory light given low holding cost relative to profit.

Recent demand shows a low regime around Periods 39-41 (22,23,25) but last three periods (41-43 = 25,45,28) show a modest uptick. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 3 periods to capture the recent increase while keeping variance estimate also recent.

Recent demand (Periods 42-44 = 45, 28, 33) reflects the current low-demand regime identified in prior carry-over insight. To keep the OR backend responsive to the latest regime while limiting holding cost, set L to default (promised lead time = 0), and use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 3 observed demands. This keeps base stock tuned to current lower demand and avoids overstock given holding cost=$1/unit/period and profit=$19/unit.

Recent three-period demand (Periods 43-45 = 28,33,81) shows a spike in Period 45 but only 3 samples; no sustained 3+ period shift beyond previously recorded carry-over insights. All historical concluded lead-times = 0. To balance service vs holding cost ahead of holiday week, I use a short recent demand window (3) to capture the uptick while keeping lead time at promised (default).

Historical concluded lead times all 0; recent demand has a volatile spike (Period 45=81) but no sustained new regime since prior carry-over insights. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility (use all-sample mean/std) so the OR engine applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std estimates, avoiding overreaction to a single holiday spike while keeping service.
