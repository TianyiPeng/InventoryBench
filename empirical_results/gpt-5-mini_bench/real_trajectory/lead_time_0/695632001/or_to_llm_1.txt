This recent mean is far below the historical sample mean (\u2248161) that OR uses, and the low-demand regime has persisted for 8 periods, so OR's recommendation (168) is too large and would raise holding cost and risk overstock.

A reasonable target pipeline (on-hand + order) is roughly one-period mean plus a normal-safety buffer (\u224868.6 + 1.645*24.7 \u2248 109). With on-hand=20 this implies order_raw \u224889, but I trim it conservatively because the low regime appears sustained and holding cost, while small, accumulates over many periods.
