No evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Given demand regime shift and low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19), prioritize service level. e) Order logic: Forecast next-period weekly demand \u224870\u201390 (use recent 90 as likely), assume some upside. To avoid stockouts while actual lead time is still uncertain, order enough for ~2\u20133 weeks of demand. I choose a conservative, service-focused order of 200 units to cover upcoming demand and protect against short lead-time variance while keeping holding cost modest.",
