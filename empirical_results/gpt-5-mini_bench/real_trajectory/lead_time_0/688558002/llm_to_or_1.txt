Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a strong upward trend across the five available samples (6,11,48,72,90). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need (1+L) coverage. Use L default (promised lead time=0) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the clear upward regime across all available weeks; this sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the observed surge while sigma captures increased uncertainty, balancing service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04: average of first 3 weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-21) = 21.67 units/week vs last 3 weeks (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = 70.00 units/week (+223%), sustained increase over 5 samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: last 3 samples (2019-01-21,01-28,02-04) average ~70/week vs earlier ~21. On-hand=40, in-transit=0; on-hand covers ~0.6 weeks at the new demand level, so we should replenish to meet higher regime. Observed lead time in Period 1 was 0 (order arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples to reflect the new higher mean and volatility; this helps the OR backend raise the base stock to maintain service while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded lead times = 0 (P1,P2). Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift upward (carry-over insight already recorded). Set L by calculating observed lead time average (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (includes the five most recent weekly samples and the two recent period demands). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility in the new regime. These choices raise base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost considered via OR backend's z* and cap.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent history shows confirmed same-period arrivals (orders in P1\u2013P3 arrived in P1\u2013P3) => actual lead time = 0. Demand samples: [6,11,48,72,90]; there is a sustained upward regime (last 3-week avg = 70 vs first 3-week avg = 21.67). Current on-hand=8, in-transit=0; recent demand surge suggests stocking to the higher regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the most recent higher-demand regime so the OR backend raises the base-stock toward the 70 units/week regime while controlling variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1338.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders in Periods 1\u20134 all arrived same period (lead_time=0) and recent demand has shifted materially higher vs older samples. No overdue shipments. Set L by "calculate" to confirm the observed zero lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the sustained demand increase), scaled by (1+L). This raises the base-stock to meet higher observed demand while keeping holding exposure controlled given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1, Period2, Period3, Period4 orders all arrived same period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1337.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime (last 3 samples avg=70/week vs earlier ~21.7). On-hand=69, in-transit=0; with lead time confirmed 0, available stock covers ~1 week of elevated demand\u2014no overdue shipments. Set L to default (promised 0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained spike while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (samples: 6,11,48,72,90) with last 3 weeks averaging much higher; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in multiple concluded periods. On-hand=55, in-transit=0, so orders arrive same period if placed. I set L to default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last three high-demand samples) to capture the new higher regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For uncertainty I use recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while holding costs are low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20137). Recent demand regime is elevated and sustained; last 5 realized weekly demands (P3\u2013P7 = 123,75,74,82,75) average ~85.8. Set L=default to rely on promised lead time (confirmed by arrivals). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend targets a base stock sized to recent demand while limiting excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u20138 arrivals same period). Demand has a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (user carry-over). I use L=default to keep promised 0 (confirmed). For demand I focus on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 realized demands = Periods 4\u20138: 75,74,82,75,92) to capture current higher mean and variation; this yields a (1+L)\xd7recent mean forecast and recent volatility for safety. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability and keep base-stock service level aligned with elevated demand while limiting holding cost given low holding $1/unit.

Period 10 (2019-04-15): on-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a sustained higher-demand regime since late Jan (carry-over insight). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time=0. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. To capture the recent higher demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses most recent 5 demand samples: Period5-9) so the base-stock reflects the current regime while keeping variability aligned to recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: last 5 samples (Periods 7-11 demand: 75,92,39,31,??) but earlier 5-sample window (Periods 1-5) averaged ~70/week; overall recent variability is lower but mean elevated vs earliest samples. On-hand=75, in-transit=0 and no overdue/lost shipments (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed 0 historically) to reflect true same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed recent regime (more weight on latest sustained higher-demand periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while keeping safety stock aligned with recent variability; with profit=$19 and holding=$1, the backend will compute the appropriate service quantile and the capped order cap will limit excessive orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and past concluded orders consistently showed lead_time=0 (Periods 1-11), so keep L as default. Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 75,92,39,31,48) shows a lower, more variable regime versus the early spike; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current mean demand (1+L)*mean over last 5 weeks. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock responsive to the recent regime while leveraging the high profit/low holding cost ratio (q\u22480.95) to maintain high service with controlled holdings.

Lead time observed consistently 0 in concluded history; use observed lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the downward regime in the last 5 samples (captures current mean/volatility); this keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

To keep service high with minimal holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time and stable recent demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory.

On-hand=88, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm 0. I set L=default to use promised 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (orders from P1\u2013P14 arrived same period). Demand has two regimes: a high spike in late Jan/early Feb then lower, steadier demand since Mar. Recent 5-week demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 48,43,28,32,26) averages ~35.4, indicating the recent lower regime and reduced volatility. To avoid excess holding while maintaining service with confirmed 0 lead time, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align base-stock to the current lower-demand regime and recent variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent weekly demand has settled much lower (~25\u201343 units) versus the early high-regime spike in Jan\u2013Feb. On-hand=37, in-transit=0 \u2014 ~1 week of current recent demand coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the new lower demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data: recent_N=5 (last five demand observations) to capture the current mean/volatility and avoid carrying excess inventory from early high-regime samples. This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost given high holding duration risk with low demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 demand samples: 28,32,26,25,30; mean=28.2) and on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (captures (1+L)*mean over last 5 weeks). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match current demand and limit holding cost while preserving serviceability given same-day arrivals.

To avoid overstock given low holding cost but preserve service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime (recent_N=6) so the OR engine sizes orders to current observed demand level and reduced volatility.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To align the OR baseline with the current low-demand regime I set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 5 weeks, reducing excess stocking vs using the earlier high-demand samples.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined from the earlier peak (Periods 1-14) to a lower regime from Period 15 onward (Period 15-20 demands: 26,25,30,24,15,12). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use L=default (promised = 0), and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the recent regime length) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 samples, which reduces target base-stock relative to the earlier high-demand period and limits overstock risk given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given high profit/low holding cost tradeoff, use L=default (promised 0). Forecast demand using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. This keeps base_stock tied to recent demand and limits orders when on-hand already covers ~1 week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 confirmed across many periods) and recent weekly demand roughly in the low-20s (recent weeks: 30,24,15,12,17,32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we expect current period demand after decision. I select default L to use promised lead time (0) because conclude messages consistently confirm L=0. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable lower-demand regime since May. Defaults avoid overfitting short recent dips and rely on established sample set; with holding cost low ($1) relative to profit ($19) the backend's q will drive a positive safety stock.

I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) covering Periods 16-23 where demands = [25,30,24,15,12,17,32,20] to capture the current low regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given ample on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent on-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=0 (orders arriving same period), and demand has settled below early 2019 spike. I choose default lead time (promised=0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided samples\u2014this balances service level and holding cost given stable recent demand and current healthy on-hand inventory, avoiding unnecessary extra purchases.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled at a lower regime vs early 2019 (last 5 demands: 17,32,20,17,11; mean=19.4). Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0; keep using promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding, set demand estimate using recent 5 samples for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show sustained same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a past demand regime shift (early 2019 spike) already recorded. No new multi-period changepoint in the recent weeks: demand has been moderate with occasional replenishments arriving same period. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, balancing service level and holding cost given low on-hand inventory and confirmed 0 LT.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; recent demand has moderated but is variable. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods, so use promised lead time (default). Demand forecast uses the most recent 5 weeks (periods 25-29: demands 11,27,56,52,32) to capture current regime; set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5). Volatility likewise from recent 5 samples to reflect current variability; set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5). This keeps replenishment aligned to recent demand while avoiding overweighting older high-season spikes; with L=0 the policy will order to the recent (1+L) mean while accounting for observed variance.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last 5 weeks: 27,56,52,32,80) shows elevated/volatile demand versus earlier low summer weeks; no evidence of lead-time changes (historical concludes confirm lead_time=0). To balance service and holding cost I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime for both demand mean and volatility, and keep L as default (promised lead time=0).

To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, set L using calculated observed lead times (0); set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new higher-volatility regime. These params raise base-stock to cover the recent higher mean and variability while holding cost ($1) remains small vs profit ($19).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted to a higher, volatile regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 28-32) = [52, 32, 80, 152, 153], mean \u2248 93.8/week and sample std \u2248 56.2. Multiple recent stockouts (Periods 30-32) indicate service risk if we understock. Lead time history is consistently 0. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping the sample size >=3 and \u226420. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so the OR engine sees the current volatility. These parameters increase the base-stock to cover the recent demand spike and account for variability, balancing high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=435, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (sustained across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has elevated and volatile values (most recent 5 concluded demands: Period30-34 = 80,152,153,522,192) indicating a shifted, higher-mean regime but with high variance and a large spike (522) that may be transient. To capture the current regime while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order cap using recent demand stats, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 samples). This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory; L=default keeps arrival assumptions aligned with observed 0-period lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=376, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-35 arrivals same period). Recent demand has jumped since Period 31 (demands: 152,153,522,192,130) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime starting ~P31. To capture the new regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high demand. L uses default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. With (1+L) scaling and recent statistics the OR backend will raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping sigma based on recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost of $1 vs profit $19.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=396, in-transit=0. Recent history shows large demand spikes in Sept/Oct (Periods 30-34) but lead time has been consistently 0. On-hand is high relative to typical weekly demand, so use conservative/default forecasting to avoid over-ordering while honoring proven lead-time=0. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised lead time (0); mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean(all samples) so baseline demand estimate incorporates full history including recent spikes; sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (captures historical spikes) against holding cost given current high on-hand stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=273, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals; actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 30-37) exhibits a sustained higher regime (large spikes in Weeks 30-34 and elevated weekly demand through 37). To capture the recent high-demand regime, set L to promised (default 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates with N=8 (covers Periods 30-37). Using recent_N for sigma captures recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while the low holding cost ($1) makes carrying extra inventory acceptable.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=259, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. Recent demand has stepped up since late Sep; last 5 weeks demands = {192,130,105,123,156} mean\u2248141.2. To avoid stockouts while containing holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast to recent regime (recent_N, N=5) so mu_hat reflects current elevated weekly demand; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover current higher demand) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=180, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained same-period arrivals). Demand surged beginning Period 31 (large weekly spikes in Periods 31-35, then elevated through Period 39), indicating a new higher-demand regime starting around Period 31. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 31-39) to capture the post-change higher mean and volatility; N=9 = regime length (Periods 31\u201339), satisfies 3<=N<=20. This increases the base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat from recent samples lets the OR backend size safety stock against observed volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=302, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) across many periods and no recent lost shipments; demand history includes a sustained higher-demand regime since late Jan 2019. Given confirmed L=0 and large sample set, use population defaults so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps base-stock sized to long-run demand while backend's z* (based on profit/holding) controls service level; with high on-hand and zero pipeline, this avoids aggressive additional ordering and limits holding cost risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=228, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 38-41) = [156,79,96,74] showing elevated peak in P38 then moderate levels; no new sustained regime shift detected. Lead time history (concluded periods) consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. To make the forecast sensitive to the recent November demand pattern, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N of the last 4 samples (N=4) so the OR backend weights the recent elevated volatility while keeping responsiveness to the current moderate demand. This balances service (given high profit $19) against holding cost $1 by using a short, recent window rather than full-history smoothing.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use promised lead time. Recent demand shows elevated activity in Oct\u2013Nov with a large one-week spike (310 on 2019-11-25) likely seasonal (holiday). To bias ordering toward recent regime while limiting overreaction to a single extreme week, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (captures ~Oct\u2013Nov behavior). This raises the base-stock to protect service during the holiday window while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime change confirmed (spike is single-week), so no carry-over insight added.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=257, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (no delays). Recent demand shows volatility including a large one-week spike (Period 42=310) but subsequent weeks moderate (Periods 39-43 = 79,96,74,310,49). To capture current regime while downweighting distant history, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures the recent spike and surrounding weeks). Keep L=default since lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. These choices give the OR engine a (1+L)-adjusted recent mean and recent std to balance service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=240, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (no overdue or missing shipments). Recent demand history includes large spikes (Sep\u2013Dec) but the previously recorded regime shift remains the best persistent signal; no new 3+ period sustained change detected. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and the full-sample demand prior, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.95) while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes given ample historical variability. No incoming arrivals expected this period (in-transit=0), so orders will top up per base-stock computed by backend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift earlier in year; latest weeks (Nov-Dec) included large spikes (Period 42 demand=310, Period 43-44 orders large) suggesting holiday variability. On-hand=185, in-transit=0; with lead time 0 we can rely on same-period replenishment. I select L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed as 0), mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples capturing long-run and holiday effects, and sigma_hat=default so backend uses overall std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults balance service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding explicit aggressive overforecasting given already-high on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=184, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand shows a holiday spike (Period 42 demand=310) but the last 5 concluded weeks (P42\u2013P46 = 310,49,58,55,35) imply an elevated short-run mean with one large outlier; to keep service during potential post-holiday variability while avoiding excessive long-term holding, I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility (captures latest regime including spike). L set to promised (default = 0) consistent with confirmed zero lead time. These parameters bias orders toward meeting (L+1)-period demand under current high short-term variability while the OR backend caps order size to limit excess inventory and holding cost.
