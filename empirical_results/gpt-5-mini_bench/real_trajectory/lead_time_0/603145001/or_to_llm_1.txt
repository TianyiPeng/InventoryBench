Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history through Period 46 shows all orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time = 0 (consistent with prior carry-over). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current-period demand. Demand analysis: historical samples show a sustained lower-regime from mid-July to early Sep, but recent weeks (Periods 45\u201346) exhibit a sharp rebound (d=76,97) and several prior weeks in Nov\u2013Dec were low-to-moderate; regime change is not yet a 3+ period sustained new pattern. OR recommendation: 143 units (base-stock cap applied) already accounts for promised L=0 and uses full history; given lead time=0 orders arrive same period and profit >> holding cost (q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645), the cost of under-ordering (lost profit) is much larger than holding cost. With no pipeline and recent high demand spikes, I accept the OR quantity to avoid stockouts this period. Final strategy: place order equal to OR recommendation (143 units) so arrival occurs this period to meet possible high demand while holding cost impact is small relative to foregone profit if stocked out.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's 143 units \u2014 lead time confirmed 0, no inventory/pipeline, recent high demand spike (Periods 45\u201346) risks stockouts and profit >> holding cost, so accept OR's suggested order to cover current-period demand.",
