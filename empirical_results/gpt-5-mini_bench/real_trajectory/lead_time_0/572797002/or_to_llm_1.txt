Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history (Periods 1\u201346) confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand = 201, in-transit = 0, so available units for this period = 201. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 42\u201346) averaged ~55 units/week (125,31,38,42,38) but only the 125 is an isolated spike; the last four weeks average ~37. OR recommended 50 units based on historical demand and promised lead time, but with lead time = 0 we do not need to pre-build pipeline. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $19 \u2192 avoid tying up capital in excess inventory. Given on-hand 201 >> expected single-period demand (~40\u201355) and no incoming pipeline, ordering would create extra holding cost with little benefit (no multi-period lead time). Therefore order 0 units for 572797002 to minimize holding cost while meeting expected demand this period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order 0 (vs OR's 50): actual lead time = 0 and on-hand 201 comfortably covers expected weekly demand (~40\u201355), so avoid additional holding cost.",
