Demand outlook: recent concluded demands (P43\u2013P46 = 26, 17, 66, 53) average \u224840.5 with volatility; overall recent months show intermittent spikes but no sustained new regime since Period16 insight. OR recommended 52 (uses historical mean and safety stock). Adjustment decision: order smaller than OR because (a) lead time = 0 so any order immediately protects this period but we already have substantial on-hand inventory, (b) holding cost is relatively high ($1 vs $4 profit \u2192 q=0.8) so excess inventory reduces objective, and (c) recent demand average (~41) is below on-hand+OR, so full OR order risks overstock. I choose a conservative top-up of 20 units: with arrival this period total available becomes 68, enough to cover a demand spike while limiting end-of-period holding cost. Follow-up: monitor next concluded demands; if several high-demand periods persist, increase orders toward OR level or higher.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order reduced from OR's 52 to 20 because on-hand=48 already covers expected ~41 demand and lead time=0; smaller top-up limits holding cost while protecting against moderate spikes.",
