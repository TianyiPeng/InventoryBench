Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~53 units/week with moderate variability (std ~12.4). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer longer lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time is used (default). Using default demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) is appropriate given no evidence of a regime shift or delayed shipments; this balances service vs. holding cost conservatively.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand spike in Period 1 (demand=135) well above prior weekly samples (46,56,43,44,76). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus uncertainty. Promised lead time was observed as 0 in Period 1 conclude, so use default lead time. To respond to the recent upward demand while avoiding overreacting to a single high week, I use a short recent window (N=3) for demand mean/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest regime (samples: 44,76,135 average ~85). This raises the order target versus the all-sample mean and increases safety stock to improve service while recognizing holding cost equals profit (q=0.5) and backend will cap orders. No strong evidence of sustained regime change or lead-time drift yet, so no explicit adjustments to L.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived with lead_time=0 (two observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples mean=53 units (samples: 46,56,43,44,76). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (backend will average observed lead times, currently 0). I set mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 53, reflecting the recent average weekly demand covering the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples to capture historical variability. These choices prioritize meeting typical weekly demand given confirmed same-period arrivals while avoiding extra holding cost from overstating demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived in the same period (lead_time=0) and all ending on-hand were 0 after strong sales \u2014 consistent with mean demand \u224853/week from provided samples. I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time is consistently 0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which matches the available data and balances service vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to short-term variability while leveraging confirmed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period1; Period2\u2192Period2; Period3\u2192Period3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period1-4 arrivals same-period). Use default lead time and demand estimates based on full sample history (mean=53) so backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run samples while avoiding overreacting to recent high sales spikes.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has declined across the last 5 periods (135,149,108,91,72); on-hand=12, in-transit=0, so coverage is low for upcoming demand if spikes occur. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. I therefore use promised lead time (default=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the recent downward demand regime while preserving some safety stock. This lets the OR backend size base_stock to reflect lower recent mean demand but still account for variability via recent sigma, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and elevated weekly demand over the last 6 periods (demands: 135,149,108,91,72,124). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the last 6 observed weekly demands, capturing the current higher-demand regime and recent variability so the OR backend can compute an appropriate base-stock while avoiding over-reliance on older low-volume samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand is high and volatile (period demands: P1=135, P2=149, P3=108, P4=91, P5=72, P6=124, P7=169). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period plus lead. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; use observed-average for L. Demand appears to have shifted upward and is variable in the most recent 5 weeks (P3\u2013P7 show higher variance and recent spike at P7), so use a recent_N=5 estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and avoid stale early-Jan samples. These choices give the OR backend a short lead (L\u22480) and demand estimates focused on the latest regime, balancing service (cover recent high demand) vs holding cost by not inflating estimates with older low-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20138 arrivals same period). Recent demand shows rising volatility with large spikes (e.g. Periods 7\u20138: 169, 227). I therefore use the default lead time (trust confirmed 0) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this leverages the full sample set while the backend's base-stock formula balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Lead time confirmed as 0 in concluded history (all observed arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand shows a sustained upward regime starting Period 6: recent demands P6-P9 = [124,169,227,163], avg_recent=170.75 vs prior P1-P5 avg=111 (+54%). No overdue or in-transit stock. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent mean over the review+lead window. Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect elevated recent variability. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has risen and stabilized above earlier winter levels: last 5 periods' demand = [124,169,227,163,136], mean=163.8. On-hand=35, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time and concluded evidence show lead time = 0. I set L to default (use promised 0). To capture the recent, sustained demand regime shift I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend targets a base-stock around the higher recent mean ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase service level to avoid stockouts under the new regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's q calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg demand increased from 53.0 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04 samples) to 163.8 (Periods 6\u201310), +209% sustained for 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201311 elevated demand). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs. elevated demand; no overdue shipments observed and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the post-changepoint elevated regime (Periods 6\u201311) so the backend bases the base-stock on the higher recent mean and variance, improving service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the capped order cap limit extreme replenishment and control holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Confirmed lead time = 0 periods from concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201312 all showed 0). Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (sustained higher demand through Periods 6\u201312). To capture the new regime, set lead time by calculation (uses observed LT=0) and set demand forecast using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201312, regime length 7). Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures higher mean) while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201314) = [136,136,131,97,113], mean ~122.6. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change regime and reduce influence of older low-demand samples. Keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since multiple conclude messages confirm 0 lead time. This balances service (capture elevated recent mean) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to the new regime rather than the full-history mean.

I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent regime (capture reduced mean and current volatility) so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods. A sustained demand regime shift occurred starting Period 6 (higher mean sustained through recent periods). To capture the new regime I use recent_N over the post-shift samples (Periods 6\u201316) so the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and std reflect elevated demand and avoid systematic understock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 6 (higher weekly demand through Period 17). On-hand=36, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0. I choose L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201317) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the higher demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (recorded previously). On-hand=59, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods; use promised/default to let backend treat arrivals same-period. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N (last 10 samples) for both demand mean and volatility so forecasts reflect recent elevated volumes while avoiding overreacting to single-week noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the full older low-demand history.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple period confirmations). Recent demand has moderated versus the earlier +209% spike (Periods 6\u201310); last 5 observed demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [137,157,109,83,74] \u2192 current demand regime appears lower and more variable. To align orders with the most recent demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current mean and volatility over the last 5 periods so the OR backend will compute base_stock reflecting current demand and 0 lead time. This balances service (following recent demand) against holding cost given on-hand cover of roughly half a week.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (Period1\u21921 through Period20\u219220), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has trended down over the last 5 concluded periods (Demands P16\u2013P20 = 157,109,83,74,59), indicating a lower short-term mean and lower volatility than the earlier elevated regime. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (captures the downward shift); use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201321) confirm actual lead time = 0 and no missing shipments. Recent demand has moderated from the high regime seen in Periods 6\u201310; last 5 observed demands (Periods 17\u201321 = 109,83,74,59,54) average ~75.8. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by history), and base demand estimates on the most recent 5-week regime to capture the recent downward drift while keeping responsiveness high. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) instructs the OR engine to set a base-stock tuned to current lower demand and lower variability, which reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Recent demand has declined vs. the earlier high regime; last 7 concluded demand samples (Periods 17\u201323) average ~64 units/week, lower than the prior elevated regime. I set L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the more recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility; this keeps orders aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has declined from spring peaks to a lower summer regime: last 5 demands (Periods 20\u201324) = [59,54,29,34,24], mean \u224840. On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically (carry-over). I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean \u224840) and volatility of the last 5 observations so the OR backend targets service for the current summer demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical series shows a sustained higher-demand regime earlier (Periods 6\u201310) but demand has steadily declined in recent weeks (Periods 21\u201325 demand = 54,29,34,24,15). With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 (z\u22480), so policy centers on (1+L)\xd7mean demand; to avoid overstocking given the clear recent downward shift I use recent demand (last 5 weeks) to set mean and volatility. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in history, so keep L as default. These parameters reduce over-ordering vs. using full-history averages and balance service vs. holding cost given current low demand and zero in-transit stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has declined in summer: last 5 demands = [29,34,24,15,13], mean=23. On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed historically). To match recent lower regime and avoid excess holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and reduces overstock risk while preserving service against near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demand has been low and stable in July\u2013Aug (Periods 23\u201327: demands 34,24,15,13,20), indicating a downshift from earlier spring spike. No overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (most recent 5 weeks) so the OR backend sizes base stock to current demand and limits holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent weekly demand has declined into a low-summer regime (last 5 demands: 24,15,13,20,25; mean\u224819.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and reduced variability; this keeps orders small to limit holding cost while meeting immediate demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (higher mean since Period 6). No recent lost shipments. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand samples, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history. To align the backend base-stock with the current low-demand regime while using recent evidence, I use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on the most recent 5 samples to capture the new lower mean, and sigma_hat based on the same 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target inventory tight (reducing holding cost) while maintaining service for the current demand pattern.

To avoid excess holding cost with low recent demand, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period recent low-demand regime) so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent demand and reduce overstock risk.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default (promised=0). To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost and the clear recent downward demand regime, set demand forecast based on the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 28\u201332) to capture the current low-demand regime (mean \u224818 units/week). Use recent_N for sigma over the same 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock tight to current demand while the backend's cap prevents extreme orders.

On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 historically. To avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding ($1/$1) and the clear recent drop, I use the short recent window (N=4) to set demand parameters while keeping promised lead time (0). This keeps target inventory small and responsive to current low demand.

Recent demand has been low since Period 25 with no evidence of a new spike; therefore use short-run recent demand to set forecast so we don't overstock. Choose L=default (promised 0). For demand use recent_N (N=10) to capture the latest low-demand regime (Periods 25\u201334). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility and avoid understating variability. This keeps base-stock conservative given holding cost equals profit.

Recent demand (Periods 30\u201335) is substantially lower than earlier high-demand regime; to avoid excess holding cost I use a short-window recent estimate. Set L to default (promised = 0). Set mu_hat via recent_N to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples (Periods 30\u201335) so ordering reflects the recent low-demand regime. Set sigma_hat via recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility and avoid overstating uncertainty given the quiet recent weeks.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0. Demand has fallen since early Sept (Periods ~30\u201336) to a low recent regime (weekly demand mostly 7\u201324). To avoid excess holding cost, set lead time to promised (0) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 7 concluded demand observations and reduce forecast bias from the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201337 = 19,24,7,18,8,15,14,22) shows a sustained lower-demand regime (~mean ~15) vs earlier high periods. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting current demand, I use a recent-window forecast. Set L to promised/default (0) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand mean and volatility and keep orders aligned to recent sales patterns.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 30\u201338 demands: 19,24,7,18,8,15,14,22,15). Lead time previously confirmed as 0; keep promised lead time. To capture the recent low regime I use recent_N over the most recent 9 demand samples (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand regime. This keeps orders small to limit holding cost while preserving service.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (carry-over). Recent history shows modest, variable weekly demand and no new sustained regime change since Period 11. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand statistics, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overfitting to short recent dips and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I keep L=default (promised=0). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent stable low-demand window (N=11 weeks) so the OR engine targets lower replenishment and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent observed demand has been low (Periods 30\u201341 many weeks with single-digit to low-double-digit sales) and on-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical data includes an earlier sustained high-demand regime (recorded in carry-over) but lead time has been consistently 0. I choose L=default to trust the confirmed 0-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), balancing service level (profit and stockouts) with holding cost given profit=holding. Keeping defaults avoids overreacting to recent low noise while respecting the confirmed lead-time=0 and existing documented regime shifts.

Recent demand has fallen from the mid-year peak; last 5 period demands = [15,9,13,6,9], signaling a low recent regime. Use promised lead time (default) given confirmed 0-period LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given equal profit and holding costs.

On-hand=49, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To reflect the current low-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 observed demands and (1+L) factor with L default=0.
