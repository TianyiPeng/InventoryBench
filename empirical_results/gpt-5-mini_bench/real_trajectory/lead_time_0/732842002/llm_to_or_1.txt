Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 14, 52, 121), indicating demand surge. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet rising demand. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean (mean of last 3 samples \u2248 62.33 weekly). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility in the new regime. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed upward shift while keeping holding cost consideration tied to short promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 weekly demands = [14, 52, 121], recent mean \u2248 62.3 (sustained 3 periods)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demands show a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 weeks = [14,52,121] with recent mean \u224862.3. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=63, lead_time=0), confirming observed lead time 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = 3 = regime length). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity (profit=holding, so service quantile moderate).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands show a sustained upward regime: last 5 weekly demands = [14,52,121,131,157] (mean=95). Two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) arrived same period, so actual lead time appears 0. To capture the recent higher demand regime and the confirmed 0 lead time, set L via observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock is driven by the most recent 5-week regime (captures increased mean and volatility), balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period1; Period2 order arrived in Period2). Demand regime extended: last 5 weeks avg=95 (periods 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-18), up from prior 3-week avg\u224862.3 (+52%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 for all observed orders (Period1\u20133), so use observed-average lead time. Demand has stepped up starting 2019-01-21; recent regime length \u22485 weeks (sustained higher demand). To capture the elevated recent mean and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (recent_N N=5). These parameters bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while the OR backend caps ordering to control inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has shifted up since 2019-01-21; recent 5-week average \u224895 units/week (periods 2019-01-21 through 2019-02-25 and recent weeks). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping safety for variability, set L to promised (0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service (avoiding stockouts given recent higher demand) against holding cost given current positive on-hand (41) and no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-18: recent demand has risen and then stabilized above historical pre-2019 levels. Last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 1-5) = [131,157,108,73,72], mean \u2248108.2. On-hand=46, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0; recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. To capture the elevated recent regime while keeping responsiveness, set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the last 5 weeks. This increases target base-stock to meet current demand without overreacting to older low-demand weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (observed arrivals each period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand showed a sustained upshift from Jan (carry-over) but the last 5 weeks (Periods 2\u20136: 157,108,73,72,93) better reflect the recent moderation; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime while smoothing week-to-week noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts given modest on-hand) against $1/unit holding cost by basing orders on recent mean/volatility rather than the older low or peak extremes.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand shows a higher recent mean with one large spike (Period7 demand=317) \u2014 spike appears single-period. To be responsive to elevated recent demand while smoothing one-off volatility, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent weeks more but dampen the single large spike. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for the backend cap calculation. These choices raise the base_stock to improve service under higher recent demand while using EWMA to avoid overreacting to a single extreme week, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has stepped up from earlier baseline: last 5 weekly demands = [73,72,93,317,199], mean \u2248150.8, showing higher and more volatile demand than the long-run sample. On-hand=4, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0. I set L via observed history to confirm the fast replenishment (method=calculate). To capture the recent elevated regime while limiting influence of older low weeks, I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current higher mean and observed volatility, balancing service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost (sigma_hat informs safety stock).

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility from the last 5 weeks; (1+L) factor is handled by backend.

Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (orders arrived same period). I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the recent higher demand regime while limiting holding cost, I base forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the large spike at P7 and subsequent weeks). These parameters steer the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts but keep sigma based on recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = [317,199,118,82,117]) is higher and more volatile than earlier weeks; to adapt quickly I use a short recent window. L set via calculate to reflect observed lead times=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 weeks) so the base-stock accounts for the recent elevated mean and volatility and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=60, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concludes show lead time consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher recent mean while limiting lookback to recent regime. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover recent higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand weeks; with profit=holding, service-level target q=0.5 (z=0) so mu_hat effectively sets the base stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has been elevated vs early samples; last 5-week average demand \u224899/week (periods 9\u201313: 118,82,117,107,71). On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has consistently observed 0 periods in concluded history. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the 0-period reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the sustained higher recent demand while limiting exposure to older, lower-demand weeks. This balances service (captures recent ~99/week) against holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile is conservative.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has stabilized near ~100 units/week (last 8 periods mean used to capture current regime while smoothing noise). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirms 0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L) demand and volatility based on the most recent 8 weeks, which balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given profit=holding. This protects against understocking after the earlier regime shift while limiting excessive inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime since 2019-01-21; last 5 weekly demands = [117,107,71,96,92], mean \u2248 96.6. On-hand=47, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L to 'calculate' because all observed concluded lead times are 0 so the average confirms promised same-period lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks \u2248 96.6). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P16 all arrived same period). Demand has been elevated vs. the very early history and shows variability; to keep service while limiting holdings I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current mean/volatility (last 8 weeks) and default promised lead time. This gives the OR engine a demand estimate responsive to the recent regime while relying on its service-level calculus to trade off profit vs. holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). History of concluded arrivals confirms actual lead time = 0 (all prior orders arrived same period). Recent demand shows a higher sustained regime; last 5 realized weekly demands = [71, 96, 92, 117, 75], mean \u2248 90.2. On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0, so inventory is well below one-week expected demand. Profit = holding cost, implying q=0.5 (OR backend will target mean demand). To react to the confirmed 0 lead time and recent elevated demand while limiting noise from older data, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the most relevant regime.

Recent demand has moderated from spring peaks; last 5 weeks demand = [117,75,63,56,24], recent mean \u224867. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use a short recent-window forecast (N=5). Set L to default (promised 0).

Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks; last 5 weekly demands (Periods 17-21) = [75,63,56,24,41], recent mean \u2248 51.8. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time (L=0) and forecast using the recent 5-week regime for demand and volatility. This yields a (1+L)-period forecast based on recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat, providing responsive ordering to lower recent demand while relying on confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: last 3 demands = [24,41,45], recent mean \u224836.7/wk. On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so limited cover vs ~37 expected weekly demand. Historical lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in prior periods). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time). For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower regime (use last 3 weeks to set (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed reduced variability. These settings reduce overstock risk versus using the older high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to compute a base-stock appropriate for the current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 (2019-06-24): prior avg (Periods13-19)=~81.4/wk vs recent avg (Periods20-22)=36.7/wk (\u221255%), sustained 3 periods.

Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 20 (2019-06-24): recent weekly demand samples (Periods 21-23) = [41,45,40] with evidence of lower mean vs earlier periods. All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 (observed repeatedly), and current on-hand + in-transit = 0, so any order must cover current period demand that occurs after the decision. I therefore set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time = 0 from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 21-23) to capture the new, lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward lower base stock and lower cap consistent with the confirmed demand drop, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 20: recent 5 weekly demands = [24,41,45,40,17], recent mean \u2248 33.4/week. On-hand=25, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Actual lead time has repeatedly been 0 in concluded history. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower-demand regime (avoid inflating forecasts with older high-demand weeks). These parameters reduce ordering to match current lower demand and limit holding cost while preserving service given current on-hand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand has a sustained lower regime starting Period 20 (2019-06-24) but last 6 weeks (Periods 20\u201325 demands = [24,41,45,40,17,65]) capture recent behavior including a late spike; choose recent_N with N=6 to reflect current regime while smoothing the spike. Using recent demand avoids overweighting earlier high-demand weeks and keeps safety modest given profit=holding (service quantile=0.5). Sigma set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in the lower post-June regime (regime shift at Period 20). Last 7 concluded weekly demands (Periods 20-26) show the new lower regime and capture recent variability. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps base_stock aligned with current demand and avoids excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1 => target service ~50%). No missing shipments to address.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P27 arrived same period) so use promised/observed lead time. Recent demand has risen in the last 3 weeks (Periods 25\u201327 demands = [65,72,101], mean\u224879.3) versus the lower mid-year regime (Periods 20\u201322 avg\u224836.7). To react quickly to this uptick while avoiding excess holding cost, I use a short recent window (N=3) for forecast mean and volatility so the OR backend will raise the base stock to meet the latest demand pattern but keep cap constraints in place.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; recent demand shows a pickup since Period 24 with volatile weekly sales. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so we should target a replenishment covering the short recent regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times (all 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 weeks: P24-P28 = [17,65,72,101,77]) to capture the most recent regime while smoothing older lows. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These choices make the OR engine base_stock responsive to the recent higher mean while keeping variability estimate aligned with recent swings, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders arrived same period across history), so keep L=default (promised 0). Recent demand shows no new sustained regime change; last 5 weekly demands = [65,72,101,77,66], recent mean \u224876.2. To keep responsiveness to recent volatility while avoiding overweighting older high-season weeks, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets service for current demand levels and measured variability. This balances service (capture recent demand ~76/wk) against holding cost given minimal on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been moderate after the summer dip; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 26-30) = [72,101,77,66,88] indicating a recent mean ~80/wk. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current+lead coverage. Actual observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend confirm lead time=0 from history. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures late-summer demand ~80/wk) so the OR engine builds a base-stock tuned to current volatility and avoids overstock from older high-demand weeks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (many periods with arrived units same period ordered). Demand has had regime shifts earlier (spring spike, summer drop) but recent weeks show moderate demand. I use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (periods 27-31) where weekly demand averaged ~79.4, so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean will reflect current run-rate. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability and keep safety stock aligned to current demand fluctuations. These choices keep service high given low lead time while limiting holding cost by using recent data rather than long-term higher averages.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in P1..P32 all arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 30-32 = 88, 65, 47) suggests the most recent regime is captured by the last 3 weeks (mean\u224866.7). No new sustained seasonal spike detected. To keep pipeline tight (profit=holding), set L by observed average lead time and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend targets service for the current lower-volatility, recent-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 across many periods \u2014 no evidence of delay or lost shipments. Demand exhibits prior regime shifts (higher in Feb\u2013Apr, drop around late June), and recent weeks (Periods 27\u201333) are variable without a sustained new regime. To be conservative and leverage full sample information, set L to the calculated average observed lead time (will be 0), and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (uses full-sample mean) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Demand experienced a prior regime shift around Period 20 (noted in carry-over) but no new sustained change in the last several weeks. To be responsive to very recent demand patterns I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures weeks ~P31-P34 demand) while using calculated lead time from observations (observed lead times all 0). These settings keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand while recognizing zero lead time so orders replenish same period and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 keep default promised L. Recent demand has softened vs earlier peaks; to capture the current regime I use recent_N with N=5 for demand mean and volatility (focus on last 5 weeks to reflect downward drift). This keeps base_stock responsive to recent lower demand while the OR backend will cap orders; profit and holding costs are equal so target service quantile is 0.5, and using recent data reduces overstock risk given zero in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has settled below earlier peaks; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 34-36) = [62, 40, 49], recent mean \u2248 50.3. Promised lead time was 0 and recent history consistently shows 0, so use default lead time. To keep service while limiting holding cost given low recent demand, forecast using the most recent 3 weeks (captures current regime). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the OR backend targets base stock for the current lower-demand regime and computes variability from the same window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (no evidence of delays), so use default promised L. Recent weekly demand shows no new sustained regime shift since prior insights (Oct weekly demands variable but roughly ~60/wk). To keep responsiveness to recent demand while avoiding overfit to older low/high spikes, I use a recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures last 5 weeks' mean \u224862). This supplies the OR engine with (1+L)\xd7recent mean and matching recent std to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0 (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last ~5 weeks: Periods 34-38) shows moderate weekly demand ~52\u201362; no new sustained regime shift. To keep orders responsive to latest pattern, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current mean/volatility and avoid overweighting older summer dip. This balances service (capture recent demand) vs holding cost by using short recent window rather than full-history average.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent weekly demand has been moderate-to-low compared with earlier 2019 peaks; on-hand=35, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed and actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to trust promised 0 lead time (confirmed historically). Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower-demand regime (recent weeks Periods 34-39 show variability and a recent downtick) so mu_hat reflects the most recent pattern rather than the long-run mean. Volatility similarly uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect current demand variability for the (1+L) review+lead period. These settings keep orders responsive to the recent downshift, limiting holding cost while maintaining service given on-hand stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0. Recent demand has softened versus mid-year but shows volatility; last 5-week demand (Periods 36-40) \u2248 [49,64,48,18,27], recent mean \u224841.2. I keep L estimated from observed history (calculate) since lead time repeatedly confirmed 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to adapt to the recent lower regime while retaining some smoothing. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices supply the OR engine a short lead-time and a recent-demand-based forecast so base stock and cap moderate ordering, protecting against excess holding given holding cost = profit.

To be responsive to recent demand while retaining stability, use promised lead time (default L=0), a short recent-window demand estimate (mu_hat recent_N N=5) to capture the latest mean across ~Nov spikes, and default sigma (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (critical fractile 0.5 => z*=0). No evidence of lost shipments.

Recent weekly demand has been subdued (last 5 demands: Periods 40-44 = [27,33,62,23,31], recent mean \u224835.2). No new sustained changepoint detected. I keep L at the promised/default (0) and use recent demand (N=5) to capture the latest lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand and avoids excess holding given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Recent weekly demand (Periods 41-45) shows moderate levels with last 5 demands = [33,62,23,31,36] and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments (all historical arrivals show lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus safety. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (captures recent post-season variability and recent holiday effects) so the backend's base-stock will target service with conservative safety stock while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent weekly demand has been low-moderate (last weeks ~23,31,36,36,38) after the mid-year regime drop. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Set L to promised (default). Use recent demand (most recent 5 weeks) to reflect current low-winter demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets procurement to recent demand levels and avoids excess holding cost.
