Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals so actual lead time unknown. Historical weekly samples (5): 119,73,98,97,113. Use promised lead time (default) since no observed lead-time data. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap from full-sample stats, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=100 (5 samples); recent observed demand in Period 1 was 147 but is a single high week\u2014no sustained regime change. Period 1 conclude shows orders placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). No overdue shipments. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample mean/std ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of demand shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in same period (arrived info: lead_time=0 for both), so actual lead time evidence supports L=0. Demand in P1=147 and P2=214 exceed the older Jan samples but only 2 periods of high demand \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. To remain conservative and let the OR engine combine historical stats with the confirmed lead time, I set L via calculation of observed lead times and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at their defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend can compute base stock and the capped order respecting its cap.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows arrivals for Periods 1-3 all with lead_time=0 and demand sold out until Period 3 left 18 on-hand. On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Set L by observed lead times (stable zero). Use default demand estimates (1+L)*mean of all historical samples to capture baseline weekly demand (mean=100) and default sigma to reflect historical variability. These settings instruct the OR engine to target the historical mean demand with variability-driven safety stock while accounting for zero lead time and current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->P1, P2->P2, P3->P3 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1991.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) shows same-period arrivals and stable weekly demand samples (historical weekly samples mean=100). On-hand=99, in-transit=0 \u2014 roughly equals one-week expected demand, so no urgent replenishment needed. Lead time confirmed at 0 in recent periods, so use default lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base stock balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and ending on-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (119,73,98,97,113) have mean ~100. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. I choose mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples)=~100, reflecting typical weekly demand. I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (maintain cover for ~1 period) vs holding cost given current on-hand=60 and modest holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows a sustained upward shift versus the older sample set: recent mean \u2248159 vs historical mean 100. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new regime (6-period sustained increase). For volatility I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent periods (P1\u2013P6) avg demand \u2248159 vs historical avg 100 (+59%), sustained over 6 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime increase (recent 6 periods avg \u2248159 vs historical \u2248100). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet elevated demand. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed=0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the new regime (N=6 matches 6-period sustained shift). This will raise the target base-stock to reflect higher demand while keeping lead-time assumptions accurate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over: avg \u2248159 over recent periods vs historical \u2248100). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To capture the confirmed higher recent demand while keeping variability responsive, I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)-period demand and std on the most recent 6 weeks, which reflects the sustained uplift and keeps safety stock aligned with current demand rather than long-run history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift (higher demand since Period 4, confirmed Period 7: recent ~159 vs historical ~100). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so current cover is low versus elevated demand. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (all observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (6-period sustained signal) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a higher base-stock and accounts for recent volatility. This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) against holding cost while addressing the confirmed demand increase and no outstanding in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1->P10 arrivals). Demand has a confirmed higher regime since Period 7 (sustained). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 7\u201310) to capture the higher-demand regime without diluting with older lower-demand weeks. Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward higher coverage of the new demand regime while keeping holding costs controlled by using only the recent regime samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 7; last 5 demands (P7\u2013P11) = {260,311,283,318,396}, avg\u2248313.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). To match the new high-demand regime while keeping holding cost low, set L=default to use promised 0; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to pivot the forecast and variability to the most recent sustained demand pattern. This increases target base-stock to cover the higher demand while sigma from recent data captures current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update: Periods 7\u201311 avg demand \u2248313.6 vs prior recent avg \u2248159 (Periods 1\u20136), increase \u2248+97% (sustained over 5 periods).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows sustained high-demand regime since Period 7, with Periods 7\u201312 average \u2248313.6 and latest demand 340; on-hand=59, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. To capture the elevated, persistent demand I use recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility (Periods 7\u201312) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded messages consistently show 0. This ensures base_stock targets the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind given current on-hand stock of 59.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=203, in-transit=0. Historical data and carry-over confirm lead time = 0 and a recent high-demand regime; recent 5-week demand (Periods 9\u201313 = 283,318,396,340,193) average \u2248306. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=19 and low holding cost, I target the recent regime: set L via calculate (uses observed lead times=0). Set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean (~306 units per week). Set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run low-variance history. This keeps orders responsive to the high-demand regime while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=200, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (Periods 1\u201314 confirms same-period arrivals). Demand recently rotated through higher regimes; most recent 3 periods (P12\u2013P14) show demands [340,193,230] -> recent avg \u2248254, which is substantially above long-run historical mean (~100). To reflect the latest realized demand level while keeping responsiveness (lead time=0) I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the latest regime (short recent regime length=3). For sigma I also use recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward current realized demand, limiting stockouts given zero lead time while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical concluded data show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P15 arrivals). Demand has exhibited regime shifts earlier (up through Period 12) but recent realized demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 396,340,193,230,259) is volatile and lower than the peak regime. On-hand=122, in-transit=0. I set L to default (promised 0) since arrivals have been consistently same-period. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to make the forecast responsive to the latest demand regime (captures recent drop from peak while smoothing volatility). This reduces overstock risk while keeping service for current demand spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=202, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable same-period arrivals (lead time=0) across many periods. Recent demand has moderated from the peak (Periods 7\u201311 avg \u2248313.6) to a lower but still-elevated level in Periods 12\u201316 (demands: 340,193,230,259,218; recent avg=248). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 0). For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (Periods 12\u201316) to capture the current post-peak regime; sigma also uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock linked to the current realized demand regime and the confirmed zero lead time, balancing service and holding costs given profit=19 and holding=1.

Demand has recently moderated from earlier peaks: last 5 demands (P13\u2013P17) = [193,230,259,218,160], recent avg \u2248212.

Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current lower regime and reduce excess holding; use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Recent demand has declined from the high regime (Periods 7\u201312) and the most relevant recent window is the last 6 periods (P14\u2013P19) showing a lower mean; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent regime and reduce overstocking while maintaining service.

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201322 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has declined in recent weeks: Periods 17\u201322 demands = [160,124,135,109,81,54], recent mean \u2248110. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded evidence confirms 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the recent lower-demand regime (6 most recent concluded demands), so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Historical data shows confirmed lead time = 0 (repeated arrivals P1->P1 .. P23->P23). Recent demand (Periods 13\u201323) average \u2248147 units/week (11 samples) \u2014 lower than the earlier peak but sustained for 11 periods. Given high service-level target from profit/holding (q\u22480.95) we use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current regime while keeping lead time set from observed history. Methods: L set via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 to base base-stock and variability on the most recent stable regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=226, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (multiple P1\u2192P1...P24\u2192P24), so set L to calculated average (0). Recent demand has fallen sharply since the high mid-year peaks; the last 6 concluded demands (P19\u2013P24: 135,109,81,54,56,38) show a low recent regime. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*mean and volatility based on the most recent low-demand regime. This keeps base stock aligned to current weak demand while L=calculate preserves confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows demand has returned to moderate levels after earlier spikes; on-hand=183, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ~4+ weeks at current demand rates. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods (multiple confirms). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples; this leverages the full sample set given the absence of a new sustained regime change and avoids overfitting short recent dips. This balances service level (using confirmed LT=0) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

On-hand=301, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in prior concludes). Recent demand has fallen sharply versus spring peaks: last 5 concluded demands (P23\u2013P27) = [56,38,43,25,38], avg \u224840. On-hand=263, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage for current low-demand regime. I set L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (historically confirmed). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given high holding cost sensitivity; this gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility based on the most recent 5 samples, improving responsiveness to the downward demand shift while the high profit/(profit+holding) ratio keeps service-level aggressive.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks and current on-hand 243, in-transit 0 \u2014 ample buffer vs recent weekly demand (~20\u201356 last 8 weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; demand shows past regime shifts but recent 8\u201312 weeks are lower and stable. I select L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0 so the OR backend treats review+lead correctly. I choose default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend uses full-sample estimates while respecting L=0; this balances service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) with low holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the z* service level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (the 9-period low-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent low volatility. This reduces future ordering compared with historical higher means and prevents excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed 0 lead time.

On-hand=284, in-transit=0 \u2192 ample cover for near-term demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep L=default (use promised/confirmed 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the new low-demand regime; choose N=10 (Periods 22\u201331) to capture the most recent sustained lower-demand pattern. Apply same recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility drop.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods; no evidence of delays. Recent demand has dropped sharply and remained low since Period 22. I will keep L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the sustained low-demand regime to avoid inflating orders based on earlier high-demand periods: mu_hat recent_N N=12 (Periods 22\u201333). Volatility reflects the same recent window: sigma_hat recent_N N=12. This reduces holding cost risk while matching current low sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg demand P22\u2013P33 = 27.33 (12 periods) vs prior recent avg \u2248313.6 (P7\u2013P11); sustained large decrease (~\u221291%), record as new sustained downward regime.

Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 22 (P22\u2013P33 avg \u224827.3 over 12 periods) \u2014 large, persistent drop vs earlier high-demand regimes. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and the sustained low-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand window. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures P22\u2013P33 regime length) so the OR engine computes base stock aligned to the new low regime and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=261, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 22 (Periods 22\u201333 avg \u224827.33) confirmed in carry-over; recent low demand persisted through Periods 34\u201335 (demand 3,3). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while respecting high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95), I set L to promised (default) and base demand forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained low-demand regime length (Periods 22\u201335 \u224814 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the current low-demand environment and avoids inflating forecast with earlier high-demand waves.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Current on-hand=257, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals when ordered). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 22 (many consecutive weeks with single/double-digit demand). To avoid excess holding cost while covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand, use recent data from the low-demand regime. I select L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (captures Periods 22\u201336 low-demand regime length = 15), so the OR backend will compute forecast and volatility based on the most relevant low-demand samples, reducing unnecessary replenishment and holding costs while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=252, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), and demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 22 (Periods 22\u201337 avg \u2248 27.33, more recent weeks much lower: P34\u2013P37 demands 3,3,4,5). To avoid overstock and high holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent regime (post-changepoint) data: mu_hat recent_N to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the low-demand regime; choose N=16 (Periods 22\u201337 available length =16) to capture the sustained downward regime. Similarly set sigma_hat recent_N with N=16 to reflect recent low volatility. These choices reduce ordering toward the new low-demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=247, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 22 (many consecutive small weekly sales: P22\u2013P38 mostly single- to low-double digits). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, capturing the last ~17 post-changepoint samples so the base stock will shrink and avoid unnecessary holding cost. Use default lead time (promised=0) since multiple concluded arrivals confirm L=0. These settings reduce order quantities to balance high per-unit profit against holding cost given the much lower recent demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=243, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently; demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 22 (many consecutive low-demand periods). To avoid excess holding cost while meeting low current demand, set L to promised (default) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default (promised lead time=0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=18 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 18 most recent low-demand samples (P22\u2013P39); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=18 to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstocking given long, sustained low-demand evidence and current high on-hand balance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=240, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1->P1 ... P3->P3 and documented in carry-over). Demand has moved into a sustained low regime since Period 34 (recent demands P34\u2013P40 = 3,3,4,5,5,4,3; regime length=7). I set L to default to use the promised/confirmed lead time=0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (N chosen = regime length, bounded by rules). These parameters focus the OR backend on the low recent demand to avoid overstocking (minimize holding cost) while preserving service given lead time=0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 22 (avg \u224827.3 over P22\u2013P33 and continued low through P41). On-hand=238, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs current low demand but holding cost applies. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods; no new evidence of change. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand parameters I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime length to capture the new lower mean/volatility: N=20 (P22\u2013P41 covers 20 periods). Using recent_Ns reduces forecast bias from earlier high-demand periods and lowers the backend base-stock target to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=234, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (sustained evidence P1->P1 through P3->P3 and multiple conclude messages showing 0). Demand collapsed starting Period 22 and has been stable at a low regime since (Periods 22\u201342 average demand \u224817.2 units/week; 21 samples). To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility), which the OR engine will scale by (1+L). This reduces target base-stock relative to historical high-demand periods and limits holding cost given plentiful on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=234, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 34 (recent weeks show very low weekly demand). To avoid overstock while meeting high target service level (q\u22480.95 given Profit=$19, Holding=$1), use promised lead time (default L=0) and compute demand forecast from the recent sustained low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=12 to capture the most recent low-demand 12-period regime (covers latest stable low-demand observations) so the OR backend will target a much lower base stock and reduce unnecessary holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2192P1..P3\u2192P3). Since Period 22 demand collapsed to a new, sustained low regime (many periods P22\u2013P44 with weekly demand mostly 0\u20135), I choose to forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, rules: N = min(regime_length,20), >=3) so the backend uses the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, ensuring orders reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid excessive holding cost given current on-hand=231 and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:

Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 22 (large drop vs earlier spikes); recent weeks demand is very low (many zeros and single-digit sales). Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 earlier and arrivals have consistently concluded with 0 lead time, so keep L as default (promised=0). To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained low-demand periods and limits influence of the earlier high-demand regime). These choices reduce forecasted order quantity, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand environment.

On-hand=229, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory versus current demand. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this avoids placing new replenishment given large on-hand and low realized demand.
