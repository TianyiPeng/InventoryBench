Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 506098007 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5): 12, 11, 48, 82, 59 showing a recent uptick but only 5 points \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. No concluded arrival messages to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and let backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance so the policy balances profit vs holding cost without overfitting to a short recent spike.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): recent on-hand=2, in-transit=0. Period 1 confirm: a large order (69) arrived same period and demand=67, leaving 2 on-hand. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224842.4 with elevated values in later weeks. Promised lead time=0 and the only concluded lead-time observation shows 0, so use calculated lead-time estimate. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the backend apply the z* safety-stock cap. Given current on-hand (2) and no pipeline, this parameterization will prompt an order roughly equal to one period's expected demand to restore target base-stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=1, in-transit=0; recent observed demands (concluded): Period1=67, Period2=71; historical Jan samples show lower values (12,11,48,82,59) indicating a regime uplift into Feb. Lead-time observations (Period1 and Period2 conclude) both show arrivals with lead_time=0, so use calculated lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while retaining some history, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last three demand observations: 2019-02-04:59, Period1:67, Period2:71). This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost; using recent data raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demand (Periods1-3) = [67,71,54], avg=64 over 3 periods, substantially above earlier sample mean=42.4. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed arrived same period), so use calculated lead time. There is a sustained demand regime increase (3 periods) so forecast (1+L)\xd7mean should use recent_N to capture the higher demand and avoid stockouts; volatility also derived from the same recent window to reflect current variability. Parameters chosen: L=calculate to confirm observed 0 lead-time; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to target current higher mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service level (reduce stockouts given higher demand) vs holding cost by using a short recent window rather than all historical data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1/2/3 orders arrived same period); Demand regime shift starting Period1: avg increased from 42.4 to 64 (+51.5%) sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime (Period1-4 avg demand \u224865; last 4 demands = 67,71,54,68). On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so immediate cover is low. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concludes confirm 0 actual lead time. To capture the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses last 4 samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals. This raises target base-stock to meet the higher demand while sigma recent_N increases safety stock, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) versus holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived same period). Recent on-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (game periods) show a sustained higher regime vs 2019 historical baseline; recent demand over last 5 periods = [67,71,54,68,54], regime length=5. To capture the new, higher demand I set L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility using the most recent 5-week regime. This raises target base stock to meet elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded history (Periods1-6) shows sustained higher demand vs. older samples (recent avg ~60+ vs historical 42.4) and all past orders arrived same period. On-hand=21, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and observed lead times = 0 consistently. I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-change regime (changepoint at Period1) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to service the higher sustained demand while keeping safety stock tied to recent variability, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (arrivals same period across concluded history). Recent demand shows a higher regime vs older baseline; last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) average demand ~56.8 with moderate variability. Use lead time = default (promised 0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 samples to capture the sustained elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older data. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost by basing forecast on recent regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1-8 arrivals same period). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime in the last 3 periods (Periods 6-8 demands = 49,59,85; recent mean \u224864), so I base forecast on the most recent regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent mean across (1+L) periods. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with current demand variability. This balances service (capture the recent spike) against holding cost by not over-weighting older, lower-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=23, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier sample (carry-over). I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher mean (Periods 5-9 mean \u224860.8) so mu_hat reflects current regime and avoids being pulled down by older low winter samples. I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (captures the large spike in Period 8). These choices raise the base-stock to improve service under the confirmed 0-LT and higher recent demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the OR engine's q parameter.

Recent demand elevated vs original samples \u2014 last 5 periods demands = {49,59,85,57,55}, mean \u2248 61. Use promised lead time (default) since arrivals historically same-period. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime (1+L times recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service while the OR backend will cap orders; this balances profit (higher fill) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand appears in a higher regime; last 5 concluded demands = [59,85,57,55,52], mean=61.6. I choose L=default to use promised (and observed) 0-period lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the recent sustained higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet a high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> q\u22480.8) while using recent data to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/6. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0; promised LT=0 so use default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 85,57,55,52,45) shows elevated regime vs earlier baseline; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility and avoid being pulled by older low-demand samples. This yields (1+L)*recent mean \u224858.8 demand forecast with recent volatility for safety stock; given profit $4 vs holding $1 (service quantile high), this supports a higher base stock to avoid costly stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=35, in-transit=0, recent demand has softened versus earlier spikes. Historical snapshot (Jan samples) mean=42.4 but recent 5-week demand (Periods 9-13 = 57,55,52,45,37) averages ~49.2. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance service (profit $4) vs holding ($1), I use a short recent demand window (captures current lower regime) and keep promised lead time. This yields responsive orders with demand-driven mu_hat and recent volatility for safety (sigma_hat).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals -> actual lead time confirmed 0. Recent demand (Periods 10-14 = 55,52,45,37,45) shows a lower, stable recent mean (~46.8) versus earlier higher regime; no overdue/lost shipments. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concludes confirm it. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the downward shift and avoids stale older samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps service level high (profit/holding -> q=0.8) but avoids overstocking against older, higher-demand regimes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spike: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201315) = [52,45,37,45,45], mean=44.8; use this recent window to capture current regime. Choose L=default to trust promised/observed 0 LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods using the current lower-demand regime and reduces overstock risk given holding cost >0. This also handles missing shipments (none recent) since LT confirmed 0 in concludes.

Profit=$4, Holding=$1 implies high target service level; using default L and demand statistics lets the OR backend compute base-stock and caps using full sample history.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 historically, so use default L (promised=0). To capture recent demand level and variability while remaining responsive to the surge in Period 20, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 samples).

Recent demand increased \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods17-21) = [37,21,38,89,110], mean \u224859, indicating a higher recent regime and elevated volatility. To reflect confirmed same-day arrivals and recent demand shift, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base forecast on the most recent regime (1+L times mean of last 5 samples). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock and cap to meet service during the higher-demand regime while controlling holding costs.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need immediate replenishment. I select L=default to trust the confirmed same-period lead time. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples (scaled by 1+L) to compute base stock and safety stock; this leverages the confirmed 0-period lead time and the full demand history to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time=0 (consistent across periods). Recent demand jumped sharply in Periods 20-24 (demands: 89,110,169,107,106; mean=116.2) versus earlier baseline (~40-70). I treat this as a new, sustained high-demand regime and use recent_N=5 to capture current mean/volatility. L set to default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility. This raises the base-stock to protect service level while the OR backend will cap orders to limit holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg increased from ~60 (prior periods) to 116.2 (+93.7%), sustained for 5 periods (Periods 20-24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals same period) and a clear demand regime shift starting Period 20: avg demand ~116 over Periods 20-24. Current on-hand=74, in-transit=0. No overdue/lost shipments. To reflect the higher recent demand I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the 5-period recent regime (Periods 20-24) so the OR backend targets inventory for the new higher mean and observed volatility. This balances service (capture ~116 mean) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run averages.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (arrivals same period) and recent demand regime increased sharply starting Period 20 (Periods 20-26 show higher, volatile demand). Pipeline is zero so orders must cover current-period demand. I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead times are 0 and stable. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 20-26) to capture the new high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand data. I apply recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant 7 samples, balancing higher service needs against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime increase around Period 20, but recent 4\u20135 weeks show demand softer than the peak (Period 24 high then decline). To balance service vs holding cost I keep lead time at promised (use default) and set demand forecast using a recent window to reflect the post-peak decline. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets stock for the latest demand level while preserving protection for short-term variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-July spike; last 4 demands = [68,59,55,57], mean\u224859.75. On-hand=44, in-transit=0 \u2192 cover next-period demand only (L=0). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower regime since Period 25 (regime length=4); mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples. Volatility also set to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability and avoid inflating safety stock from earlier spike. This balances service (covering ~1 period of ~60 units) against holding cost given on-hand inventory is already moderate.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical conclude data show consistent same-period arrivals -> lead time confirmed as 0. Demand increased sharply starting Period 20; recent 10-week mean (Periods 20-29) = 86.9 units/week. To reflect the new, sustained higher demand while keeping inventory response tight (L=0), I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock sized to the current high-demand regime and captures recent volatility (reducing stockouts while limiting holding cost).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand cooled after the mid-year peak: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 25-30) = [68,59,55,57,49,39], mean ~54.5. On-hand=80, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised/confirmed lead time 0 (default). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) anchored to the most recent 6 periods to reflect the post-peak lower-demand regime so the OR engine avoids overstock while maintaining service. Recent_N chosen N=6 to cover the most recent 6-week pattern but remain responsive to any regime reversion.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has fallen sharply from the mid-July spike (Periods 20-24 avg ~116) and the last 5 observed demands (Periods 27-31 = 55,57,49,39,29) average ~45.8. On-hand=51, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers ~1 week of current demand; no shipments overdue. Lead time history is consistent with 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). To adapt to the lower recent regime while still protecting service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent, clearly lower-demand regime (N=5 chosen because the last 5 periods show a sustained drop from the prior spike). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost exposure while allowing the OR backend's cap and service-level z* to preserve most sales given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 25: recent avg (Periods 27-31) ~45.8 vs prior spike avg 116.2 (\u221260.6%), sustained for 5 periods

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen from prior spikes: last 5 demands (Periods 28-32) ~= 57,49,39,29,31 => recent avg ~41; most recent 3 weeks even lower (~33). To avoid overstock given holding cost and lower recent demand, keep promised lead time (L=default) and let backend base stock reflect recent lower demand by using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets service while reducing excess inventory buildup when demand softened.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1-33 arrivals same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a large sale in Period 33 (d=142) following several low-to-moderate weeks; to capture this recent volatility and avoid stockouts while respecting holding costs, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples include the Period33 spike). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean that reflects the recent spike and a matching recent volatility; with profit/holding ratio (q=0.8) the engine will target a high service level but the recent_N choice prevents over-relying on distant history.

Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 29,31,142,63,44) shows a short spike at P33 but the last five periods best represent current regime. To avoid overreacting to a single large outlier, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest regime. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) to match observed deliveries. This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0. Recent demand has a noisy spike at Period 33 (142) but the last 3 demand observations (Periods 34-36 = 63,44,47) indicate a lower post-spike regime. To avoid overstating demand from the isolated spike, set L to default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent stable 3-week average (captures post-spike mean ~51). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (cover immediate demand) versus holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0; recent demand (Periods 33-37 = 52,63,44,47,40) shows a lower, stable regime with mean ~49.2 over 5 periods. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, which reduces overstock risk while maintaining service for the observed demand level.

To avoid excess holding while preserving high service (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8), set L to default (promised 0).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=0 (confirmed in prior periods) and demand has settled to the lower post-spike regime (~40-50 units/week) since Period 25. To avoid overstock given holding cost and current modest on-hand, keep promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the recent demand window (Periods 31-39, N=9) to reflect the current regime while limiting influence of the single large spike at Period 33. This balances service (capturing recent mean) against holding cost by shrinking forecast window to recent behavior.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 37-40) has been low-to-moderate (40,46,30,22) after earlier spikes; no new sustained regime shift detected. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 use default promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand while still preserving service (profit/holding implies high fill target), set mu_hat using a recent_N=5 sample window to capture the latest regime; keep sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability over (1+L). This keeps orders conservative given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=46, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming stock expected this period. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has trended down modestly (periods 37-41 demand: 40,46,30,22,18) but not a clearly sustained regime shift beyond previously recorded insights. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given current moderate on-hand and uncertain short-term decline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0). Recent demand has dropped from prior spikes; last 5 demands (Periods 38-42) = [46,30,22,18,33], indicating a lower recent mean. To reflect confirmed zero lead time and the recent lower-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples so the OR engine targets stock for the current low-demand regime while preserving service level given profit/holding (q=0.8). This reduces excess holding from older high-demand spikes while maintaining coverage for (1+L) periods and demand variability observed in the last 5 weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen vs earlier spikes (last 5 concluded demands: 30,22,18,33,9), so I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the lower current regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This biases orders toward lower replenishment to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 41-45) = [18,33,9,8,20], recent mean ~17.6. To reflect the new low regime and prioritize avoiding excess holding while keeping a high service target (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8), I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor to the latest regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to current low demand and avoids overstock given zero in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 41: avg declined from ~45.8 (prior recent) to 17.6 over Periods 41-45 (\u221261.6%), sustained for 5 periods
