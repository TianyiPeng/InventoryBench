Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows low values (2019-01-07=18, 2019-01-14=20) then a sustained higher regime (2019-01-21=99, 2019-01-28=72, 2019-02-04=68). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next period demand. No concluded arrival messages exist, so do not adjust promised lead time. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (no evidence to change). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)*mean of last 3 weeks \u224879.67) and the same recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to protect service while keeping holding cost in mind given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=19, recent avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=79.67 (+320%)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data shows a clear demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent weekly avg \u224879.7 vs prior \u224819). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; last period's order (108) arrived same-period confirming actual lead time = 0 so far. I set L to default (promised 0) consistent with observed lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned to observed arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): recent weeks show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Observed concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived same period (lead_time observed=0). I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (the post-changepoint samples 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) so mu_hat targets the higher regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping variability estimates focused on the new regime to limit excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2634.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P3 arrived same period). Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 (recent weekly avg \u224879.7 from samples 99,72,68). On-hand=83, in-transit=0 which is roughly one week of recent demand; to maintain service and capitalize on high profit ($19) while holding cost is low ($1), I set lead time to the recent average (0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align forecast and variability with the new high-demand regime. This reduces stockout risk without overstating variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3220.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand has been high and elevated vs. historical pre-shift data (recent demands: P2=185, P3=143, P4=171). On-hand=29, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed concluded lead times P1\u2013P4 = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the last 3 demand samples to reflect current volatility and mean). These parameters raise the base-stock to support service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost consideration via the OR backend formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2438.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand regime is the higher regime identified earlier (post-2019-01-21); recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u20135) are: 133,185,143,171,132. On-hand=70, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty so we must order to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded arrivals, so set L to the observed average. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. These params direct the OR backend to size base-stock to recent demand levels (improving service during the high regime) while sigma based on recent volatility balances safety stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1\u2013P5 orders arrived same period)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time confirmed as 0 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning 2019-01-21. Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20136) = [133,185,143,171,132,93]; regime length = 6. To reflect the confirmed zero lead time and the elevated recent demand while keeping responsiveness to the modest downward drift, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 6 realized demands (captures the new regime). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the confirmed high-demand regime and maintain service while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-01. On-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand peaked around 2019-01-21 then declined; recent sales (Periods 3\u20137) = [143,171,132,93,73], indicating a lower recent mean and reduced variance. To keep orders aligned with recent demand and avoid holding cost while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base forecast on the last five demand periods, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times show consistently 0 (P1\u2013P8 arrivals same period). Recent demand has declined from the large regime jump in Jan: last 5 concluded demands = [171,132,93,73,74] (Periods 4\u20138) indicating a lower recent mean. I keep L = default (promised 0, validated by past concludes). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime rather than the earlier spike; with L=0 this translates to (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce orders relative to the earlier high-demand regime, lowering holding cost while preserving service given observed 0 lead time and recent demand evidence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weeks show demand around 70\u2013133 with on-hand=46 and in-transit=0. Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Cost tradeoff: profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a high service target (q\u22480.95). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend produce the high base-stock and cap consistent with the profit/holding tradeoff. This keeps ordering responsive to the confirmed zero lead time while letting the backend set safety stock for the high profit margin. Current on-hand (46) plus no pipeline implies we may order to replenish to the calculated base stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 6\u201310) = [93,73,74,133,100], recent mean \u224894.6. On-hand=85, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically confirmed 0). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use a short-term recent demand estimate: set L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current post-changepoint regime (N=5 covers the last 5 periods where demand stabilized). This raises forecast to match current demand volatility and keeps orders aligned with observed sales, balancing profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 (orders P1\u2013P11 all arrived same period). Demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21; use recent post-change data to forecast. Set L by 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=9 (post-changepoint samples P3\u2013P11) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the higher regime and limits overstock from older low-demand samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR backend base-stock to recent higher demand while keeping holding cost exposure moderate given ample on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/06. Recent concluded history (Periods 3\u201312) shows steady demand in the ~70\u2013133 range after the Jan regime shift; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded messages. To reflect confirmed 0 LT and recent demand regime, set L via observed lead times and base demand on the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current mean/volatility. This raises target base-stock to maintain high service (profit/holding implies high service level) while keeping sigma estimated from recent variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P13), so use promised/default L=0. Demand shows a sustained downward shift after the high early peaks; recent 8-period window (Periods 6\u201313 demands = 93,73,74,133,100,56,89,75) better reflects current regime, so use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility. This keeps base-stock sized for current demand while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent weekly demand has been moderate-to-high with last 5 demands = [100,56,89,75,100], recent mean \u2248 84. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime and avoid diluting with early low samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend focused on current demand patterns (raising service for recent higher demand) while avoiding excessive holding by using only recent variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods consistently. Demand has remained in the higher regime since 2019-01-21; to reflect current weekly demand behavior I use recent samples rather than all-time average. Set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the replenishment (1+L review+lead demand and volatility) on the last 15 demand observations so the OR backend targets service with current demand while limiting holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has since stabilized around ~75\u2013100 units/week; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N on the most recent 8 demand observations to set forecast mean and volatility. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent demand and variance rather than older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P17). There is a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent mean much higher). Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike (Period 17 demand=198). To prioritize service (profit $19 > holding $1) and avoid stockouts after the spike, I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the latest regime (captures the high recent mean and variance). Lead time uses default (promised=0) consistent with observed arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201319). Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has remained at a higher level; recent weeks show variable but elevated demand (several peaks e.g. P17 demand=198, P18=102, P19=107). No overdue shipments. I keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while prioritizing recent behavior, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (uses the last 12 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This raises the base-stock to reflect the new regime and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level (high profit) vs. holding cost (low $1/unit).

Demand regime shift in Jan 2019 (higher mean since 2019-01-21) is already recorded; no new sustained changepoint in recent periods. Use default lead time to match promised 0 and prior confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set while the backend's capped policy limits extreme orders and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and variable weekly demand with a previously recorded persistent regime shift starting 2019-01-21. Current on-hand=69, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed LT=0 and steady arrival reliability, use promised/default lead time so backend treats L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full historical samples\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample demand estimate including the higher recent regime) against holding cost while leveraging confirmed zero lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (no evidence of lost shipments); demand shows the earlier regime shift (Jan) but since then weekly demand fluctuates without a new sustained change. Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed 0 L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given stable lead time and no new sustained demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=35, in-transit=0 -> risk of stockout this period. Historical concludes show consistently zero actual lead time; pipeline empty. Profit >> holding (19 vs 1) implies target service level ~95%. Use promised lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned and exploit confirmed fast arrivals. Set demand forecast using recent data to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21; use recent_N=20 to reflect the most recent weeks and reduce dilution from early low samples. Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters increase base-stock to protect service level while keeping holding cost in check.

No overdue shipments visible. To balance service level vs holding cost I use promised lead time (default=0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples (default) so base-stock reflects full historical mean/variance while keeping holding exposure explicit to the optimizer.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent weeks show a stable, higher-demand regime vs. early Jan; to focus forecast on current behavior I use recent 20 weeks of demand to estimate mean and volatility. Using L=default (promised=0) keeps OR engine consistent with observed deliveries; recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures latest regime and reduces influence of early low-demand samples, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: P24\u2013P28 = 75,135,146,143,107) averages ~121 units/week, clearly above early-sample mean due to the sustained regime shift noted earlier. Use L=default (promised 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to center the base-stock on the current high-demand regime and capture recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given low holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent history shows sustained higher post-Jan-21 demand vs the early Jan baseline; on-hand=45, in-transit=0 so no incoming units visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 10 demand observations, capturing the current higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand weeks. I also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices keep replenishment responsive to the confirmed higher demand and keep holding costs controlled by using a recent-window forecast rather than the long-run mean.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period delivery (lead time 0) and recent demand (last ~20 weeks) centers around ~100\u2013140 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), I use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates from the recent 20-period regime to avoid overweighting the early 2019 spike. recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant data, keeping service high while limiting excess inventory.

Recent demand has been higher and more stable than older samples (last 5 demands: 143,107,126,112,147; recent mean \u2248127), and prior carry-over confirmed a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 and confirmed lead time=0. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use promised/default lead time (0) and base forecasts on the most recent regime (recent_N, N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets inventory appropriate for current demand volatility and level.

Recent demand shows a moderately elevated regime; last 5 weekly demands = {107,126,112,147,81}, mean=114.6, sample std\u224824.36. Profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95). I set L=default to trust confirmed same-period arrivals, mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last period saw a large demand spike (282) but historicals since 2019-01-21 show a sustained higher-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. To adapt to recent higher demand while smoothing the single extreme spike, I set mu_hat using an EWMA (gamma=0.3) so recent weeks matter more but noise is damped. sigma_hat uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to provide a conservative uncertainty estimate for the OR backend. These parameters prioritize serving demand (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while limiting overreaction to a single-period outlier.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14. On-hand=191, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift since 2019-01-21 (higher mean). Recent 10-week demand (Periods 26\u201335) mean \u2248134.7 with one large spike (282 in P33) but overall elevated compared with early history. Profit/holding imply a high service quantile (q\u22480.95). Set L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated regime while including the P33 spike to reflect realized variability; this balances service (high z*) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Period 33 demand=282 spike, Periods 34\u201336 large replenishments and mixed demand 116,87,131). To capture the recent higher/variable demand regime while avoiding overreacting to a single spike, I use a recent-N forecast over the last 8 periods to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Promised lead time has been historically confirmed as 0; use default lead time so OR backend treats arrivals as same-period. This balances service (covers recent higher demand) vs holding cost by focusing on the recent regime rather than all older low-demand periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent every period). Demand has stayed in a higher regime since 2019-01-21; use recent samples to reflect current regime and reduce influence of pre-shift low values. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 20 demand observations and reflect current mean/volatility for (1+L) review+lead period. This balances service (captures elevated recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent-regime stats rather than long-run average.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover demand + service. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 and a sustained higher-demand regime that began 2019-01-21. To reflect the sustained regime while anchoring to the most recent behavior, I use recent_N (N=20) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent 20 samples (captures seasonal and elevated demand including recent spikes) and use default lead time (promised=0, confirmed historically). This balances service (capture recent high mean) vs holding cost by using recent sample stats rather than inflating with long-ago low-demand periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=133, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time=0. I choose L=default to use promised (and observed) same-period arrivals. Demand has shown recent high variability and bursts (Sept/Oct spikes); to weight recent weeks more while retaining smoothing, I select an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3. Sigma_hat use default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These settings bias orders toward recent demand increases while the backend cap limits extreme replenishment and controls holding cost versus service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile vs early samples; to reflect current regime I use the last 5 weeks for demand forecast. L set to default (promised=0) to leverage confirmed lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level and volatility, balancing service (profit $19) versus low holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=203, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (through P41) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and the earlier demand regime shift (higher mean from 2019-01-21 onward) persists in observed weekly sales. With same-period arrivals and no outstanding pipeline, use promised/default lead time to align with observed 0. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this balances service (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overfitting to recent spikes given substantial historical variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent weeks much larger than initial two samples) and many recent high-demand weeks (including large single-week spikes around Sep/Oct/Nov). No new lead-time issues visible; past conclues confirm lead time = 0. To be responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-window demand estimate so the base-stock reflects current demand levels. L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent demand mean and volatility (N=20 balances recency with variance reduction given ample history). This produces a base_stock tuned to current demand spike while sigma_hat captures recent variability for safety stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=183, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Demand shows a prior sustained regime shift (higher mean from Jan 21 onward) but recent weeks are variable (including a one-off 204 spike in Period 42). I keep L as default (promised) because concluded history confirms 0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments. For demand forecast I use an EWMA to balance the long-run elevated regime with recent volatility (gamma=0.3) so mu_hat reacts slowly to one-off spikes while reflecting the higher baseline. For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock calculation. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the elevated regime while avoiding overreaction to isolated large-week demand, helping trade off service level vs. holding cost given a high profit/holding ratio.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm sustained zero actual lead time; no recent lost shipments. Demand shows a large earlier regime shift (Jan\u2013Feb) but recent weeks (Periods 40\u201344 demands = 77,61,204,47,57) are volatile with one large stockout-driven spike (204). To be responsive to current seasonality and recent low weekly demand while still capturing recent variability, set L to default (promised=0) and use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This biases orders toward recent demand while retaining overall volatility estimate; combined with high profit/low holding (service target ~95%) this supports high fill rates without excessive explicit increases to safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P45). Recent weekly demand (periods 41\u201345) is lower (~50s) except Period 42 which was a stockout-driven 204; to avoid bias from that stockout I use a short recent window to capture current December demand levels. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect current low-season demand (short window to react to seasonality). Use sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample variability scaled by (1+L). These choices keep service high this season while avoiding excessive holdings given holding cost $1/unit/period and profit $19/unit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand shows a sharp spike in Period 42 (204 units) followed by a lower regime (Periods 43-46: 47,57,54,23). On-hand = 149, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Given the post-spike lower demand regime (likely post-promotion/holiday) I use a recent-N forecast focused on the most recent stable periods to avoid over-ordering. L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture the reduced demand (Periods 43-46). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock relative to using the large spike, lowering holding cost while maintaining high service (profit/ (profit+holding)=19/20 => high target service level).
