Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) averages ~80 units/week with no evidence of a regime shift or seasonal event before mid-February. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals to reconcile or overdue shipments to flag. Profit/holding ratio (4/1) implies a high service target; however, with no observed lead-time deviations or demand changepoints, use defaults so the OR engine applies its standard (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std formulas and its capped order logic.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 order (87) arrived in-period (conclude shows lead_time=0) and stockout occurred (demand 97, sold 87). No multi-period evidence of lead-time drift or sustained demand shift. Use default lead time (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (keeps forecast anchored to available 5-sample history while backend applies service-level cap). This balances service level (avoid further stockouts) with holding cost given limited evidence to alter estimates.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times from concluded periods: 0 and 0 (orders placed in P1/P2 arrived same period). Demand has stepped up recently (97 \u2192 171), suggesting possible regime shift but only one high-demand period so far. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias forecasts toward the most recent data (captures emerging higher demand while retaining some smoothing). This balances service level (respond to spike) against holding cost given limited evidence of sustained change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concludes show actual lead time = 0 for Periods 1\u20133 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history includes provided weekly samples and recent sells (97,171,105) with a short-lived spike in Period 2 but not a sustained regime change. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy simple given consistent observed lead time and avoids overreacting to a single high-demand week, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [71,79,82,90,80], mean=80.4. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20134), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Current on-hand=51, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments visible. Use L=calculate to reflect observed lead time=0; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that matches observed demand while accounting for variability and holding cost (profit/holding=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P5 arrived same period). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; recent demand (P1-P5) has varied but shows no sustained regime shift (weekly demands: 97,171,105,73,72 plus earlier Jan samples ~71-90). I keep L at promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all available samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std \u2014 this balances service level using the empirical mean/variance without overreacting to short noisy spikes, while avoiding extra holding cost from explicit over-forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent concluded history shows six periods with lead_time=0 for all observed orders, and demand has dropped and stabilized in the last 3 periods (P4-6). On-hand=51, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected. I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower-demand regime (use P4-6 average) so the OR engine reduces target inventory and avoids excess holding cost. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced recent variability. This balances service vs holding given current low demand and zero observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand decreased from 124.33 (Periods 1-3) to 70.67 (Periods 4-6), a -43.2% drop (sustained 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent confirmed demand regime drop (Periods 4-6) to ~71 units/week sustained for 3 periods; all observed lead times = 0. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so available supply is very low vs weekly demand (~70). Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed actual=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, lower demand regime (use last 3 periods after the detected changepoint) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to match the current lower mean and its volatility, reducing overstock risk while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 4 (carry-over already recorded). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 (orders arrived same period), so use default promised L. To respect the recent lower-demand regime and one large spike in Period 8, I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 6-8 = 67,71,139). This balances responsiveness to the spike while reflecting the new lower mean, helping the OR backend compute a base-stock that trades service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained drop at Period 4 (Periods 4-6 avg ~70.7) with subsequent variability including a spike in Period 8 (139). To be responsive to the recent post-change regime while smoothing the Period 8 spike, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (last 5 periods: P5-P9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent behavior. Keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded messages show consistent 0 lead time in history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand has been volatile: recent three-period regime (Periods 4\u20136) showed a sustained drop vs earlier, and subsequent periods (7\u201310) mixed with a large spike in Period 8. Current on-hand=38, in-transit=0. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded evidence confirms 0. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting it balance forecast and safety stock automatically given observed variability and the profit/holding tradeoff. This avoids overfitting to the volatile recent spike while respecting confirmed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/29 (Period 12). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments). A prior demand regime shift (Periods 4-6) is known but subsequent periods (7-11) show mixed recovery, not a new sustained regime. To avoid overfitting to short fluctuations, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service vs. holding cost given limited new evidence.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (Periods 4-12 show lower mean vs Periods 1-3). On-hand=42, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. I keep lead time as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show 0. To capture the new, lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and variability using the most recent regime (Periods 4-12, length=9 \u2192 N=9). These parameters bias orders toward the current lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while preserving service.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has stabilized at a lower regime (carry-over noted: drop around Period 4). On-hand=35, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. For demand forecast, use recent_N (last 6 periods) to capture the current lower-demand regime and avoid inflation from earlier high periods. Use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent variability. This keeps base-stock aligned to current demand, balancing service (profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default L. Recent demand has been lower than early-period levels (carry-over noted: sustained drop starting Period 4). Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11-15 reads): 80,71,64,49, (Period15 demand unknown yet) \u2014 using recent_N=5 to anchor forecast to the lower regime and reduce overstock. I select L=default to reflect observed zero lead time; mu_hat recent_N=5 to capture the recent lower demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings lower the base-stock target to balance service vs holding cost given current on-hand inventory and absent in-transit units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so keep L default (promised=0). Demand shows a sustained downward regime detected earlier (carry-over). To be responsive to recent lower demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent data: use recent_N with N=5 (captures latest 5 demand observations to reflect the lowered mean/variance and avoids overweighting earlier higher-demand regime). This tightens the base-stock target to reduce holding cost while keeping service given current demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical demand shows a sustained regime drop starting Period 4 (already recorded); to reflect the lower recent mean I use recent_N for demand parameters. Regime length since Period 4 is 13 periods, so N=13 (capped rules applied). This keeps base_stock responsive to the lower-demand regime while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility and avoid overstock given holding cost >0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0). Historical demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (as previously recorded). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use the promised lead time and compute demand across the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default to trust promised 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (covers Periods 4\u201317, the sustained lower-demand regime) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the recent regime and reduces base-stock relative to earlier high-demand periods. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by lowering target stock given the confirmed drop in demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 across all periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. To avoid overfitting recent noise and because promised lead time = 0 matches observed history, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without adding extra holding risk.

Recent demand (Periods 19-23 = 99,162,111,91,84) is materially higher and more variable than the earlier low regime identified at Period 4; on-hand=52, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed (all historical lead_times = 0). To capture the recent uptick and volatility, set lead time to promised (default = 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the latest demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. This balances service for recent higher demand spikes and avoids carrying too much inventory based on older low-demand periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has risen in July (last 5 demands: 162,111,91,84,129 \u2192 mean \u2248115) versus earlier months. On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so no upcoming arrivals; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default because all concluded orders show actual lead_time=0 historically (no evidence of drift). To capture the recent July demand spike and short review+lead window, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on last 5 weeks). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward meeting elevated near-term demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows consistently observed lead_time=0 in concluded messages; demand appears stable around historical sample mean. On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so we keep promised lead time to match observed behavior and avoid overcorrecting for delays. Use default L to let backend use promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given the steady demand evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=60, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period (lead_time=0) arrivals. No overdue shipments. Profit/holding implies high target service level (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) but the OR backend computes base-stock from supplied demand stats. I select default lead time (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L); this is appropriate given no new sustained regime change since prior recorded insight and avoids overfitting to recent noise. These settings balance service level vs holding cost via the backend's base-stock formula.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 84,129,75,53,53) shows lower mean and volatility vs earlier high-variance regime; to keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use a recent-window forecast focusing on latest 5 weeks. L uses promised/observed 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to reflect current lower demand and volatility so the backend's base-stock and cap produce moderate replenishment.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead_time consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default. Recent demand has settled lower after the earlier regime shift (recent 5 demands: 129,75,53,53,50; mean=72) so I use recent_N=5 to capture the new level and recent volatility. High profit vs holding (q\u22480.8) implies aiming for high service; recent_N estimates reduce overstock risk from older high-demand weeks while keeping service via OR's safety-stock term.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 4 (already recorded). No evidence of changed lead time (all concluded lead_times = 0). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). To adapt to the lower demand regime, use recent demand for forecasting: mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (captures latest 5 weeks' mean and reflects current lower demand). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps orders responsive to current lower demand and limits excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand has been moderate (last months mostly 50\u201390/week) and historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low; no overdue shipments observed. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (historical confirms). To focus the forecast on the recent regime (post-regime-shift earlier in the year) I set mu_hat=recent_N using the last 20 demand samples to capture recent mean demand without over-weighting early high-demand weeks. sigma_hat=default uses overall sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service (using recent mean) vs holding cost by avoiding carryover of older high-demand regime data while keeping variability conservative.

A demand regime shift was previously recorded (Periods 4-6 lower demand) and no new sustained change is evident in the most recent concluded periods. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the embedded service-level formula (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5) balance fill rate vs. holding cost.

I keep L='default' (promised 0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=21, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (recorded previously). To keep orders aligned with recent sales and limit holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current demand level and volatility. This reduces risk of overstock from older high-demand periods while allowing the OR backend to compute service-level adjusted base-stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for all observed orders, and no new sustained demand regime shift since prior carry-over insight. Use default L to match promised/observed lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, yielding a balanced base-stock that reflects long-run demand and the profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand history shows stable weekly samples with no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded drop at Period 4. To let the OR backend use full-sample statistics and promised lead time, set L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default. This keeps ordering anchored to the long-run mean while avoiding overreaction to short fluctuations given no incoming pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods: P34-P39 demand = 90,81,54,105,127,80; mean \u224889.5) better reflects current demand than the full-history mean given past regime shifts. On-hand=29, in-transit=0; using L=default (promised 0) keeps pipeline aligned with observed arrivals. I choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to recent demand volatility and mean, reducing overstock from older high-demand periods while preserving service. No evidence of new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes since the previously recorded shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded drop at Period 4. On-hand=40, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L=promised(0). To make the forecast responsive to recent seasonality (autumn into holiday weeks) I use recent demand for both mean and volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures the last ~3 months of weekly data to reflect current demand level while smoothing week-to-week noise). These parameters give the OR backend a current-period lead time (0) and a demand forecast focused on the recent regime so orders will better balance service (high profit/higher target fill) versus holding cost given limited on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. No overdue arrivals observed; historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0. Prior carry-over flagged a sustained demand regime shift at Period 4 (lower mean since Periods 4-6 onward). To reflect the persistent post-shift regime while giving weight to the most recent data, I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates with N=20 (cap on recent regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 20 demand samples. This balances service level (captures recent lower-demand regime) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from older, higher-demand eras.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have all been 0 periods \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Recent demand history shows a large one-period spike (Period 42 demand=243, likely Black Friday) but otherwise stable weekly demand; this looks like a short holiday spike, not a sustained regime change. To let the OR backend compute service-level-aware targets while avoiding overstock after the spike, use default demand and volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and preserves responsiveness if actual lead time or demand regime shifts are later confirmed via conclude messages.

Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand drop identified earlier at Period 4; recent weeks include a large one-off spike (Period 42: 243) likely promotional. No new sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time (default L=0) so OR backend treats arrivals as same-period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding given limited on-hand inventory and the prior sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent history shows a clear Nov-Dec demand spike (Periods 42-44: 243,112,118). All observed lead times = 0 historically. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for immediate demand. I set L=default (use promised 0) because concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the holiday-updated mean over the most recent five weeks (Periods 40-44) so mu_hat reflects the elevated seasonal demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility during the spike. These choices bias the base-stock and cap upward to prioritize service during the confirmed seasonal spike while the recent_N volatility estimate moderates over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal spike confirmed: Periods 42-44 (2019-11-25 to 2019-12-09) avg demand = 157.7 vs prior 6-period avg 87.8 (+79.8%), sustained 3 periods.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a short seasonal spike in Periods 42-44 followed by a return to lower demand in Period 45; the spike is already recorded in carry-over. No new sustained demand or lead-time change (need 3+ periods) so I keep conservative defaults. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical mean and std to compute base-stock and cap, balancing service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent history shows a seasonal spike in late Nov\u2013early Dec recorded in carry-over; no new sustained changepoint detected. Use default demand/volatility methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical data while the high profit/holding ratio (q=0.8) will drive a relatively high service level via z* in the backend.
