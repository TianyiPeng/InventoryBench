Given current on-hand 37, that raw target would imply ordering ~72. However, holding cost is material and recent two periods (P25\u2013P26) fell to 75 and 53, so I reduce exposure to avoid per-period holding costs. Compromise: order 50 units to bring on-hand+order to 87 \u2014 slightly above the recent 4-period mean (~85), providing reasonable protection against moderate spikes while limiting holding cost.

Recent seasonal evidence: Dec peak confirmed earlier (Periods 42\u201344 high demand) but Period 45 demand dropped to 70; demand this week (2019-12-23) is uncertain but on-hand 88 provides substantial coverage for a single-period demand spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: conclude messages through Period 46 show all orders arriving same period they were ordered \u2192 actual lead time = 0 (matches carry-over insight). Inventory: on-hand=46, in-transit=0; with lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive this period and be available for Period 47 demand. Demand outlook: recent weeks show a Dec holiday peak (P42\u2013P44) then a sharp decline (P45=70, P46=42). OR recommends 72 using historical average and promised lead time; that recommendation would raise available inventory to 118, likely leaving substantial ending inventory given the post-peak demand drop. Cost tradeoff: profit = $4/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 high service target (q=0.8) but with evident decline in demand after the Dec surge, stocking the full OR amount risks unnecessary holding costs. Decision: order 60 units to bring available inventory to 106 (46+60) which balances covering residual holiday sales risk while limiting surplus holding cost exposure given the downward trend. This modest reduction from OR's 72 reflects observed demand softening after the peak while still preserving high service given profit > holding cost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 72\u219260: lead time=0 so order arrives this period; demand has pulled back after the Dec peak (P45=70, P46=42), so order slightly lower to avoid excess holding while keeping good service.",
