Recent regime shows a clear uptick: last 3 weeks avg = (128+120+190)/3 = 146 units/week vs prior two-week avg = (98+95)/2 = 96 (~+52%). Lead time & pipeline: promised lead_time=0 but no concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no confirmed faster/slower lead-time signal. Risk: if actual lead_time>0, orders may not arrive this period \u2014 but no evidence to assume delays. Inventory decision: aim to meet expected near-term demand (capture high margin $4/unit) while limiting holding cost $1/unit/period. Final order logic: plan for the elevated demand (~146) and Valentine uplift \u2014 round up to cover peak observed week (190) with small safety buffer. Order 200 units to satisfy expected period demand while keeping holding cost exposure moderate.",
