Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (98,95,128,120,190) give mean ~126.2 and moderate variability. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need immediate coverage; promised lead time is 0 so orders theoretically arrive same period. No concluded arrivals to suggest changed lead time or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample; this balances service (cover typical weekly demand ~126) against holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows the P1 order (159) arrived in P1 => observed lead time = 0 (matches promised). Historical weekly demand samples mean \u2248126.2 (samples: 98,95,128,120,190). No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised (0). This keeps policy simple, avoids overreacting to a single large demand period (week with 190), and lets the backend cap orders appropriately.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two very large weekly demands (292, 265) versus historical baseline (mean 126.2 from Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Both concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 so far. To adapt quickly to the recent upward demand while remaining conservative (only 2 high-demand periods observed), I set L to calculate (use observed lead times = 0). I use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.6 to place substantial weight on recent high demand but retain some baseline influence. I keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since volatility evidence is mixed and only two high points exist. These choices raise the target base-stock to respond to the spike while avoiding overcommitment if the surge is short-lived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $670.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all arrived with lead time 0 (consistent with promised L=0). Recent selling demand in concluded periods 1\u20133 (292, 265, 194) is substantially higher than the provided baseline samples (mean=126.2). I treat this as a sustained upward demand regime (3 periods) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 observed demand samples to capture the new mean/volatility. L kept as default (promised lead time=0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend raises target base stock to meet the higher service requirement while the z* calculation balances profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1\u20133: baseline avg=126.2 (Jan samples) \u2192 recent avg=250.33 (Periods 1\u20133), +98.1% sustained over 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 all arrived same period). On-hand=125, in-transit=0. Demand has recently been elevated vs Jan baseline but the last three concluded demands (P2\u2013P4: 265,194,168) show a tapering from the early spike. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time (0) from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (short-term average demand \u2248209 units over last 3 periods) so mu_hat reflects current demand levels without being overly influenced by older low-Jan samples. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock focused on the current elevated-but-decelerating demand, limit overstock risk given holding cost, and leverage confirmed lead-time=0 so orders can replenish same period as placed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5): 292,265,194,168,150 \u2014 a spike in early periods followed by a taper. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculated average lead time. To reflect the recent elevated but now-decelerating demand pattern, forecast using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime (reduces influence of older low-Jan samples). Use the same recent-5 window for volatility to match demand variability. These choices give the OR backend an L reflecting observed operations and mu/sigma that prioritize service for the recent higher-demand episodes while limiting excess holding costs as demand has softened.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1\u20136), so use observed-average lead time. Demand has shifted up vs. Jan baseline and recent weeks show variability; I use the most recent 3 weeks (Periods 4\u20136: 168,150,233) to capture the current regime for forecast mean and volatility. This keeps supply responsive to the recent elevated/volatile demand while limiting excess holding given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (high service weight).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows every observed order arrival had lead_time=0, so set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20137) is elevated vs. earlier Jan samples; to capture the sustained higher regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (uses last 7 demand samples) so the base-stock and cap reflect current higher mean and volatility and avoid understocking while controlling holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been high and volatile (last 3 concluded demands: 233, 248, 313). All concluded orders show lead_time=0 consistently. To replenish for the current elevated demand regime, I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirming 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained higher recent mean (~264.7 units). Sigma_hat uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains full historical volatility while the mean reflects the recent regime. This balances service level (capture recent high demand) against holding cost by not overreacting to a single period spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) shows every order arrived same-period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). Recent realized demand across Periods 1\u201312 averages ~224.25 units/period, substantially above the Jan baseline; no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded shift. To be robust and aligned with observed data, set lead time to the calculated average of observed lead times (confirming 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set (captures the sustained higher demand and overall volatility). This balances service (captures realized demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent zero actual lead time and recent weekly demand has settled below earlier peaks. On-hand=85, in-transit=0 \u2192 need to replenish for the coming week. I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals). To capture the current demand regime I use recent_N (last 5 concluded weekly demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets reflect the most recent demand level (reducing overstock risk) while the OR backend will apply the high service-factor implied by profit/holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent weeks (Periods 10\u201314) show stable weekly demand around ~166\u2013211 (no new sustained changepoint). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). On-hand=47, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for expected next-period demand. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand to focus the forecast on the latest stable regime: choose N=5 (Periods 10\u201314) to capture current weekly mean (~186) and volatility. This balances service level against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand rather than older samples that include earlier regime shifts.

Recent demand has varied but shows no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded change. Use default lead time so backend uses promised L=0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) through its q = profit/(profit+holding) calculation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P16 arrived same period) \u2014 confirm actual lead time = 0, so use promised/default L. Recent demand (Periods 9\u201316) shows weekly demand ~166\u2013313 with last 8 demands = [240,202,175,211,166,177,216,220]; using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses forecast on the latest regime and reduces influence of early-Jan outliers. This produces (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflecting current sales; with profit=$4 and holding=$1 this balances service level vs holding cost by concentrating safety stock on recent observed variability.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P14\u2013P18 = 177,216,220,181,125) averaged ~183.8, slightly below longer-run mean; no evidence of lost shipments. To focus the OR engine on the most recent regime while keeping lead time at the promised value, I use default lead time and recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the last 5 weeks of demand and covers the current period's demand without excess holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=64, in-transit=0; recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 (consistent over history), so use promised lead time. I choose L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201320 demands: 220,181,125,204,158 => mean ~177.6) so mu_hat reflects current demand level and avoids legacy high values. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep service high (profit/holding -> q=0.8 handled by backend) while avoiding overstock from older high-demand periods; explicit handling of missing in-transit units is unnecessary since no shipments are outstanding.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=182, in-transit=0 \u2014 current inventory already covers ~1.5 weeks at recent rates. Promised lead time has consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (focus on the recent lower-demand regime). These parameters bias the OR backend toward smaller replenishment given high on-hand, balancing service level (profit-driven q\u22480.8) against holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. Recent weekly demand has declined vs. early-period spike; last 6 demand samples (Periods 18\u201323) average ~100 units/week. On-hand=147, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time (default). To capture the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current regime, reducing overstock risk given holding cost $1/unit. This balances service vs. holding given empty pipeline and moderate on-hand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has declined sharply in summer: last 4 weeks demand = [79,55,35,23] and last 8 weeks = [181,125,204,158,79,55,35,23], indicating a new low-demand regime. On-hand=141, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage for near-term but we must reduce target baseline to avoid excess holding cost. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I select recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent downshift while retaining some smoothing from earlier weeks; sigma_hat also recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices lower the base stock to align orders with the sustained summer slowdown, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given current on-hand inventory.

Recent demand has trended lower since mid-June / July (many weeks with demands 79,55,35,23,17), so avoid inflating forecasts \u2014 use backend's default (all-sample) mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR blend long-run and recent data. These choices keep orders responsive while controlling holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has fallen sharply since late June/early July: Periods 21\u201326 demands = [79,55,35,23,17,27], avg=39.33 over 6 periods. No late or lost shipments observed historically (all concluded lead_times=0). To avoid overstocking given current on-hand=204 and low recent demand, keep lead time at promised (default) but base demand forecast and volatility on the recent low regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the 6-period low-demand regime) so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and caps orders appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg decreased from 206.9 (Periods 1\u201320) to 39.33 (Periods 21\u201326), \u221281.0% sustained over 6 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed since Period 21 (demands: 79,55,35,23,17,27,28 \u2192 avg \u224839.33). On-hand=176, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty and no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has consistently observed =0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 21\u201327, length=7), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures current mean and volatility over the low-demand regime). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the lower demand environment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=158, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), and demand has shifted down since Period 21 (already recorded). With adequate on-hand stock and no evidence of new regime change, use promised/default lead time and population-wide demand/variance estimates so the OR engine leverages full history. This balances service (use long-run mean) while avoiding aggressive extra safety stock given current high on-hand and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has settled at a much lower regime since Period 21 (weekly demand ~17\u201335); on-hand=200, in-transit=0, so inventory is high relative to current weekly demand. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (arrivals observed same period), so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To avoid excess holding cost I forecast using the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (Periods 21\u201329). Regime length=9 periods, so choose recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower mean and volatility and reduce ordering.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21: avg demand Periods 21\u201330 = 31.9 units/week (vs prior baseline ~200+). On-hand=187, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage for the current low demand but holding cost=$1/unit/period argues against large replenishment. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised 0. For demand forecast, target the recent low regime using recent_N on the last 10 periods (captures the post-changepoint demand mean=31.9); set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the new low-demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=176, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample vs. current low demand. All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so use default promised lead time. For forecasting, use recent_N over the low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering: set mu_hat based on last 11 observed weekly demands (Periods 21\u201331). Likewise use sigma_hat recent_N with N=11 to capture current low-volatility regime. This keeps target base-stock low and reduces holding cost while preserving service given the confirmed lower-demand regime.

To avoid overstocking given the sustained low-demand regime (changepoint at Period 21, regime length = 14 periods), I forecast demand using recent_N with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base-stock tailored to the low regime and reduces excess holding cost while preserving service.

Historical concluded lead times = 0 periods (orders always arrived same period). I set L=default to use promised lead time 0. To capture the sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (Periods 21\u201335) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the low-demand regime rather than older high-season samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a lower summer/fall regime since Period 21 (sustained ~10-30 units/week) while on-hand is healthy (129) and in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time changes (all concluded lead_times = 0). To avoid overstock while meeting low recent demand, use recent demand statistics from the low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201336, regime length=16). Keep L as default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility and therefore lower base-stock target and cap.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand=119, in-transit=0; demand has been in the lower regime since Period 21 (sustained drop). No evidence of lead-time deviations (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Use promised lead time to keep OR backend assumptions simple. For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent consistent regime (Periods 21\u201337, regime length=17). This keeps orders aligned to lower demand (reducing holding cost) while preserving service via OR's service-level cap.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop confirmed in prior carry-over). On-hand=114, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times are 0 consistently. I therefore use promised/default lead time. To focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, taking N=18 (Periods 21\u201338 inclusive is an 18-period low-demand regime). This anchors (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to the recent low-demand behavior, reducing excess safety stock while maintaining service given low variability observed recently.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=108, in-transit=0. History shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (carry-over noted: avg \u224839.33 over P21\u2013P26 and low single-digit/teens thereafter). Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. To align orders with the sustained low-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent data from the low regime: use recent_N over the most recent 19 concluded demand samples (Periods 21\u201339) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock close to current low-demand run-rate and avoids excess inventory given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces influence of the earlier high-demand periods and helps OR backend size orders to meet (L+1)-period demand under the new regime while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand ~5\u201313) and on-hand is 99 with 0 in-transit. Historical lead times have consistently been 0. To avoid overstocking and reflect the sustained low-demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period-21 low-demand regime (use the last 20 samples), so the OR backend will forecast lower (1+L)-period demand and reduce target base stock and cap accordingly, balancing service and holding cost given high holding relative to profit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Observed sustained low-demand regime since Period 21: weekly demand fell from ~207 to single-digits/teens (Periods 21\u201341). All concluded lead times = 0 (orders historically arrived same period). On-hand = 91, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0 since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most recent 20 samples (Periods 22\u201341) because a clear, sustained regime shift occurred at Period 21; N=20 captures the stable low-demand regime while respecting the N selection rule. This reduces forecasted mu_hat and sigma_hat vs. using all samples, lowering orders to avoid heavy holding cost while maintaining service for the new low demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Demand has remained in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop documented in carry-over). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L to let OR assume promised lead time. To align forecasts with the sustained low-demand regime, use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples (captures periods 23\u201342 roughly). This reduces overstock risk vs. using long-run mean while preserving service. No evidence of new lead-time or demand regime shifts beyond those already recorded.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (weekly demands ~4\u201328, recent 20-period mean=12.7). On-hand=83, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample vs. low demand so avoid large replenishment. Use promised lead time (default, actual historically 0). For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 20 periods (Period 24\u201343) to capture the sustained low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248 12.7. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent volatility (std \u2248 7.41). These parameters steer OR toward much smaller replenishment (matching low current demand) and reduce holding cost risk given high on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained low-demand regime beginning at Period 21 (many periods with single- or low-digit weekly demand vs. earlier high seasonal levels). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments; observed lead times in concludes are 0. To avoid overstocking given holding cost >0 and clearly lower recent demand, set L to default (promised = 0). Forecast demand using the most recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the last ~20 periods of sustained low demand) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent consumption and reduces excess inventory while preserving service.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand mostly 2\u201328, many weeks 4\u201312). On-hand=77, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected (no overdue shipments). I retain promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments in the recent low-demand regime. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 26\u201345 included) so mu_hat reflects the current low mean over the last 20 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to estimate volatility from the same regime. This keeps base stock small to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the low, stable demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Demand has been in the low post-July regime since Period 21 (sustained low weekly sales ~1\u201328 units); on-hand=76 and in-transit=0, giving large cover vs recent demand. Promised lead time remains 0 and historical concluded arrivals indicate lead_time=0, so use default for L. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 20 periods (captures the post-change regime while smoothing short noise). This reduces forecasted replenishment and holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand environment.
