Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals. Historical weekly samples show low demand (~10-11) for 3 weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28) then a one-week spike 2019-02-04 = 74. I do not have 3+ consecutive periods confirming a new higher regime, but the most recent window includes the spike so I hedge moderately. Set L to promised (default). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 samples: 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) so mu_hat reflects the recent uptick while avoiding overreacting to a single outlier. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (cover possible spike) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly samples show low baseline (11,11,10,11,74 -> mean ~23.4) but Period 1 had a one-off large demand (98) and an arrived order confirming lead_time=0 for that order. No sustained regime change detected (single high demand point). Use calculated lead time (observed average = 0) and default demand/volatility estimates to avoid overreacting to one spike; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly series showed low demand (~11 units) through Jan, then a sustained surge starting 2019-02-04 (74) and continuing with high observed demand in Period 1 (98) and Period 2 (107). Observed concluded lead times for orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 were 0 periods (arrived same period); average observed lead time = 0. To capture the new high-demand regime while remaining robust, set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=3 (samples: 2019-02-04:74, Period1:98, Period2:107) so the forecast reflects the new higher mean and variance rather than the prior low-demand regime. This increases base-stock to meet elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent data mitigates stockouts given zero lead time and zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-02-04 to 2019-02-18: recent avg = 93.0 (samples: 74,98,107) vs prior avg \u2248 10.75 (Jan samples), increase \u2248 +764%; confirmed 3 consecutive high periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent data show a sustained high-demand regime beginning 2019-02-04: recent demands = 74,98,107,81 (4 periods) vs prior \u224810.8. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and observed lead_time=0 in concluded periods. To capture the new higher-demand regime use recent 4-period demand estimates so the OR engine raises base-stock; keep lead time as default (promised=0). This balances service (avoid stockouts given surge) against holding cost by using recent demand mean/volatility rather than long-run low baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20134) shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed arrived same period) so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime from 2019-02-04 with 3 high samples (74,98,107); use those 3 most recent high-demand weeks to set forecast and volatility. Profit and holding cost are equal, so service/holding tradeoff is balanced\u2014using recent regime-based mean/variance captures elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory beyond the confirmed spike.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times = 0 in all past arrivals (Periods 1\u20135), so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand regime (since 2019-02-04) is elevated; use recent_N on last 5 demand samples (98,107,81,67,44) to capture current higher mean/volatility and set mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly so the OR backend targets service for this sustained high-demand regime while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since 2019-02-04 (recent weekly demands: 98,107,81,67,44,55; recent mean \u224875.3). Current on-hand=25, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is well below one-week expected demand. All historical concludes (P1\u2013P6) show orders arriving the same period. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed high-demand regime (captures the last 6 samples). Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base stock sized to the new higher-demand regime while using observed lead time and recent volatility to balance service vs holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P6 arrived same period in concludes).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs Jan; actual lead time repeatedly observed as 0 in concludes. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. I set L=default (promised 0) because lead time confirmed 0 in concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the recent high-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward serving the elevated recent demand while avoiding overstock given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained higher weekly demand across 8 periods). I set L to default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-2019-02-04 high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep the OR backend focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime and the confirmed zero lead time, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I set L to default (promised 0, consistent with observed). For demand I use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (9 most recent samples from 2019-02-04 through 2019-04-08) so mu_hat reflects elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N to capture recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods. Recent demand has declined from the early high-regime; last 5 demands (Periods 6-10) = [55,44,65,32,24], so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current lower mean and variability. L set by observed average lead times to keep the OR engine aware of confirmed 0-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent regime and reduce overstating demand/variance, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has stabilized after the Feb spike: last 6 demands = [55,44,65,32,24,24], recent mean \u224840.7. On-hand=20, in-transit=0, lead time historically confirmed 0. To balance profit=holding (q=0.5) we use a short-horizon recent estimate to reflect the post-spike decline and avoid excess holding. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current regime mean (1+L)*mean \u224840.7. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture recent volatility for service-level sizing. This keeps orders responsive to the observed post-spike demand reduction and limits holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has settled lower after the Feb spike: last 6 observed demands = [44,65,32,24,24,22], recent mean \u2248 35.17. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture the latest low-demand regime and avoid overstock from the earlier spike. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters make the OR engine target a base-stock aligned with current demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service under the current low-demand regime and confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (consistent arrivals). Demand showed a large regime jump in Feb (74,98,107) but has trended downward to mid-20s in recent weeks. I use L=default (promised 0) to reflect observed 0 lead time and avoid inflating pipeline. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand samples: 65,32,24,24,22,22 \u2192 mean=31.5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean, capturing the more recent lower-demand regime while still covering short variability. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility rather than the historical spike, enabling the OR backend to size safety stock appropriately given current variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 0-period lead time; no overdue shipments. Recent demand shows a lower regime since early April (periods 9\u201314: 32,24,24,22,22,40) vs earlier high spike in Feb. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower-demand regime (six most recent samples) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet the current run-rate and avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding. This balances service level against holding cost under confirmed short lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently and a sustained demand regime shift upward since 2019-02-04 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover same-period demand. I set L to be calculated from observed leads (will confirm 0). For demand I use recent_N to focus the OR forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 12 samples to capture recent weeks while smoothing older low-Jan values). Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while avoiding excess inventory given profit=holding (service quantile=0.5).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04; recent demand since that changepoint spans Periods 3\u201316 (14 samples) with higher and variable demand versus Jan. No overdue shipments. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will produce 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the post-changepoint regime ((1+L)*mean over the last 14 samples), and sigma_hat recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. This focuses the base-stock on the confirmed higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent on-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 (all observed arrivals same-period). Demand exhibits earlier spike in Feb (recorded carry-over) but the most recent 6 demand samples (Periods 12\u201317 = 22,22,22,40,25,9,15) indicate a lower, mixed regime with recent avg \u2248 22 units/week. To keep safety lean given profit=holding ($1/$1) and confirmed L=0, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) so mu_hat reflects the current lower-demand regime and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. L set to calculate to lock in observed lead time=0. These choices reduce excess holding while preserving service for the current demand level.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=13, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible in conclude (no overdue shipments). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 -> use promised lead time. Demand history shows an early Feb spike (registered carry-over) but subsequent weeks settled to moderate weekly demand; to capture recent demand behavior I use a recent-window for demand moments. Set L to promised (default=0) so mu/sigma scale is (1+0). Use recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most recent 12 demand samples, balancing responsiveness to recent declines after the Feb spike while smoothing week-to-week noise. This raises service level when needed but avoids excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Historical concludes (P1\u2013P19) show consistent same-period arrivals => confirmed short lead time behavior and no missing shipments in recent history. Demand spiked in early Feb (confirmed carry-over) but since Apr/May weekly demand settled lower (~9\u201340, recent weeks ~12\u201325). To avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) prioritize recent demand: set L via observed lead times, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures lower mean/volatility and limits over-ordering).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (Periods 1\u201320). Demand spiked in Feb (confirmed earlier carry-over) and since March has reverted to a lower, more stable regime. Recent demand (Periods 16\u201320: 9,15,12,12,9) suggests using a short recent window to capture current mean/volatility. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent stable samples, which helps the OR backend target service while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Recent demand (Periods 14\u201321) has been lower and more stable than the Feb spike; to capture the current regime I use recent_N over the last 8 samples to set demand forecast and volatility. L uses default (promised 0) so OR backend treats review+lead horizon as current period.

To avoid excess holding cost versus small profit (profit=holding), I use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime using the last 10 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets appropriate base-stock for current low-demand environment.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent observed lead times are consistently 0 (concluded arrivals P1\u2013P24 show lead_time=0). Recent demand has moved from the Feb spike back to low summer demand (last 8 demand samples: periods 17\u201324 = 15,12,0,12,4,9,8,4 \u2192 mean \u2248 8.0). On-hand=9, in-transit=0, profit=holding so service target q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 base_stock should track expected demand over review+lead. I set L using observed lead times, and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand summer regime while being responsive to recent variation. This keeps base_stock \u2248 (1+L)*recent mean to avoid excess holding while meeting typical demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a past demand regime jump in Feb; since then demand has settled at much lower weekly levels. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost, I use a lead-time estimate from observed concludes and base demand on the most recent stable regime (last 12 weeks) so the OR engine sizes orders to meet near-term demand without excess holdings.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201326 concludes). Recent demand has settled lower after the Feb spike; to capture current regime I use recent data. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent six weekly demands, limiting influence of the large Feb spike while keeping enough samples for stability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent 30-unit week) against holding cost (profit=holding so target z*=0).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (all observed arrivals same period). Recent demand shows a short, sharp uptick in the last 3 concluded periods (Period 25-27 demands: 18, 30, 64) while earlier periods were much lower; this likely represents a recent regime increase or volatility. To capture the most-recent demand level and variability I set L using calculate (average observed lead times = 0), and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets safety/stock for the current elevated demand pattern while keeping holding costs limited.

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile over the last several weeks (demands: 4,4,5,18,30,64,62); use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current higher mean and variability, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by concentrating on recent demand regime rather than long-run low-Jan means.

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile in late Aug (Period 25\u201329 demands: 18,30,64,62,67). To capture the current high-demand regime and short-term volatility, I set L=default (promised=0), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on last 5 demand samples), and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variability. This biases the base-stock toward recent demand spikes while keeping holding risk aligned to current volatility.

Recent demand has shifted higher in the last 5 periods (Periods 26\u201330 demands = 30,64,62,67,131); I treat that as the active regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to honor confirmed 0 LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend targets service for the recent spike pattern while avoiding reliance on older low-demand Jan samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. Recent demand has jumped sharply over the last 6 periods (P26\u2013P31: demands 30,64,62,67,131,164); on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the new higher regime. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concludes; use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 6 samples (captures the new high-demand regime). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet much higher current demand while recognizing higher sigma for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26\u201331 (2019-08-05 to 2019-09-09): recent avg = 86.33 (samples: 30,64,62,67,131,164) vs prior avg \u2248 9.0 (Periods 18\u201325), increase \u2248 +860%; sustained 6 periods.

Period 33 (2019-09-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders P1\u2013P32 all arrived same period) so set L by calculating observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime from Period 26 onward (sustained high weekly demands: 30,64,62,67,131,164,131); use recent_N (N=7) to capture this regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets an elevated base-stock while reflecting current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current spikes) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the confirmed high-demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since 2019-08-05 (Periods 26\u201333) with large spikes (most recent demand 293 on P33). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To adapt to the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates capturing the last 8 periods (Periods 26\u201333) which reflect the elevated mean and volatility. L uses the default promised lead time (0) since concluded messages confirm 0 lead time historically. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon based on recent demand while the recent_N sigma captures current volatility so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost for the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since 2019-08-05 (Periods 26\u201334) \u2014 recent elevated weekly demands (30,64,62,67,131,164,131,293,96). I set L via calculate to capture observed lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (the 9-week recent high-demand regime, (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std will be computed by backend). This provides a forecast that reflects the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumptions accurate, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand has exhibited a sustained high regime since 2019-08-05 (Periods 26\u201336); I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the elevated average and volatility from that regime while avoiding dilution by low-Jan baseline. Setting L=default (promised 0) preserves fast replenishment assumption. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 (regime length \u2248 11 weeks, N chosen per changepoint rules) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using the elevated mean and observed variability\u2014this increases service for high demand periods while the backend's cap limits excessive orders to control holding cost.

Demand remains in the elevated post-August regime (recent demands: 131,293,96,60,40,63). I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6 samples) so the OR backend stocks to recent elevated demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 34-38 demands = 96,60,40,63,110); using recent window to capture current regime. Set L to promised (default = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest elevated/volatile demand and reduce stockout risk while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders P1\u2013P39 concluded same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (2019-08-05) \u2014 recent high-volume periods from P26\u2013P39 show substantially elevated demand versus Jan baseline. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate based on the current high-demand regime (last 14 concluded demand samples, P26\u2013P39) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high regime; sigma_hat uses the recent_N std to capture current volatility. This preserves service during the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding inflated safety stock from old low-demand periods. No overdue shipments detected.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in many concluded periods (sustained). Demand recently pulled down from extreme outlier (P33=293) to a post-spike regime: last 6 demand samples (P35\u2013P40) = [60,40,63,110,76,72], recent average \u224870 units. No new sustained upward or downward shift for 3+ periods beyond this recent window. Use promised lead time (default=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to center forecasts on the current post-spike demand level and capture recent volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (multiple confirmed spikes: several weeks with demand >> prior baseline). On-hand=26, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To align the OR base-stock (which equals m\xfb when profit=holding) with current elevated demand, I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current regime while keeping L at promised (default=0). I choose N=8 to cover the most recent two months of weeks (captures recent demand variability without over-weighting a single spike). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current higher demand while the OR cap will limit excessive orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Periods 37\u201342 demands = 63,110,76,72,45,148; recent mean \u224885.7) consistent with late-year/holiday uplift vs earlier low-demand regimes. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concludes; keep promised lead time. To balance service and holding cost during this high, variable demand period I use a recent-window forecast so base-stock reflects the current elevated mean and volatility (reducing stockouts) while avoiding inflating estimates from older low-demand history.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 periods. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (recent 6 demands: P38\u2013P43), so I use an L estimated from observed lead times and recent-demand estimates to capture current regime while keeping safety stock moderate. Choices: L=set by observed average lead time (calculate=0); mu_hat uses the mean of the most recent 6 demand samples to reflect the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the std of the most recent 6 samples to capture recent volatility. These params steer the OR backend to hold stock for current high/volatile demand but avoid overstating demand from older low-demand periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201344) = [76,72,45,148,26,26] shows high variance and a mixed recent pattern; to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost, I bias toward recent demand to avoid stockouts from intermittent spikes while limiting extra holding. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since observed lead time has been consistently 0. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime including the large spike (Period 42) while smoothing with nearby weeks. This provides the OR engine a short-term responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock responds to recent elevated demand but does not overcommit to long-term high averages.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals => lead time confirmed 0. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201345 = 72,45,148,26,26,26) mixes a large Nov spike with low Dec weeks; to balance service vs holding (profit=holding => q=0.5, z*=0) I forecast demand using a short recent window to capture current regime including the Nov spike but remain responsive to low recent weeks. Methods chosen: L by calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0); mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to set base-stock to (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples; sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility for the OR cap calculation. This keeps orders responsive to recent variability while avoiding excessive inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 each concluded period (consistent same\u2010day arrivals). Recent demand has been mixed with a large spike at Period 42 (148) then lower weeks (26,26,26,12). To keep responsiveness while reflecting short recent regime including the spike, set lead time by calculation from observed lead times (0). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 6 demand samples (includes the spike) so the OR backend raises base stock modestly for the observed volatility while avoiding overcommitting to older low-demand periods. This balances service (capture recent spikes) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.
