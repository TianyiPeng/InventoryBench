Product: womens sweater/wrap top \u2014 plausible modest seasonal/holiday uplift but spike may be an outlier. Demand regime: recent baseline (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28) averages ~10.75 units/week; single high point on 2019-02-04 is insufficient to confirm a sustained shift. Lead time / pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual may differ; no concluded arrivals to infer anything. Inventory logic: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1/period, so excess ending inventory is very costly; aim to match expected near-term demand with minimal safety stock. Order decision: target the established baseline weekly demand (~11 units) to meet likely demand while avoiding high holding penalties. ",
