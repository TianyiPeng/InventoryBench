Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable mid-100s to 170s demand (mean ~157 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so cannot infer any lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and use full-sample demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all available data; this balances service (cover ~1 period of demand) against holding cost given modest holding cost relative to profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). SKU 573085004 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History: Period1 order of 193 arrived in Period1 (arrived=193, ordered on Period1 \u2192 observed lead time = 0). Recent demand in Period1 was 203, while historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 157.2 and moderate dispersion. No sustained demand regime change detected (only one high demand period), and lead time evidence supports promised lead time = 0. To avoid overreacting to a single high week, use default demand estimates: L kept as promised (default), mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (captures historical average) against holding cost while acknowledging confirmed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order placed on Period1 and arrived in Period1: ordered=193, arrived=193).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (Period1 & Period2 orders arrived same period). Demand history mean across samples = 157.2 units/week, std \u2248 19.01. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for next period's demand. Use default lead time (promised=0, confirmed by arrivals). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects historical average demand while the confirmed zero lead time keeps pipeline short to limit holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded demands (P1-P3: 203, 283, 235) are markedly above the historical sample mean (2019 Jan-Feb mean=157.2). Lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded arrivals. To react to a sustained upward demand regime (3 consecutive high-demand periods) I set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $19 vs holding $1 yields high service-level target).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 1-3 concluded): recent avg demand = 240.33 vs historical avg = 157.20 (+53%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4253.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent evidence (Periods 1-4 conclude) confirms actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift: recent 3-period avg demand = 240.33 vs historical avg 157.20 (+53%). On-hand=79, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=3 equals detected regime length). This raises the base-stock and safety stock to prioritize service (profit >> holding cost) while keeping holding risk limited by using only the short recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3862.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=90, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1-P5): [203,283,235,228,208]; recent demand elevated vs older historical mean. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded messages. To prioritize service with minimal holding cost (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), I keep lead time inferred from observations and size forecast to recent demand: L determined from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent 5 periods to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing variability. This raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts given zero actual lead time and no in-transit units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-6) is well above historical 2019-Jan baseline (recent avg \u2248225 vs hist avg 157), and lead time has been consistently observed as 0. On-hand=91, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments. To reflect the confirmed higher demand regime and preserve service while controlling holding cost, set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0), use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat using the last 6 demand samples (captures the sustained elevated demand), and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect current volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet (1+L)-period demand while keeping variability estimates aligned to recent data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demand has moderated after an elevated spike; last 3 concluded demands = [208,193,137], so I use a recent 3-week estimate to capture the most current regime while keeping responsiveness. L kept as default (promised 0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the base-stock responsive to the downward shift versus the earlier spike, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down from the early spike (P1-P5) to lower values in P6-P8; inventory is healthy vs current demand. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times are 0, so use calculated lead time. To capture the recent downward demand regime while retaining some smoothing, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples to forecast (1+L) period demand and volatility). This reduces over-ordering versus using the full-period high historical mean while giving moderate safety stock for service level (q\u22480.95) and keeping holding cost exposure reasonable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/4/15 decision. On-hand=205, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use calculate to confirm L=0. Recent demand has declined since the earlier (+53%) regime: last 5 concluded demands (P5-P9 = 208,193,137,106,54) show a lower recent mean (139.6) and elevated variability. To avoid excess holding while maintaining high service (profit $19 vs hold $1 \u2192 high target quantile), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime and limits over-ordering given zero lead time and substantial on-hand stock.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use recent demand statistics (last 5 weeks) with promised lead time. This makes mu_hat responsive to the recent downward demand trend and sigma_hat reflect recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Use promised lead time (confirmed repeatedly as 0) so L=default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make (1+L)\xd7mean reflect the recent low demand and avoid excess holding. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent lower variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (carry-over insight) and on-hand=126, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 concluded samples (Periods 8-12) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility rather than the higher historical mean, reducing overstock risk while preserving service. L uses the promised/confirmed lead time=0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent confirmed demand regime is low (Periods 7-13: sustained drop). On-hand=104, in-transit=0 \u2014 ~2.4 weeks cover at recent demand. All concluded arrivals show lead time=0 historically, so use promised lead time. I set L=default to keep lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (periods 9-13 demands = 54,60,44,35,22; mean=43). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility (sample std \u224815.13). These parameters bias orders toward the new low-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service level.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped markedly (Periods 12-14 demands = 35,22,19). Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history consistently shows LT=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new low-demand regime (use last 3 periods to forecast (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility). This tightens stocking to avoid holding costs while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (sustained; recent demands: Periods 7-15 show low values). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default=0) and ground demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 9 concluded periods (Periods 7-15) to reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility and keep orders conservative.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 7 (especially Periods 12-16 with demands 35,22,19,19,13). Pipeline is empty so on-hand must cover (1+L) periods. I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 7-16) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering versus using the full historical mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce base-stock and cap, lowering ordering to preserve profit while minimizing holding cost given low recent demand and no in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 7; latest 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 13-17) = [22,19,19,13,13], mean \u224817.2 units/week. On-hand=106, in-transit=0 so current cover is ample vs one-week demand but I must avoid excess holding cost. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained low-demand regime and reduce forecast bias from earlier high-demand weeks. This tightens the base-stock recommendation to favor lower ordering (improves profit net of holding).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand has collapsed vs historical: Periods 12-18 demands = [35,22,19,19,13,13,6], sustained low-volume for 7 periods. Lead times historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals were same-period). To reflect the new low-demand regime I set L to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility using the last 7 demand samples; this tightens the base-stock to avoid excess holding given high holding exposure relative to current demand while retaining a high service quantile implied by profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg demand over Periods 12-18 = 18.14 vs historical avg 157.20 (\u221288%), sustained for 7 periods

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been persistently low since Period 12 (many periods with single- or low-double-digit sales). On-hand=88, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0. I therefore set lead time to be inferred from observations, and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (to avoid overstock). Using recent_N=7 captures the sustained low-demand period (Periods 12\u201318/19) so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock and reduces holding cost exposure.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To avoid overstocking given holding cost and reduced demand, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=9 for demand moments to capture the low-demand regime (regime length=9). This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat versus historical averages and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Observed sustained low-demand regime since Period 12 (recent 5 demands: 13,6,12,3,5; mean=7.8) and confirmed actual lead time=0 in historical concludes. On-hand=80, in-transit=0 \u2014 current inventory already covers many periods at this low demand, so order targets should reflect the low recent demand to avoid holding cost. I set L to default (promised lead time 0, confirmed by arrivals). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (capturing current mean and volatility) so the OR backend will compute a low base-stock and cap, reducing excessive replenishment and holding costs while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 12 with very low weekly sales last 11 periods (avg \u224813.5). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. To reflect the confirmed short lead time and recent demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the last 11 demand samples to capture the new low-demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) to reflect realized volatility in that same recent regime. This reduces target base stock and limits holding costs given low demand and confirmed prompt arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after a large demand spike in Period 23 (sold out). Historical concluded lead times remain 0 when arrivals occurred. Recent demand shows a low baseline with a single large spike in Period 23; to balance service vs holding cost I use a short-run recent forecast to capture the spike risk while limiting inventory. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the last 5 concluded demands (P19-P23 = 12,3,5,2,109) so the OR backend scales (1+L)\xd7mean of those. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility including the spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical data shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent across concluded periods). Demand has been very low for many periods but recent 2 weeks saw a sharp spike (Period 23 demand=109, Period 24 demand=73) that is NOT yet sustained for 3+ periods. To be responsive to the recent spike while still reflecting very recent demand pattern, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 demand observations (captures the recent jump without overreacting to a single-week blip). Sigma is also estimated from the same recent 5 samples to reflect increased volatility. L uses the default (promised) lead time = 0, matching observed concludes.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculated lead time. On-hand=32, in-transit=0 and recent demand (Periods 23-25 = 109,73,89) shows a clear uptick vs earlier low regime; I target the short recent regime to avoid stockouts given current sales spike. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the 109/73/89 spike -> (1+L)\xd7mean over last 3). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward higher service (reducing lost sales) while keeping holding cost reasonable given limited on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand very volatile with a large spike in Period 26 (204) after several low/moderate weeks; short lead time historically confirmed as 0. To react quickly to recent regime while limiting holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the recent spike and surrounding weeks). This raises ordering responsiveness to current demand without over-weighting long-past high historical means.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed have arrived same period). Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 23 (demands P23-P27 = 109,73,89,204,440); I treat this as the current regime and base forecasts on the last 5 periods to capture the recent spike and volatility. Therefore: L=default (use promised lead time=0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)*mean over last 5 demands. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service level (respond to recent high/volatile demand) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than long-run average.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent periods 24-28 demand = [73,89,204,440,414], recent mean=244 (5 periods) showing a sustained spike vs historical mean 157. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (regime length=5). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to cover the current high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind because L=0 avoids inflating (1+L) factor.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=203, in-transit=0. Recent periods (P26\u2013P29) show a strong demand spike (204,440,414,329) and earlier carry-over noted a spike around P24\u2013P28. Promised lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0; use default promised L to keep timing consistent. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set demand estimate using recent_N with N=5 to weight the last 5 observed demands; use the same recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) tolerates additional inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Recent demand has spiked sharply since Period 24 with very high and volatile weekly sales in Periods 26\u201330 (demands: 204, 440, 414, 329, 457). Promised and observed lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in concluded history). On-hand=81, in-transit=0 so we must plan for elevated near-term demand. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 5 weeks' mean scaled by (1+L)). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the higher volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while letting the backend cap limit extreme orders.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To prioritize service while limiting holding cost given high recent demand, I use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 3-week regime to capture the current high-demand level and its volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=339, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 28-32) show a sustained high-demand regime (demands: 414,329,457,306,159; 5-week avg\u2248333) versus longer-run historical avg\u2248157. Promised lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0, so I keep L=default (0). To capture the recent high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while profit>>holding cost, I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses the 5-week mean). Volatility is set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This raises the base-stock appropriately while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap parameter.

On-hand = 239, in-transit = 0, and historical conclues consistently confirm lead time = 0. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (L=default) and forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current high-demand regime; estimate variability from the same 5-week window so the OR backend sets a base-stock appropriate for the recent spike while capping orders via its cap formula.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has rebounded from prior low regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [457, 306, 159, 284, 126], recent mean ~266.4 which is well above long-run historical mean. On-hand=357, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand but we must set forecast to reflect the recent higher-demand regime to avoid stockouts. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (capture the most recent regime while keeping sample size \u22653). This biases the OR backend toward higher base-stock to protect service during the current elevated-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed (no missing arrivals).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand (Periods 32-36) averaged ~148.6 units/week, close to long-run mean; all concluded lead-times observed = 0. On-hand is high (310) and in-transit = 0, so avoid aggressive replenishment. I set L to observed-average lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (last 5 weeks) and limit responsiveness to older, large spikes. These parameters reduce unnecessary orders given high on-hand while keeping service given short lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=230, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show lead time consistently 0; recent demand (last ~5 concluded periods) is low (~79\u201395) vs earlier spikes. To avoid heavy holding cost while meeting near-term demand, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current lower regime. sigma_hat uses recent 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce target base-stock and cap orders, lowering holding cost while preserving service for current demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand 209, in-transit 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34-38) = [126,95,79,80,67], recent mean \u2248 89.4; I choose recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the base-stock on current lower-demand regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases service for short lead (L=0) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Volatility also appears reduced, so use recent_N for sigma_hat with same window.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 each period \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been well below long-run averages (last 5 concluded demands: 79,80,67,66,26 \u2192 recent mean \u224863.6), so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. sigma_hat also estimated from the same recent window to reflect lower recent volatility. These choices lower the base-stock target and cap expected orders, trading some service for much lower holding cost given current low demand and ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply over the past 6 weeks (Periods 36-41: 79,80,67,66,26,19) indicating a sustained low-demand regime versus earlier spikes. Promised lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0; use default L. To react quickly to the recent low-demand regime and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat using a recent_N average (last 5 periods) to capture the current lower mean demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent reduced volatility. These parameters lower the base-stock target, reducing expected ending inventory while preserving service for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; no evidence of lost shipments\u2014use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 36-42) is lower and more variable than early-year peaks; to adapt to the current lower regime while capturing recent volatility, I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 7 periods. This reduces target base-stock vs full-history mean to limit holding cost while preserving service for short-term demand. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect observed variability.

Recent demand has been lower and variable; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43) = [66,26,19,83,35], avg \u224845.8. To balance profit vs holding cost with current low pipeline and holiday-week variability, set L=default (promised 0), forecast demand using recent 5 weeks for mu_hat, and estimate volatility from the same 5-week window for sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the most recent regime while avoiding overstock given holding cost=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmations), so use promised/default L. Recent demand has been much lower than earlier high-season spikes; last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 40-44) = [26,19,83,35,32], recent mean \u224839. To reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock while maintaining service, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covers most recent behavior). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent variability. This keeps inventory responsive to the current regime and balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean \u2248157 (Jan samples) but recent weeks show a sustained low-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 41-45) = [19,83,35,32,15], avg=36.8. Lead times have consistently concluded as 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overordering / holding cost while maintaining service. This balances profit (high relative to holding cost) against current low demand by lowering the base-stock forecast and reducing inventory risk.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times overwhelmingly 0 periods\u2014use default promised L=0. Recent sales (Periods 43-46 = 35,32,15,13) are well below long-run historical average, so bias forecast toward the recent regime to avoid further holding cost. Choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent demand regime while the OR engine computes base stock; this reduces over-ordering given zero pipeline and modest holding cost relative to profit (profit $19, holding $1 => high target service level but we still prefer responsiveness to recent low demand).
