With L=0 we only need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand before next decision. I target a short-term on-hand target around ~200 units to cover likely single-period demand spikes while limiting holding cost. Current on-hand 129 -> order 80 to reach on-hand+arrival \u2248209. This is a conservative reduction from OR's 195 order (OR would push inventory higher) that still provides safety for high recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost given volatility. No in-transit shipments to reconcile and no signs of lost orders. Final action: order 80 units for SKU 706016015.",
