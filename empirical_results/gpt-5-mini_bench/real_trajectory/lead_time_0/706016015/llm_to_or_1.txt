Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~352 units/week with SD ~92. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0. No concluded arrivals/history of delayed or lost shipments to infer a different lead time. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates (use all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost with no evidence of a regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand: Period 1 sold=227. Historical weekly samples (5): [484,413,366,244,255]. On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Period 1 order (440) arrived in Period 1 (conclude shows arrived=440, ordered on Period 1, lead_time=0) \u2014 evidence actual lead time = 0. Promised lead time = 0; no late/lost shipments observed. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed by evidence). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable forecast anchored to available history while the confirmed lead time=0 keeps review+lead horizon short and limits holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order: ordered P1, arrived P1)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=229, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived same period (lead time=0 confirmed). No demand regime shift detected from provided samples. To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and historical demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (using confirmed short lead time) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Observed lead times: all concluded arrivals from P1-P3 show lead_time=0 (confirmed). Recent demand shows a downward trend vs older historical samples: last three realized demands = 227, 192, 167. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L by calculating observed lead time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 3 periods) to capture the recent lower mean and reduced variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows on-hand=96, in-transit=0 and four weeks of declining sales (227,192,167,141). Lead time was confirmed as 0 in prior periods (orders arrived same period). I choose L=default to use the promised 0 lead time. Demand forecast uses historical sample set provided (mean=352.4 over five weeks) so mu_hat=default (1+L times mean of all samples). Volatility uses all samples so sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L) times std of all samples \u2248102.7). Using defaults keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to the full-sample demand while avoiding overfitting to the recent decline; this balances service level (profit/hc ratio) against holding cost given current on-hand=96 and no pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized weekly demand has settled well below the older 2019 samples (P1-P5 demands: 227,192,167,141,152 \u2192 recent mean \u2248176). On-hand=224, in-transit=0 and confirmed lead time=0 from earlier concludes, so no pipeline expected. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (uses last 5 observed demands) so the OR base-stock reflects current weekly demand level. For volatility I also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings reduce excess holding while maintaining service against current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=123, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019 Jan) show mean ~352, but recent fulfilled demand (Periods 1-6) shows a clear downward regime: last 6 periods demand = [227,192,167,141,152,101], mean=163.3. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To avoid overstock given sustained lower demand while maintaining high service (profit=4, holding=1 \u2192 q high), set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand regime, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align base-stock to recent demand and mitigate holding costs while preserving service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent Periods 1-6 avg demand=163 (vs historical sample mean=352), sustained over 6 periods (~-54%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand has shifted down and remained low for ~6 periods (P2\u2013P7 avg \u2248163). Current on-hand=76, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times are 0, so set L via calculate to lock that. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (keeps base-stock aligned to reduced demand and avoids excess holding while preserving service given $4 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent observed demand is well below historical sample mean (recent 6-period avg \u2248163 vs historical 352), and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover. I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples). For uncertainty I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to historical averages, lowering overstocks while keeping service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand has downshifted vs historical samples (recent 6 demands = [141,152,101,124,141,88], mean=124.5). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, use promised/default lead time=0 and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 6 weeks (recent_N, N=6). This keeps base-stock aligned to the lower recent regime and caps orders accordingly.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 6 (recent 6-period avg ~163 vs historical sample mean ~352). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm same. To avoid overstock while preserving service, I use the confirmed promised lead time and base forecasts on the recent 6-period regime (N=6) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes orders to the lower recent demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: recent Periods 1-6 avg demand=163 vs historical sample mean=352 (\u2248-54%), sustained over 6 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=92, in-transit=0; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical samples show a sustained downward demand regime versus earlier baseline; most recent 6 concluded demands (Periods 6\u201311 = 101,124,141,88,62,48) average ~94, well below earlier averages. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sets a much lower base stock; L left at default (promised 0, confirmed by history). This reduces expected overstock/holding cost while preserving service level for current lower demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime detected earlier (Periods 1-6 avg \u2248163 vs historical sample mean 352, sustained ~6 periods). On-hand=60, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this period. Promised lead time=0 and concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of last 6 demands). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce targets and ordering cap to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given the confirmed low-demand regime and zero lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=352 but recent regime (Periods 7-12) shows sustained low demand (avg \u224863 over 6 periods, ~-82% vs historical), so I bias forecasts to recent behavior. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility; this reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current low demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (sustained depressed demand vs historical samples). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 7\u201315) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility, reducing overstock risk while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given low on-hand and empty pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (sustained ~6\u201310 periods). On-hand=71, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent data for demand estimates so the OR engine reduces target stock while keeping service. L uses promised (and confirmed) 0. mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 (regime length from Period 7\u201316 =10) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 10 samples, balancing lower demand signal against holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent demand has been well below historical sample mean and shows a sustained low regime since ~Period 7 (weekly demands mostly 22\u201369 in latest weeks). On-hand=81, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers several weeks of current low demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime and minimize holding cost while meeting service, I set L by averaging observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (last 11 periods) to capture the current lower mean and volatility rather than the historical high winter samples. This lowers the base_stock target and reduces excess inventory risk while allowing the OR backend cap to limit order size.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 7 (weekly demand mostly 22\u2013141, markedly below historical sample mean ~352). On-hand=76, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (confirmed earlier as 0). For demand forecast, use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 7\u201318, length=12) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; set sigma_hat using the same recent_N to capture current volatility. This keeps base-stock tailored to the new lower-demand regime, reducing overstock/holding cost while maintaining serviceability.

A sustained demand regime shift was previously detected (recent lower-demand regime sustained across multiple periods). To capture the recent lower demand, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 6 demand observations; likewise set sigma_hat using recent_N over the same 6 to reflect recent volatility. L uses default (promised lead time = 0). These choices bias the base-stock toward the current lower-demand regime, reducing overstock while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff.

On-hand=36, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline so avoid overstock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so keep promised/default L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent regime length (Period 7 onward = 14 weeks) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps order size proportionally, lowering holding costs while maintaining service on the reduced demand.

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical baseline samples show mean ~352, but a sustained lower-demand regime was detected earlier (Periods 1-6 avg=163, sustained). Recent periods include low true demand observations (Periods ~17-20) though Periods 21-22 show large reported demand but sales were stock-limited. I therefore keep promised lead time (0) and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (use last 6 demand samples that reflect the regime). This biases the OR base_stock down to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the lower observed demand level.

Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand volatile: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 19-24) = [34,27,121,122,137,76] with mean ~86. To capture current short-run regime and avoid overstock given holding cost, set lead time to measured average of observed lead times (all concluded lead_times = 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the most recent demand pattern (covers review+lead period implicitly). This balances service (responding to recent spikes) while limiting holding cost from older high historical means.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent realized demand shows high variability with a recent 6-period average \u2248104 units/week (periods 20-25 demands: 27,121,122,137,76,140) which is below historical sample mean but above earlier depressed regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must target (1+L)-period demand using recent behavior. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (6-week window) and respond to the rebound in demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent weeks (Periods 21-26 demands = 121,122,137,76,140,180) show continued lower-than-historical demand but some mid-year spikes and recent stockouts. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 historically; no recent evidence of lead-time drift. I choose L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 21-26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets stock for the current observed demand level while avoiding overstock from older high historical samples. No explicit adjustment for missing shipments is needed (no in-transit and arrivals have been consistent).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent 7 concluded demands (Periods 21-27) = [121,122,137,76,140,180,184], recent average \u2248132, showing higher mid-summer demand and greater variance vs early-year samples. No overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent summer demand regime (captures mean increase and higher volatility) so the OR backend will raise base-stock and the cap appropriately to avoid stockouts while respecting holding cost tradeoffs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent periods (P21\u2013P28) show elevated and volatile demand with multiple stockouts, indicating the recent demand regime is best captured by recent samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use the promised (and observed) 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 weeks (Periods 21\u201328) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher/volatile demand and reduce understock risk given profit>holding (high service target). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock from recent mean/volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased in late summer (Periods 24-29: 76,140,180,184,272,215) so I use recent sample-based forecasts to capture the higher mean/volatility. Promised lead time=0 has been consistently observed historically, so use default L. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=6 to reflect the most recent regime (captures last 6 demand observations) so the OR backend raises the base stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for higher variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: recent Periods 26-29 avg demand=212.75 vs prior recent avg=163 (~+30%), sustained over 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has risen since Period 26: last 5 demands (P26-P30) = [180,184,272,215,300], avg \u2248230.2, well above the prior low-regime mean (~163). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline coverage is zero; use a short (promised) lead time and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new higher regime. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility to the new regime and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many orders ordered and arrived same period). Demand regime increased starting Period 26 (sustained higher weekly sales across Periods 26\u201331); therefore I use recent demand statistics to reflect the new higher demand while keeping L at the promised/observed 0. This balances service (capture higher demand) vs holding cost by sizing base stock from the recent elevated mean and recent volatility.

Demand has risen since Period 26 and the recent regime (Periods 26-32) shows higher weekly demand; to capture this, I forecast using the most recent 7 weeks. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to align the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the current higher-demand regime, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows confirmed lead time=0 in concluded periods and a demand regime increase around Period 26 (higher mean since then) but Period 33 demand=704 is a likely outlier. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (periods 26\u201333) to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime while diluting the single large outlier. Sigma uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while avoiding overreacting to one extreme spike; they also account for zero pipeline so orders will be sized to cover (1+L) review+lead demand.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To adapt the OR backend to the recent higher-demand regime, set L via observed lead times and use recent demand stats over the most recent regime (Periods 26-34, length=9). This increases the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility estimate so the base-stock target better balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime since Period 26 (sustained higher weekly sales through Period 35, including spikes P33-P35). On-hand=195, in-transit=0; with lead time historically confirmed at 0, arrivals happen same period. I select L=default to retain promised 0 (historical observes 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-26 higher-demand regime (roughly 10 recent samples) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility (including the spike in P33) so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost using current demand mean and variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 26 (sustained higher weekly sales, including spikes around Periods 33-35). Current on-hand=236, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime while limiting inventory holding, I use L=default (promised 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will be computed from the most recent regime (Periods 26\u201336): use recent_N with N=11 to capture the last 11 observations so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for current demand and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (observed consistently). Recent demand has shifted upward (large weekly demands in Periods 32-37), so I use recent_N=6 to capture the current higher regime for both mean and volatility; L left at default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. This raises the base_stock to better cover elevated demand while sigma recent_N improves safety stock sizing.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=163, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 31-38) elevated: [240,279,704,397,250,197,310,348], indicating a new higher-demand regime vs the earlier low regime. I set L to default (promised = 0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent elevated mean and volatility so the OR engine raises base stock to meet current demand while limiting excess holding from older low-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=219, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (many arrivals same period as orders). Demand has recently returned to a higher regime (Sept\u2013Oct weeks) \u2014 recent 6-week mean ~293 units/week vs long-run sample mean 352 and earlier low-regime ~163. To be responsive to the recent higher demand while keeping holding cost in check, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 concluded demand observations (captures current regime). This gives the OR engine a short review+lead window aligned to current demand and preserves its capped-order behavior.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (many periods). A sustained demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 26 (recent P26-29 avg \u2248212.8 vs prior \u2248163, +~30%) and remains relevant through recent weeks. To reflect the higher recent demand I use recent_N over the most recent 15 demand periods (captures P26\u2013P40 regime), keep lead time as default (promised 0 / confirmed 0) and compute sigma from the same recent window. This raises base_stock to reduce stockouts given profit>holding, while sigma based on recent data keeps safety stock aligned with recent volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=158, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many arrivals same period). Demand has risen since the low regime around Periods 7\u201326; recent weeks (roughly Periods 34\u201341) show elevated demand (~308 avg over last 8 concluded weeks) compared with earlier depressed averages. I therefore keep L = promised (confirmed 0) and use recent_N demand estimates to capture the newer, higher-demand regime while also using recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast anchored to the upshifted recent sales, improving service while limiting extra inventory holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4 (q=0.8 implies safety stock but we let backend compute exact z via q).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no incoming arrivals visible. Recent demand has recovered from the low-regime (~163) into a higher regime since ~Period 26; last 6 demand samples (Periods 37-42) = [310,348,257,260,243,598], mean\u2248336. Use promised lead time (0) which is well supported by many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps target base-stock responsive to increased demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods. This addresses missing pipeline (none) by raising the forecast to cover (1+L) periods of demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=318, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods ~38-43) exhibits elevated level and high variance vs earlier low regime, so I bias forecasts to recent data to reflect the current higher/volatile demand. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies high target service level (q=0.8); using recent_N=6 captures the most recent demand regime and volatility while remaining responsive to change.

Recent demand has been variable but elevated versus early-year low regime; I use a recent-window to capture the latest demand pattern (including the large spike in Period 42). Set L to promised (default 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the last 6 observed demands (Periods 39-44) so the OR engine bases the base-stock on the most recent regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture recent demand volatility. This balances service (responding to recent higher mean and volatility) against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 across many periods; recent demand has bounced but no new sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift). To keep policy aligned with observed quick replenishment and avoid excess holding before year-end, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (quick replenishment) against holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=214, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical sample mean=352 but demand has moved multiple times; recent 4 concluded periods (P43-46 demands=131,171,167,106) average 143, a sustained drop vs prior recent avg\u2248213. Set L to default (promised lead time=0) since lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime over the last 4 periods. Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match lower demand and limit holding cost given substantial on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: recent Periods 43-46 avg demand=143 vs prior recent avg=213 (\u2248-33%), sustained over 4 periods.
