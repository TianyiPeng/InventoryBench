Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: 41,41,41,47,51 (mean\u224844.2, std\u22484.12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time or regime shifts. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates from full sample to provide a stable baseline (mu_hat and sigma_hat default). This balances service (cover ~44 units/week) against holding cost given low observed variance and limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples average ~44.2 (samples: 41,41,41,47,51). Period1 confirm: an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=49, lead_time=0) and sold out (demand exceeded on-hand). No evidence of changed demand regime or prolonged delays. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 0). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples; this balances service level (captures historical mean) against holding cost given current zero on-hand/in-transit and single confirmed zero lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded periods show two large demand spikes (sold 49 vs demand158, sold103 vs demand392) compared with historical weekly samples (~41\u201351), indicating a recent upward demand regime starting Period1\u20132 but only 2 periods of evidence (insufficient to declare a sustained shift). Both prior orders arrived same-period (observed lead times = 0). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual observed lead time = 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to bias the forecast toward the recent higher demand while still including the last available sample before the spike (captures short-run regime sensitivity). Sigma_hat left as 'default' to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L), avoiding overfitting variance to the two high-demand periods. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service given the apparent surge while keeping dispersion conservative to limit excessive holding cost risk.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand is sharply higher than historical baseline: Periods 1-3 demands = [158,392,359] while historical weekly mean (Jan samples) = 44.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times in concluded history = 0, so use calculated lead time. Demand regime change is sustained for 3 periods; use recent_N (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new high-demand regime while limiting excess safety stock from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg=303 (Periods 1-3) vs historical avg=44.2 (Jan samples), increase +258.8 (+586%), sustained 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $905.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has shifted sharply up: Periods 1-4 demands = [158,392,359,263], recent mean=293 vs historical ~44. On-hand=147, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments (observed lead times all 0). To capture the confirmed, sustained regime change (4 periods), set lead time based on observed history and base demand forecast on the most recent regime. L chosen to be calculated from observed lead times (all 0). mu_hat uses recent_N over the last 4 demand samples (regime length=4) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of those 4 periods (~293). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect current volatility in the new regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the much higher recent demand while avoiding reliance on stale historical lows, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand has jumped sharply from historical Jan mean (~44.2) to high weekly values in Periods 1-5: [158,392,359,263,192] (sustained increase). On-hand=190, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and all concluded arrivals showing lead_time=0, I treat lead time as default (promised). To capture the new high-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples (regime length=5) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of these high values rather than the low historical Jan mean. I use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase base-stock to meet current elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability prevents underordering; using default L keeps the backend aligned with observed 0-period arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and sustained (Periods 1-6: 158,392,359,263,192,179) vs historical Jan mean ~44. On-hand=180, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and observed concluded lead times=0 each period. I keep L at default (promised=0) because concluded lead times confirm 0. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (regime length=6) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility using the most relevant recent samples, balancing higher service needs against holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 1 (Periods 1-7 show consistently large weekly demand vs the small Jan samples). On-hand=60, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; recent weeks sold-through has been large so maintain higher target. Lead time: all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so set L to be calculated from observed lead times (avg=0). Demand forecast: use recent_N with N=7 (regime length = 7 periods) so mu_hat reflects the high recent average rather than diluted historical Jan samples. Volatility: use recent_N N=7 to capture recent demand variability. These settings raise the base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess stock from older low-demand history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent weekly demand has stepped up sharply vs Jan samples: recent demands (P1-P8) = [158,392,359,263,192,179,281,359]; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Observed concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1-P8 arrived same period), so set L by calculate (average observed lead time = 0). Demand is volatile but clearly at a higher regime; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior. I choose N=5 (Periods 4-8 recent mean demand = 254.8) so backend will compute (1+L)*mean over last 5 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward serving the elevated recent demand while limiting inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 (see prior carry-over). On-hand=102, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. All concluded lead-times = 0 so actual lead time remains 0. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. To capture the confirmed high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent stable window: use recent_N=5 (Periods 5\u20139 demand = 192,179,281,359,215; recent mean \u2248245.2). With L=0, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean will target ~245 units to cover current period demand while avoiding excess holding. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current demand volatility for appropriate safety stock sizing. This balances service (meet high demand) vs holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand is materially higher than the Jan baseline: last 5 demands (Periods 6-10) = [179,281,359,215,173], mean \u2248 241.4 units/period. On-hand=136, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments visible. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently. I set L=default (promised 0) to reflect observed on-time arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean \u2248241.4) so the base-stock targets higher service levels; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent volatility and scales safety stock to current variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while letting the backend cap limit excessive orders to control holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so use calculated lead time=0. Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (last 5 demands: 281,359,215,173,160; mean\u2248237.6) \u2014 I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand and avoid understock. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters direct the backend to raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand at the current profitable service level (profit=$4 vs holding $1) while accounting for recent variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in Periods 1\u201312 all arrived with lead_time 0). On-hand=197, in-transit=0. Demand history shows a prior large regime shift vs Jan baseline (already recorded), but recent weekly demand has softened: last 6 demands (Periods 7\u201312) = [281,359,215,173,160,111], avg \u2248216.5. To balance service and holding cost I set lead time based on observed lead times (calculate) and forecast demand using a recent window to capture the current, lower post-spike regime. I choose N=6 (captures the recent downward drift while keeping sample \u22653 and \u226420). sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These parameters provide the OR engine a forecast responsive to the recent demand pattern while recognizing reliably zero lead time and current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=214, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 for all completed orders \u2192 use calculate to let backend confirm average (expected 0). Recent demand since Period 1 is materially higher than the Jan sample mean (sustained high-demand regime across 13 periods); to capture current regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects recent demand. Volatility also driven by recent data, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability moderates safety stock to control holding costs.

Historical Jan samples mean=44.2 but recent selling history (Periods 1\u201314) shows a sustained, much higher demand regime; to capture current demand pattern I use recent data. No concluded late or lost shipments (all observed lead times = 0), so keep L as default (promised). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N using the last 14 demand samples (all available recent periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflecting the new regime; this balances higher service level against holding cost given ample on-hand stock.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised lead time. To keep service vs holding balanced given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1 (q=4/5 high service), use a short recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0).

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 in all observed arrivals; on-hand=173, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 15-19) = [106,71,46,43,74], recent 5-week mean = 68 units/week. With profit $4 and holding $1 the service target is high, but current on-hand already covers ~2.5\xd7 the (1+L) recent demand. I therefore use L=default (promised lead time=0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with the high service weight.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent concluded history shows stable zero observed lead time (all concluded arrivals indicate lead_time=0). On-hand = 182, in-transit = 0; recent weekly demand has been moderate (weeks 17-22 demands: 46,43,74,59,70,53). Profit=4, holding=1 (high service weight). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed confirmations consistent). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps the policy stable given no new sustained demand regime changes in concluded history and avoids overreacting to recent variability while leveraging the backend's service-level math.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). SKU 675068002 on-hand=205, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (multiple periods show arrived units same period ordered), so use promised/default lead time. On-hand stock covers several weeks of recent demand (recent weekly sales ~40\u201370), so avoid aggressive replenishment. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend leverages full-sample demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and the capped ordering rule to balance service level (profit $4/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=212, in-transit=0. Recent observed weekly demand has fallen to ~46 units/week over the last 8 periods (Periods 17-24: 46,43,74,59,70,53,26,15 => mean=48.25). No recent evidence of sustained high-demand regime; prior large spike was earlier and is no longer present. Promised lead time is 0 and recent concludes show arrivals on-time, so use default L. To keep inventory efficient versus holding cost, I set demand forecast using recent 8-week average (captures current low-demand regime) and set sigma based on the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This will reduce target base stock and limit overstock while maintaining service given current low demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=190, in-transit=0. Historical early periods show a large spike (recorded carry-over), but demand has been low and stable since Period 17 (demands: 46,43,74,59,70,53,26,15,22 over Periods 17-25). No evidence of new sustained shock. All concluded lead_time observations = 0. To avoid overstocking from early high-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times, and set demand forecast using a recent-window to capture the lower recent regime (N=9 covers Periods 17-25). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters keep base_stock tied to recent lower demand while recognizing verified zero lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=160, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0; concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (orders in Periods 1\u201326 that arrived have W=0), so use default lead time. Demand has clearly declined/stabilized since Period 17: Periods 17\u201326 demands = [46,43,74,59,70,53,26,15,22,30] (10 samples) \u2014 a lower, stable regime vs earlier high-demand weeks. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (N equals recent regime length capped by rules). Using recent data reduces over-ordering from older high-demand periods. With L=default, (1+L) review window is 1 period; the OR backend will compute base_stock from these recent mean/variance estimates, balancing higher service (via recent variability) against holding cost given current on-hand=160 and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=127, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has been low and stable (~15\u201333 units) for many periods (Periods 17\u201327), indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier high-volume weeks. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent stable regime (Periods 17\u201327 \u2192 11 samples). No overdue or lost shipments detected.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand has settled at moderate levels after the early-year spike. On-hand=107, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for ~2\u20133 weeks at current rates, so we can use recent demand to set forecast. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods, so set L by calculate (average observed lead times=0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime: I choose the last 12 concluded demand samples (Periods 17\u201328) because they represent the current post-spike pattern (N=12 is >=3 and <=20). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent lower-volatility regime, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service given on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, and demand has been in a lower regime since Period 17. I set L to use recent observed lead times behavior (stay at promised/observed 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 17-29) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (avg ~40 over those periods) so the OR backend will size base stock to recent demand and avoid excess holding given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand Periods 17-29 = 40.0 (13 weeks) vs prior Periods 1-16 avg = 199.06 (\u221279.9%), sustained 13 periods

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 17 (avg \u224840 over Periods 17-30) vs much higher earlier demand; no recent arrival/lead-time issues. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because all observed concluded lead_times are 0. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overstock, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime (Periods 17-30, 14 weeks): mu_hat recent_N N=14 and sigma_hat recent_N N=14. This biases the OR backend toward a lower base-stock matching current demand while keeping safety stock from the estimated recent variability, trading off service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been in the low-30s since Period 17 (avg \u224840 over P17\u2013P31), a sustained low-demand regime vs earlier high volumes. On-hand=22, in-transit=0 \u2014 below one-week demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (periods 17\u201331) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (regime length=15 \u2192 N=15). Same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed lead times in concluded history are 0 \u2014 use promised lead time. To forecast demand across review+lead, use a recent_N demand estimate that captures the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201332, regime length 16) so the backend reduces orders vs the historical high-demand periods. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices keep service for the current low-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost given limited on-hand and zero pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many periods with 'lead_time was 0'), and recent demand regime dropped starting Period 17 (Periods 17\u201333 average ~40 units vs prior ~199). No evidence of sustained lead-time increase or lost shipments. I set L=default to trust promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201333) to avoid upward bias from early high-demand periods: N=17 captures that regime. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the base-stock on the lower recent demand, reducing overstock/holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 17 (avg \u224840 over P17\u2013P29) and recent weeks (P31\u2013P34) demand around 30\u201365 with on-hand 22 and in-transit 0. All observed concluded lead times = 0, so use promised lead time. To capture the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility, using the regime window from Period 17 onward (Periods 17\u201334 = 18 weeks) so the forecast reflects the lower mean and reduced variance versus the early high-demand regime. These parameters bias orders down to avoid holding cost while preserving service under the confirmed low-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31-35) ~40 units/week; a prolonged lower-demand regime began at Period 17 (~40 avg) per carry-over. No evidence of changed lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0 repeatedly). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised/default lead time, but set demand forecast using recent data from the low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised lead time (0); mu_hat=recent_N using the recent low-demand regime (N=20) to capture sustained lower mean; sigma_hat=recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. This balances service level (matching current lower demand) and holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (avg \u224840/week); to reflect this sustained regime and avoid overstocking, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (covers Periods 17-36). This prioritizes matching the current low-demand mean/volatility so the OR backend reduces order quantities and holding costs while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent 0-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 31-37) is lower and more variable than the early high-demand regime; to capture current regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 7 weeks to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for recent demand rather than inflated historical peaks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods. Demand settled into the low regime beginning Period 17 (avg \u224840); recent weeks show modest variability with occasional spikes (e.g. P38 demand=165). To focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand moments with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 weeks of the low regime). L uses default (promised=0). This balances service (by sizing to recent demand) against holding cost given low average demand and no pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep L=default. Recent demand (most recent 5 weeks: Periods 35-39 = 38,24,82,165,112) shows elevated mean and high variability vs earlier low-demand regime; to capture current level and volatility I use a recent_N forecast on the last 5 samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher base-stock while reflecting recent variance. This balances service (capture recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting influence to a short recent window rather than all historical data.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 33-40) shows elevated and volatile weekly demand (65,34,38,24,82,165,112,127) versus the lower mid-year regime\u2014so forecast should use a recent-window to capture the current higher mean and variability. No concluded arrivals beyond Period 40 indicate no lead-time change; use promised/default lead time. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals historically; mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 weeks' higher demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility and inform the safety stock for the OR backend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=9, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 35-41 demands: 38,24,82,165,112,127,115). Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L. To capture the recent high/volatile regime I use recent_N on the most recent stable run: N=7 (Periods 35-41) which balances responsiveness and sample size. mu_hat uses recent_N N=7 to center the base-stock on recent mean demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target inventory to protect service during the recent higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 38-42) show elevated and volatile demand (165,112,127,115,295) indicating a renewed high-demand regime versus the mid-summer low. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0, so use promised lead time. To reflect the recent demand spike and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 37-42) to focus the forecast on the new regime while meeting service targets; keep L as default (promised lead time). These parameters prompt the OR backend to raise the base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts during this high-demand window while controlling holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=154, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a holiday-era demand spike vs the long low-demand summer regime: Periods 38-43 demands = [165,112,127,115,295,60], recent mean=145.7 (6 weeks) vs prior 13-week low mean\u224840. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded lead-time observations show 0 periods so far. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent Nov\u2013early-Dec demand spike (N=6 chosen = last 6 concluded demand samples; satisfies min N and captures the new regime). This raises the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility from the 295 spike\u2014balancing service level (q=0.8) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent weeks (Periods 40-44) show elevated and variable demand (127,115,295,60,73) consistent with a late-Nov/Dec spike; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Use promised lead time (default L=0). To capture the recent high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N, N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases the base-stock toward current elevated demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window so the OR backend will order to improve service in the holiday spike but limit excess holding costs after the season.

Demand had a one-week spike at Period 42 (demand=295) that is not sustained; the recent stable regime is Periods 43-46 (demands 60,73,59,52). To avoid the isolated spike biasing forecast, I use recent_N=4 for mean and volatility (covers the most recent stable 4 weeks). This balances service (captures current lower demand) and holding cost (avoids overstock from the single spike).
