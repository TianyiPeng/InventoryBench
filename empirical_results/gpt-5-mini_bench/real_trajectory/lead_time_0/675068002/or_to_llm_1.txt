Profit per unit = $4 > holding cost $1, implying a high critical fractile (q=0.8) and willingness to hold extra stock. I increase OR's recommendation slightly to guard against understocking given observed unmet demand in Period 8 and sustained high sales.

Recent sold history is volatile (P41\u2013P44 sold=115,295,60,73) with no new 3+ period sustained shift since the previously recorded surge; calendar is mid-December so upside risk exists but recent three periods (P42\u2013P44 sold=137,60,73 actually starting-inventory-constrained sales) do not confirm a sustained new higher regime. Requirement: with L=0 we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. Even under conservative high-demand estimate (use recent peak single-period sales ~137\u2013295), on-hand=162 already covers a likely single-period demand. Ordering additional units would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without clear evidence of sustained higher demand or lost shipments. OR recommended 27 units; I override and order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while on-hand is ample. Strategy: hold current stock to meet near-term demand; re-evaluate next period when we observe Period 45 conclude (arrivals/sales) and adjust if a sustained surge is confirmed.",
