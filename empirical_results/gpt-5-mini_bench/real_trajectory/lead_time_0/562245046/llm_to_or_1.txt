Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows steady upward trend (96,108,122,131,140). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 with no concluded arrivals to suggest a different lead time. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high service target (q=0.8). Use default lead time and demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances higher service level with holding cost given limited data and no confirmed regime/lead-time changes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Observed Period1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (weekly Jan): 96,108,122,131,140 plus most recent realized demand=155 \u2014 recent uptick. I set L to 'calculate' to lock actual observed lead time=0 from concluded data. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to emphasize the recent higher-demand regime (uses last 3 samples including the 155 observation) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent demand increase while using confirmed lead-time=0 to avoid overstocking for phantom delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period1: ordered P1, arrived P1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent observed demands were high (Period1 demand=155, Period2 demand=193) but both prior replenishments arrived same-period (observed lead time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need order coverage for current period demand. I set L to default (use promised lead time=0) because two consecutive concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this balances service level from historical demand samples with holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. No evidence of a sustained demand regime shift yet, so defaults are appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals with lead_time=0 and strong demand uplift: Periods 1-3 sold 155, 193, 207 (ending OH=0 each week). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we must replenish for current+lead demand. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time (0 periods). Demand appears to have shifted upward vs. the older 5-sample series, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 (the three most recent concluded demands) to capture the new regime and higher variability; this keeps the base-stock responsive and avoids over-reliance on pre-shift lower averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: recent avg demand = 185 (Periods 1-3: 155,193,207) vs historical sample avg \u2248119 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), +66 (+55%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed arrivals ordered P1\u2192arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand has risen sharply (last 4 weekly demands: 155,193,207,257) and on-hand + in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to meet elevated demand. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods; use calculated lead time to confirm. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the 4 most recent samples). This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and volatility, providing higher base stock to avoid stockouts while the OR backend caps orders via its cap. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand has increased sharply: P1-5 demands = [155,193,207,257,312], recent mean=224.8 vs historical sample mean\u2248119. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1\u2192P1 ... P5\u2192P5). I set L to default (promised=0) consistent with confirmed observations. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (use the 5 most recent periods). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a higher base stock to meet the sustained demand spike while using recent volatility to avoid over- or under-stocking given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periods 1-5: avg demand increased to 224.8 (P1-5) from historical sample avg \u2248119 (+88%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1\u2192P1 through P5\u2192P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $903.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical baseline (2019 Jan samples) shows lower mean, but recent periods 1-5 display a sustained demand regime shift (avg P1-5=224.8 vs historical \u2248119). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods through Period 6. To reflect the confirmed faster lead time and recent higher demand, set L via observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent 5-period regime (captures the sustained increase and recent variance). This ensures the backend's (1+L)-period demand estimate uses the current high-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost given on-hand inventory of 41.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P7) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded order) and a sustained demand uplift vs. 2019 sample baseline. I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 periods: P3\u2013P7) to capture the elevated regime while avoiding older low baseline samples; sigma_hat also uses recent_N over the same 5 most recent demand samples to reflect current volatility. This biases the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to meet current elevated demand while keeping holding impact accounted for via the backend cap.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has been consistently higher than historical 2019 sample (historic avg \u2248119). Last 8 periods demand = [155,193,207,257,312,236,211,305], mean=234.5 \u2192 sustained higher regime. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (orders P1\u2192P1 through P8\u2192P8). I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by arrivals). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime, so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to cover the higher demand while accounting for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periods 1-8: avg demand = 234.5 (Periods 1-8) vs historical sample avg \u2248119 (+97%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1\u2192P1 through P8\u2192P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead-time average (0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the elevated, sustained demand regime (uses last 8 concluded periods) \u2014 this raises the base-stock to meet service while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding given profit $4 vs holding $1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time repeatedly 0 (orders P1\u2192P10 arrived same period). Demand has sustained higher regime since Period 1 with recent weekly demand elevated (Periods 3\u201310 large). To reflect confirmed 0 LT use calculate for L. To capture the elevated recent demand and volatility, use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 observed demand periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most relevant regime and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Historical 2019 samples show a sustained, higher-demand regime vs the 2019 baseline: recent data (Periods 1\u201311) demand samples: [155,193,207,257,312,236,211,305,251,184,177]. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in multiple conclude messages (orders P1\u2192P1 through P11\u2192P11). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. I select recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated demand while excluding two lower recent dips (P10\u2013P11) that may be noise; using the last 8 periods balances responsiveness and stability. This will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while the confirmed zero lead time avoids extra pipeline padding, helping the OR engine balance service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost (sigma_hat captures variability).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 (arrivals P1\u2192P1 through P12\u2192P12), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted up and recent weeks remain elevated; use recent_N=5 to capture current mean/volatility (captures Weeks P8\u2013P12: 305,251,184,177,211) so the OR backend will size base-stock to meet the higher short-run demand while limiting inventory growth given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periods 1-12: avg demand = 224.9 (Periods 1\u201312 total=2699, avg=224.9) vs historical sample avg \u2248119 (+89%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed arrivals ordered P1\u2192P1 through P12\u2192P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Demand has been persistently higher than historical samples for many periods (Periods 1\u201312 avg \u2248224.9 vs historical sample avg \u2248119, ~+89%). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (P1\u2192P1 through P13\u2192P13). To reflect the sustained demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to prioritize service level on the current higher-demand regime while keeping L at promised/observed 0. This gives the OR engine demand estimates based on the most recent 12 periods where the elevated regime is confirmed, and volatility based on the same window so the cap/stock calculation accounts for recent variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical samples show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (avg \u2248225 over Periods 1\u201312 and continued high demand through Period 14). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (orders P1\u2192P1 through P14\u2192P14). To reflect the sustained demand regime while giving the OR engine recent demand evidence, set L to promised (0) and use recent_N=12 for demand mean and volatility (captures the elevated regime without diluting with older 2019 baseline samples). This increases target base-stock to meet current demand while keeping sigma estimated from the same recent window for appropriate safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Observed sustained higher demand vs 2019 sample (historic mean\u2248119); recent periods show elevated sales though P14-15 dipped. Lead time has been reliably 0 in concluded history (P1\u2192P1 through P15\u2192P15). On-hand=187, in-transit=0. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N window (N=12) to capture the sustained higher regime while smoothing the last two lower observations; same window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a base-stock appropriate for the new demand regime while avoiding overreaction to the last two low periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=220, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand exhibited a sustained high regime earlier (~avg 225 through Period 12) but has declined over the last 4 periods (Periods 13-16 demands = 225,145,82,51; recent avg \u2248125.8). To avoid excess holding while preserving service, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast demand using the most recent short regime: use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand and its volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13: recent Periods 13-16 avg demand = 125.8 vs earlier Periods 1-12 avg = 224.9 (\u221244%), sustained 4 periods; lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed arrivals ordered P1\u2192P1 through P16\u2192P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (orders P1\u2192P1 through P17\u2192P17). Recent demand has declined: last 4 periods (P14\u2013P17) demands = 145,82,51,38 (avg=79). On-hand=182, in-transit=0. To adapt to the newer lower regime while preserving service, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility (4-period regime: P14\u2013P17). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost exposure while maintaining responsiveness given same-day arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime drop starting Period 14: Periods 14\u201317 demands = 145,82,51,38, avg=79 (vs prior Periods 13\u201316 avg=125.8), sustained 4 periods, \u221237% vs prior recent regime.

Demand has declined starting around Period 13 with a sustained lower regime over the most recent periods (Periods 14\u201318). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed zero lead time, I set L via calculate (use observed lead times) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast/volatility on the most recent 5 periods.

Recent demand has fallen vs earlier regime: last 3 demands (Periods 17-19) = 38,72,74 (avg \u224861). To avoid excess holding while matching current lower demand, set L to default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13 with the most recent 5-week demands (P17\u2013P21 = 38,72,74,69,88) averaging \u224868. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while meeting the current lower demand level; with L=0 the OR engine will place orders to replenish for immediate demand only.

With promised L=0 reliable, I choose default lead time so backend uses promised L=0.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has moderated from the earlier spike: last 5 demands (Periods 19-23) = 74,69,88,114,81 (avg \u224885). On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so available supply is low vs recent weekly demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1\u2192P1 through P23\u2192P23). To balance service and holding cost I keep promised/default lead time (0) and set demand forecast using the most recent regime (to avoid over-ordering based on earlier high-demand periods). Therefore I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the recent lower-demand regime while the default lead time keeps the engine aligned with observed same-period arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed across many periods). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 14 (sustained: P14\u2013P24). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 14\u201324) to capture the sustained lower regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock to match the lower demand regime, lowering holding costs while preserving service given observed lead time and recent demand stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed from Period 14\u201324: total=866 over 11 periods, avg\u224878.7 (vs historical sample avg\u2248119 and prior high-regime avg\u2248224.9); sustained 11 periods (\u221265% vs prior peak).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled into a lower regime: Periods 14\u201324 (11 weeks) total=866, avg\u224878.7 units/week, sustained for 11 periods vs earlier high-regime avg\u2248224.9. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 repeatedly. To match the confirmed fast supply and the new low-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default = 0) and base mu/sigma on the recent 11-week regime. This reduces overstock risk while honoring the OR engine's (1+L) aggregation and keeps service vs holding balanced given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage; recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime from Periods 14\u201324 (avg \u224878.7 over 11 periods) though Periods 25\u201326 show higher single-week demand (99,137) but not yet a sustained change. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from history. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=11 to reflect the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 14\u201324) so the OR base-stock balances service level against holding cost given current low demand and zero pipeline. This avoids overstocking based on earlier high-regime data while allowing the cap to moderate order size if volatility increases.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times consistently observed = 0; demand has moved between high (Periods 1\u201312 avg ~225) and low (Periods 14\u201324 avg ~79) regimes. Recent two weeks (P26\u201327) show a possible rebound (137,183) but not yet 3+ periods to call a new sustained regime. Use promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. Forecast demand using recent 5 periods (P23\u201327 demands = 81,52,99,137,183) to capture the recent uptick while limiting exposure to holding cost. Use same recent 5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to recent increases while avoiding commitment to a long high-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods through Period 28. Recent demand (Periods 26-28 = 137,183,187) shows a short-run rebound vs the low regime in Periods 14\u201324. To react to the apparent renewed demand while keeping safety constrained, I use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand on the most recent 3 weeks to capture the current upward trend. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect current variability and limit overordering into a possibly transient spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand increase starting Period 26: Periods 26\u201328 avg=169 vs prior Periods 14\u201324 avg\u224878.7 (+115%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed arrivals P1\u2192P1 through P28\u2192P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand increased starting Period 26: Periods 26\u201329 demands = 137,183,187,163 (avg\u2248167.5). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history strongly confirms 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher regime (regime length=4). Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings focus the base-stock on the recent elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has spiked sharply in Periods 30\u201333 (300,349,354,709) \u2014 four straight high-demand weeks; this appears to be a new, sustained up-regime starting Period 30. Lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep promised/default lead time. To react quickly to the new high-demand regime while the signal is fresh, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 observations (Periods 30\u201333) so the OR backend forecasts for the (1+L)-period review+lead window based on the current spike. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given immediate surge; using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility from the spike. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increase starting Period 30: Periods 30\u201333 demands = [300,349,354,709], avg=428.0 vs prior recent avg (Periods 26\u201329)=169 (+153%); sustained 4 periods, lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1\u2192P1 through P33\u2192P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has jumped sharply since Period 30 (Periods 30\u201334 avg \u2248432 units/week). On-hand=139, in-transit=0; with lead time effectively 0 in all concluded periods, current stock covers less than one recent-week demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 actual lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201334 avg \u2248432 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean uses those 5 samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects volatility in the same recent high-demand window. These choices push the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while keeping L aligned with observed arrivals.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in a high, volatile regime since Period 30 (weeks 30\u201335 demands: 300,349,354,709,448,375). On-hand=195, in-transit=0 \u2014 with promised lead time 0, current on-hand covers ~0.5\u20130.7 of a single recent week's demand, so we should target replenishment sized to recent-week demand. Lead time is confirmed 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high regime (Periods 30\u201335) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock and cap reflecting recent mean and volatility rather than long-run historical averages. This balances higher service level needed for the current spike while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 with large weekly demand spikes (Periods 30\u201336: 300,349,354,709,448,375,293). On-hand=255, in-transit=0 \u2014 modest buffer versus recent elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; use calculated average to capture that. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=8) for demand mean and volatility (covers Periods 29\u201336) so the OR backend builds base-stock for the current elevated demand while keeping caps derived from recent variability. This balances higher service level needed for current spikes against holding cost given on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=198, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods across concluded history (orders P1\u2192P1 through P37\u2192P37). Demand regime increased sharply starting Period 30 (Period 30\u201337 demands = [300,349,354,709,448,375,293,310]) \u2014 recent high-demand regime length = 8 periods. I choose L='default' to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current elevated mean and volatility from the last 8 periods so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized for the new regime and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods through Period 38. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 30 (sustained high-regime: Periods 30\u201338 demands = [300,349,354,709,448,375,293,310,482], mean\u2248392/?? wait recalc) \u2014 to be conservative and capture the current high-demand regime while the OR engine uses (1+L) scaling, I use recent_N over the last 9 periods (Periods 30\u201338) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reflects the confirmed high-demand regime starting Period 30 and avoids diluting forecasts with older low-demand periods. I leave L as default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history strongly confirms actual lead time = 0. The higher mu_hat and sigma_hat will raise the base stock and cap to reduce stockouts given current high demand, accepting higher holding cost given profit/hold tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=230, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0 periods through Period 39. Recent demand regime is elevated and volatile since late Aug/Sep (sustained high demands P30\u2013P39, with large spikes P33\u2013P35 and P38\u2013P39). To capture the most recent elevated demand level while smoothing volatility, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 6 concluded periods (Periods 34\u201339) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L at default (promised = 0) because observations confirm same-period arrivals. This choice biases orders toward meeting the recent higher demand (improves service and profit) while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety stock to limit excess holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Historical data and conclude messages show a consistently observed lead time of 0 periods; recent demand (Periods 33\u201340) is elevated and more volatile (709,448,375,293,310,482,284,288). To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I keep L as default (promised 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 33\u201340) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the most recent sustained high-demand window. This balances service level (q\u22480.8 given Profit=4, Holding=1) against holding costs by aligning base-stock to the recent elevated mean and observed volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=242, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders P1\u2192P1 through P41\u2192P41). Recent demand has been strong: Periods 34\u201341 average \u2248345 units/week. To capture the elevated recent regime while keeping responsiveness (lead time 0), set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand and volatility on the last 8 observed weeks (Periods 34\u201341). This increases target base-stock to service the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N tightens uncertainty to recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high from Period 30\u201341: total=4473, avg\u2248372.8 (vs historical sample avg\u2248119, +213%), sustained 12 periods; lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed arrivals P1\u2192P1 through P41\u2192P41).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead-time has been consistently observed as 0 periods through Period 42 (many concluded arrivals Pn\u2192Pn). Demand historically moved to a sustained high regime from Period 30\u201341 (avg\u2248373), then a one-period extreme spike at Period 42 (demand=999, likely Black-Friday/holiday surge). Because the Period 42 spike is a single extreme observation (not yet sustained), I use the promised/default lead time to keep ordering responsive (L=default). To capture recent elevated demand while tempering a single extreme week, I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=4 (Periods 39\u201342) so the OR backend weighs the recent surge but still reflects the last weeks. For variability I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect observed recent volatility. This balances service level during the holiday surge against holding cost given zero current inventory and immediate arrivals with L=0.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders P1\u2192P1 through P43\u2192P43). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 30 (avg \u2248373 over P30\u201341) with very large spikes in P42\u2013P43 (999, 922). To meet holiday peak service needs while respecting holding cost, I use promised lead time and a recent-demand forecast that emphasizes the most recent high-demand regime. Therefore: L=default (promised 0, supported by concluded history); mu_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture the elevated demand pattern from Period 30\u201343; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture recent volatility. This increases the base-stock to protect service during the holiday spike while sigma based on recent volatility informs the safety-stock component.

Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=451, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods across many periods. Recent demand has been volatile with a sustained high regime from P30\u2013P41 (avg\u2248373) and extreme spikes around P42\u2013P44; current inventory is high so avoid over-ordering. Set L to promised (default 0) since concluded lead-time evidence is strong. Use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to emphasize recent demand while damping extreme spikes. Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility without overfitting to a single outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; on-hand=429, in-transit=0. Recent demand is volatile with a strong short holiday spike (last 4 demands: 999, 922, 210, 245; recent 4-avg=594). To balance service vs holding cost during the current holiday window, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast to recent_N (N=4) so the OR backend targets the short-run elevated demand; I also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma to capture recent volatility. No evidence of a new sustained regime beyond the holiday spike.

Daily Profit: $696.00, Daily Holding Cost: $778.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-82.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows large volatility with a prolonged high-demand regime from Periods 30\u201341 (avg\u2248373) followed by huge holiday spikes in P42\u201343 and then moderate demand in P44\u201346. On-hand=778, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost given continued elevated and volatile demand but some recent moderation, I keep L at the promised/default (0). I set mu_hat using an EWMA to emphasize recent weeks while retaining memory of the high regime (EWMA_gamma=0.3). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility explicitly. These choices instruct the OR engine to target a higher base stock reflecting recent elevated demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive overstock during dampening post-holiday demand.
