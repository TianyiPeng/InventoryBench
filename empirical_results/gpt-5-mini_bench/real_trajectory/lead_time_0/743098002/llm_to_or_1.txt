Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 743098002 has zero on-hand and in-transit. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) average \u224838 units/week; no sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time used; use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std. This balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded history: Period 1 order (38) arrived in Period 1 (observed lead_time=0). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=38 units/week. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift (only one observed lead time=0). Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. Use default demand sizing so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=38 and sigma_hat uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings keep base-stock tied to historical mean while avoiding overreaction to a single-period fluctuation; they also account for current on-hand when the OR engine computes orders.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 both arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 twice). No evidence of delays or lost shipments. Use observed lead time average to capture current reality. Demand history (five weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb) has mean ~38; with confirmed L=0 use default demand/volatility rules so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (profit=holding so q=0.5) while avoiding extra holding from inflated forecasts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (weekly): 46,33,53,37,21 (mean=38). Observed concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 show orders arriving same-period (lead_time=0). Profit= $1, Holding=$1 so q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 backend will set base_stock = mu_hat. I use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)=38 and sigma_hat from all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1,P2,P3 arrived same-period in conclude messages).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P4) confirms actual lead time = 0 and recent on-site demand has fallen (P1\u2013P4 demands: 26,23,14,4) relative to older samples. Use promised/default lead time (0) so arrivals remain same-period. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility; this reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent lower variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concluded lead-time consistently 0 (Periods 1-4 arrivals same-period). Demand recent periods: 26,23,14,4,12 (ending inventory trend steady). I keep L as default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed same-period arrivals. I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects overall historical demand while avoiding overreaction to short-lived dips. This favors service (profit per unit = holding cost) with moderate safety stock without extra explicit adjustments for volatility or short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has moderated: last 6 periods demands = [26,23,14,4,12,10] (mean \u224814.8) vs earlier sample mean higher; on-hand=17, in-transit=0 so current coverage is about 1 period at recent rate. Prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). I therefore keep L = default (promised 0) and use a recent_N demand forecast to reflect the recent lower-demand regime (N=6). sigma_hat kept default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce over-ordering versus older higher means while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed earlier). Recent demand has a one-off spike (47 in Period 7) but no sustained regime shift across >=3 periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments (which use all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on overall sample mean/variance rather than overreacting to a single spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times are all 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P8 arrived same-period), so use calculated lead time (average observed = 0). Recent demand had two high weeks (47,42) but this is only a 2-period spike\u2014no sustained regime change; therefore use default demand/statistics based on all samples to avoid overreacting. Using L=0 keeps (1+L) small so mu_hat reflects weekly mean; sigma_hat default captures historical volatility. No overdue shipments flagged.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has been variable (notably P7=47, P8=42, P9=28) but no sustained regime shift vs. historical weekly samples. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent with prior confirmation). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so we rely on base-stock calculation with promised lead time. I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given no clear sustained change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/22. Recent periods show a clear uptick in demand vs early periods: Periods 7-10 have elevated sales (47,42,28,21) compared with Periods 1-6 (mean ~14.8). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so pipeline does not cover expected next-period demand. Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes, so keep L=default. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures P6-P10 demand 10,47,42,28,21; recent mean \u224829.6) and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility (sample std \u224815.1). These choices bias the base-stock upward to preserve service during the sustained demand increase while sigma_hat reflects higher uncertainty to avoid extreme overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from ~14.8 (P1-6) to ~34.5 (P7-10), +132% relative; sustained elevation evident over 4 recent periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 7 (higher demand). Current on-hand=15, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To capture the elevated demand profile while remaining responsive, I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 7-11) to reflect the new regime mean (47,42,28,21,15) and reduce influence of older low-demand periods. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to match the same window. These settings steer the OR base-stock toward the recent higher demand while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (P1-4,P6,8-12 arrivals same-period). Demand regime increased starting Period 7 (P7-12 demands = 47,42,28,21,15,9; recent elevated mean ~27). I set L to default (promised = 0) consistent with confirmed same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 samples P7-12) so the base-stock and cap reflect the sustained demand elevation while avoiding overly long lookbacks. These parameters prioritize service for the higher recent demand while accounting for holding cost via the OR backend formula.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current demand. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0. Demand regime increased starting Period 7 and has remained elevated; recent demands (P7-13) average ~27 units/week. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0 (supported by concluded arrivals). I use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the sustained higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 7 samples). This balances service (cover current elevated demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent regime rather than long-run low-demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 7 (P7-14 demand elevated). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded messages. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime from P7\u2013P14, length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated recent demand and variability; this keeps base_stock aligned to current higher demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has accelerated: Periods 13-15 demands = [28,69,136], showing a new high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1-P15). No overdue shipments. I set L=default to retain promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime using the last 3 demand samples (most relevant for the OR base-stock calculation and cap). This raises target base-stock to serve the elevated immediate demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same 3-point window to temper excessive inventory holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand increased from ~34.5 (P7-10) to ~77.7 (P13-15), +125% (P13-15 = 28,69,136; avg=77.7).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals same-period) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 (high demand P13-16: 28,69,136,130). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the new high-demand regime. Set L to default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent concluded evidence. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high regime (Periods 13-16). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in this regime. These parameters steer the OR engine to target the elevated short-term mean while accounting for higher variability and avoid over-committing to older low-demand data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 13: demands P13-P17 = 28,69,136,130,115 (5 periods) with mean >> earlier regimes. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period plus lead. Lead time observed consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the confirmed high-demand regime length) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the most recent 5 samples. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the sustained elevated demand while sigma from the same recent window captures increased volatility and avoids understock. No evidence of lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals every period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (recent demands: 28,69,136,130,115,102). Use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=6 (captures the post-Period-13 high-demand regime) so the OR engine sets base_stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand elevated since Period 13: last 7 demand samples (P13-19) = [28,69,136,130,115,102,43], mean \u2248 90.4 and higher variance vs earlier regime. On-hand=54, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0 (Periods 1-19). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N N=7 so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples (captures current regime). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding exposure explicit to the backend (holding cost = profit so q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes confirm persistent lead_time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 13 (higher weekly demand, though recent weeks show some volatility). I set L=default to respect the promised/confirmed same-period arrival behavior. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 13-20) to capture the new high-demand regime (samples: 28,69,136,130,115,102,43,48) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the current regime. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 so variability is estimated from the same recent window. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while using recent observed volatility to limit excess holding (profit and holding cost equal, so accurate recent mean/variance is critical).

Recent demand is elevated and volatile (most recent demands P17-P22 = 115,102,43,48,60,99); to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 samples. This balances higher service need against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=2, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient versus elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised (default) lead time. For demand forecast use a recent_N estimate covering the current high-demand regime (N=11 periods: P13-23) to capture the sustained higher mean and variability. This raises base_stock to meet service while sigma from recent data informs safety stock to balance profit vs. holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 13 (avg ~77.7 over P13-15 and continued high volumes through P24). On-hand=62, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows 0 actual lead time. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (periods 13\u201324 constitute the current high-demand regime, regime length=12) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples, letting the OR backend adapt to the elevated demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=12 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize matching the OR base-stock to the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data; using recent_N reduces stockouts during this sustained high-demand period while the backend's cap limits extreme overordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods). Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (P13-25 high demand); I therefore use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. L set to calculated average observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 to span Periods 13-25 (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability). This raises base-stock to meet elevated demand while avoiding relying on older low-demand data; using recent volatility keeps safety stock responsive to recent swings.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent concluded arrivals). Demand elevated and volatile since Period 13 (previously recorded carry-over insights). On-hand=56, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed promised LT=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level given high observed demand and avoids overfitting to very recent spikes while letting OR engine apply its capped ordering policy.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows zero promised and observed lead time (confirmed P1\u2013P26 arrivals same-period). Demand exhibited past regime shifts (noted P7 and P13) but the most recent 5-week window (Periods 23\u201327 demands = 76,21,12,17,36) shows lower, more variable demand than the peak regime. On-hand=20, in-transit=0; with profit=holding cost, critical service quantile is 0.5 (z=0) so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. To balance service vs. holding cost and emphasize recent demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect current recent average demand (captures the post-peak softening) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility for the OR cap calculation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and sustained demand elevation since Period 13 (higher mean and variance). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish immediately to cover (1+L) periods. Set L=default to use promised lead time 0 (consistent with multiple concluded arrivals). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures the recent high and variable weekly demand: periods 24-28 = 21,12,17,36,70). These parameters bias the OR engine toward stocking for current elevated demand while limiting influence of old low-demand weeks, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Lead-time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders placed each period have arrived same-period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 12,17,36,70,116). I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime while smoothing short-term noise. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices direct the OR backend to size base-stock around the recent higher mean while accounting for higher variability, balancing service against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 13 (recent periods much higher than early samples). To capture the elevated recent demand, set lead time by calculation from observed concludes and use a recent-window forecast. L set to calculate (observed lead times all 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the post-changepoint high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods; this raises target base-stock to protect service levels given zero pipeline while controlling holding cost exposure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many orders arrived same-period), so set L to calculated average (will be 0). Demand experienced a sustained high regime starting at Period 13 (avg ~77.7 over P13-15) and continued elevated through recent periods (high weekly demand P16-P31). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201331, length 19) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current higher mean and volatility while respecting holding cost tradeoffs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus lead time. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0; demand regime has been elevated since Period 13 with high, variable weekly demand through Period 32. I set L=default to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (reduces influence of low pre-spike samples) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet current demand while capping orders via its cap parameter to limit overstock risk.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concluded data shows stable zero actual lead time (orders consistently arrived same-period) and two sustained demand regime shifts (P7-10 higher than P1-6; P13-15 and onward higher again). Recent high-demand regime has persisted from Period 13 through Period 33 (~21 periods). To keep service in this sustained high-demand regime I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand parameters to focus the forecast on the latest high-demand behavior. I choose N=20 (cap regime length at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are driven by the most recent ~20 concluded periods, which balances responsiveness to the sustained high regime while smoothing short-term noise. This increases the base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat captures recent volatility so the OR backend limits orders via its cap.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has been in a high regime since Period 13 with volatile weekly sales (~90\u2013130 in many recent weeks, but P34 dipped to 30). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L to keep rapid replenishment. To reflect the recent high-demand regime while down-weighting the single low week (P34), I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the last 5 demand samples (Periods 30\u201334: 127,104,90,115,30). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast focused on the most recent regime and captures recent volatility; with L=0 this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand=50.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence P1-P35). Recent demand remains elevated vs early periods but shows volatility (last 5 demands = 104,90,115,30,16; mean=71.0) so I use a short recent window to capture current regime while reflecting variability. Using L=default (promised lead time 0) keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed. mu_hat recent_N (N=5) targets (1+L)*recent mean to size base-stock to current demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent volatility for safety stock. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand shows elevated and variable demand since mid-2019 with last 6 period demands = [104,90,115,30,16,51] (mean ~67.7) \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime while keeping responsiveness to volatility. I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) so backend uses (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples and adapts to the recent elevated regime. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand spikes while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (many periods) confirm actual lead time = 0; demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 13 with volatile weekly swings. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise, set L to default (use promised/confirmed 0). Use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 weeks (captures the post-Period-13 regime while limiting influence of older low-demand periods). This balances service (avoid stockouts with elevated demand) vs holding cost by using a recent-regime estimate rather than all-time average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 13 with especially strong recent weekly demand (Periods 30-38). To align the backend base-stock to current elevated demand and recent volatility, I use a recent_N estimate focusing on the most recent 9 demand observations so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime while L remains the promised/default (0). This balances service (capture high recent demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean and volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been elevated vs early history; last 6 concluded weekly demands = [30,16,51,87,81,33], avg \u224849.7. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so coverage is ~1 week at recent rates; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so I keep promised/default lead time. To capture the recent elevated regime I set demand forecast using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by using a short, recent window rather than the long historical mean.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand remains elevated vs early periods; most recent 5 demands (P36-40 = 51,87,81,33,16) average ~53.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed historically). On-hand=34, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to cover expected (1+L) demand. I set L=default to use promised 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking \u2248 recent demand while keeping variability estimates current; they also avoid assuming unseen/late arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so use observed average. Recent demand remains in the higher post-regime levels (regime established P13 onward); recent week-to-week volatility is material. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior (captures current demand level and recent variability) so the backend's base-stock balances service vs holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-2). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence P1\u2013P42). Recent demand has been variable but the most relevant signal is the last 6 concluded demands (P37\u2013P42 = 87,81,33,16,13,14) giving a recent mean \u224840.7 and elevated volatility vs. the long-run. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) so the OR engine adapts to the latest regime. No new sustained changepoint detected this period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods. Recent history shows large summer peaks that have since subsided to moderate weekly demand (last 7 concluded demands: 87,81,33,16,13,14,10). With lead time confirmed as 0 and no clear new sustained regime shift, use default forecasting so the OR backend uses full-sample stats adjusted by (1+L). This balances service (cover same-period demand) against holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (sustained same-period arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 16,13,14,10,12) is consistently low relative to earlier high-season spikes, so I use a recent-window forecast to avoid overstocking. Choose L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)*mean over the five most recent observations, capturing the current low-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to estimate volatility from the same window. This keeps base-stock aligned to current demand and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry (service level implied by z*), while still reacting to any sustained change if it persists.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time confirmed at 0 periods (multiple confirms earlier). Recent demand shows a large spike in Period 45 (73 units) but prior weeks were low (Periods 41-44: 13,14,10,12). To balance risk of a short-lived holiday spike vs. holding cost, I bias the forecast toward the most recent 5 weeks to capture any elevated demand while not overcommitting inventory. Therefore: use promised lead time (default L=0), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect near-term demand, and keep sigma_hat default to use long-run volatility scaled by (1+L). This provides the OR backend a responsive mean while relying on default volatility and confirmed lead-time info.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows multiple sustained high-demand regimes earlier in year but no new sustained changepoint since Period 16; confirmed actual lead time = 0 (many conclude messages show same-period arrivals). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover this period's demand plus lead. Use promised/default lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding cost using full historical data without overfitting to short-term spikes. This approach is conservative given no new carry-over signal and the zero lead-time confirmation.
