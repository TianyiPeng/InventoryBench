Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) shows mean 90.4 units/week with high variance; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for immediate demand. No concluded arrivals exist to infer lead time, and promised lead time applies. Choose L=default to use promised lead time. Use mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures observed weekly demand average). Use sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (captures observed volatility). These defaults provide the OR engine with full historical demand signal while avoiding premature regime adjustments given limited data and no confirmed lead-time changes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent realized demand shows a clear upward regime since 2019-01-21 (125,150,153) versus earlier low/week (0,24). Period 1 sold=99, on-hand=112, in-transit=0. Observed lead time = 0 (Period1 order arrived same period). Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the new higher-demand regime (captures weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect volatility in the new regime. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the higher short-term demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent three-week avg = 142.67 vs prior two-week avg = 12 (+1088%); sustained high demand in 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 (125,150,153).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent history shows a clear demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (125,150,153 weekly). On-hand=82, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1,P2). To capture the elevated recent demand I set L via observed data and base demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime = 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). This ensures the OR backend sizes base stock for the current higher mean and volatility while respecting the confirmed short lead time and limiting excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1332.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): recent on-hand=93, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders from P1-P3 all arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent). Recent demand (sold) in concluded periods: 99, 102, 75 \u2014 higher than early-sample lows and reflects the sustained post-2019-01-21 regime. I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm actual lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (covers the three most recent sales: 99,102,75) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to measure current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples; using recent samples reduces overstock risk given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1523.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent selling history (last 4 periods demands = 99,102,75,82; mean=89.5) shows a sustained elevated regime vs pre-Jan weeks; on-hand=35, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Observed concluded lead times across periods 1-4 were 0 (orders arrived same period), so set L to calculated average (0). To reflect the most recent demand regime I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat ((1+L)*mean of last 4 periods = 89.5) and match sigma_hat to recent volatility using recent_N=4. These choices prioritize service against current elevated demand while avoiding excess holdings given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 for all observed orders (Periods 1-5), so I use calculate for L (avg observed = 0). Demand has shifted from Jan spike but recent five concluded demands (P1-P5: 99,102,75,82,69) represent current regime; I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service (capture current average ~85.4 units) while avoiding excess holding given low in-transit and holding cost $1/unit/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand has been declining from the earlier high-regime: last 6 concluded demands = [99,102,75,82,69,53] (mean \u2248 80). On-hand = 57, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so I keep L as default (promised 0). To capture the recent downward demand regime while using most recent evidence, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). Volatility has also compressed recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6 samples). These choices aim to reduce over-ordering given falling demand while preserving service by relying on the latest 6-week regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows earlier sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (high weeks 125,150,153) and a large censored spike in Period 7 demand=273 (stockout limited sales to 111). Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use default lead time. To capture the most recent demand level including the large recent spike while remaining responsive, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses last 3 observed demands) and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the recent elevated demand while sigma_hat captures increased uncertainty, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand shows a regime shift earlier (high weekly demand starting 2019-01-21) and recent volatility including a large spike (Period 7: 273). Current on-hand=208, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero. All concluded lead times = 0 (orders in history arrived same period). To balance service vs holding cost I use lead time estimate from observed data and focus forecast on recent demand: set L via calculation of observed lead times (stable at 0). For demand I use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture recent mean (smooths the spike) so base_stock reflects current demand level; use same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent high-demand regime while avoiding excessive overstock given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=202, in-transit=0. History of concluded arrivals shows all orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (125,150,153) with intermittent spikes (period 7 demand=273) but no new sustained shift since the prior insight. Given current on-hand cover and no pipeline, use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation consistently with observed same-period arrivals.

I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand periods: 53,273,126,66,88) so the backend targets a base stock that reflects the current elevated mean (~121 units) and higher variability, improving service while keeping holding cost in mind.

For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent demand level (weeks with demand 126,66,88,137 \u2192 recent mean \u2248104.25) so mu_hat reflects current demand without diluting with older low-demand weeks. Volatility also set recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability for safety stock. These choices aim to provide a base-stock that meets current elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given holding=$1/unit and profit=$19/unit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand history (periods 1-12) shows elevated and volatile weekly demand with mean \u2248105.7 units and std \u224855.6. On-hand=61, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times have been 0. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248105.7, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u224855.6) to set the base-stock\u2014this balances service (high recent mean) against holding cost given available inventory and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent realized lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). On-hand=141, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing shipments. Demand history shows volatile weekly sales but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Jan spike. Use promised/default lead time (0) since concluded evidence confirms it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance (1+L multiplier) to balance high service target (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods; no overdue or lost shipments observed. Recent demand (Periods 7-14) shows a lower, more stable regime vs earlier spikes; I therefore estimate demand using recent data to reflect current sales. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the last 8 weeks, which keeps safety stock aligned with current demand and avoids excess holding while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315) = [137,98,61,81,86], recent mean \u224892.6 and volatility moderate (~25). On-hand=144, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Use promised lead time (default) since observed lead time = 0 persistently. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-regime demand (last 5 weeks) and avoid diluting with early high spike. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to set base-stock around current weekly demand while limiting excess inventory given high on-hand stock and low holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 in every concluded period (orders arriving same period). Demand history (Periods 1\u201316) shows a past regime shift in Jan/Feb but no new sustained changepoint since; recent weeks demand is variable but not persistently different. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates, I use default lead time and full-sample estimators for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock is computed from overall mean/variance and the promised L=0. This balances service level against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been moderate after the earlier Jan regime shift; no new sustained changepoint detected. On-hand=135, in-transit=0, so we have healthy coverage today. All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 13-17 demands: 61,81,86,94,54) so the OR engine sets base-stock to meet current demand while limiting holding cost risk.

Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment. All concluded orders show actual lead_time=0 historically (orders placed arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Demand has a clear sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 but recent weeks (last 7 periods: demands = 61,81,86,94,54,43,112) represent the current operating regime; use recent_N=7 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to this regime so the OR backend targets service for current demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost. This balances profit vs holding by focusing forecast and uncertainty on the most relevant recent observations.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand volatile but no sustained new regime beyond the Jan spike already recorded. Recent 5 weeks (Periods 16-20) demands = [94,54,43,112,134], mean \u2248 87.4, variance moderate. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L as default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower/variable summer demand profile and respond quickly to recent changes while avoiding overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19. This balances service level with low holding cost by sizing orders to recent demand and volatility.

Recent demand has been elevated (recent demands: P16-P21 include 94,54,43,112,134,139) so I target recent demand to capture the current higher regime while keeping lead time at promised. Set L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 periods, which balances higher recent demand against holding cost and keeps orders responsive to current regime.

On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so current coverage is well below expected (L+1)-period demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep default lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target the most recent regime mean ((1+L)\xd7~135) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current short-term volatility and avoid overstock from older, lower-demand weeks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has been elevated: last 5 weeks demands = [112,134,139,132,95], recent 5-week avg \u2248122.4. On-hand=46, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage; lead times historically observed = 0 consistently. To keep service for current high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default) but estimate demand from the recent 5-week window so the base-stock reflects the current higher mean and volatility. Thus: L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. This boosts target inventory to meet short-term demand without over-reacting to older low-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change.

I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (captures current summer demand ~95\u2013139 range) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand patterns and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so use default promised L=0. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher weekly demand sustained thereafter). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand weeks, I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 20 weeks within the high-demand regime). This gives the OR backend a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility based on the recent regime, balancing higher service levels for elevated demand while avoiding oversized safety stock by restricting to recent data.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 7 weekly demand samples = [134,139,132,95,111,81,60], recent mean \u2248107.4, recent std \u224830.1. On-hand=126, in-transit=0 so current inventory already covers ~1 week of demand. All historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I choose L=default to use promised 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current lower summer demand regime and recent volatility, allowing the OR backend to compute a base-stock near the recent mean and avoid excess holding cost given sufficient on-hand stock.

Recent demand (last several weeks) is lower and more relevant than early-year regime shift; I choose recent_N=5 for demand estimate and volatility to reflect the current regime and avoid excess holding while preserving service.

To react to the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I use a recent-N estimate for demand (captures last 5 weeks: Periods 24-28) while keeping lead time at promised (default). This keeps forecast responsive to the latest demand pattern and reduces overstock risk given holding cost $1/unit/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=75, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times uniformly 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand has stabilized since the large early-2019 spike; recent weeks (Periods 21-29) show weekly demand mostly in the 37\u2013139 range with no new sustained regime shift. Given confirmed actual lead time=0 and stable recent demand, use default lead time and default demand moments. Profit/holding ratio implies a high target service level (q=19/20=0.95); using defaults lets the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with that service level while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Recent demand (30 weeks) mean \u224891.7 units/wk with no new sustained regime shift since the Jan spike already captured earlier. On-hand=136, in-transit=0 covers ~1.48 weeks of demand; using default (all-sample) \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 lets the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using full history, balancing high profit (P=$19) vs low holding cost (H=$1) and avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has settled well below winter/spring peaks; last four concluded weekly demands = [68,37,37,37] (mean 44.75, std ~15.5). On-hand=135, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0, so use default promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower regime while still capturing short-term variability, set mu_hat using a recent_N mean over the last 4 weeks and sigma_hat using recent_N over the same 4 weeks. This keeps target stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the high profit/low holding cost tradeoff (q\u22480.95) is handled by the backend's service-level translation.

Date 2019-09-23. Recent demand has settled well below the Jan\u2013Feb spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [60,57,68,37,37,32] (we focus on the most recent 5-period regime to capture current lower volatility). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Set L=default to keep backend lead-time assumption at 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variability (short window to react to regime shifts while avoiding the old spike). This biases orders toward current lower demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service given low observed lead times.

Recent demand (last 8 weeks: Periods 27-34) has averaged ~50.6 units/week and is lower than earlier seasonal spike recorded in Jan-Feb. No overdue/lost shipments currently. To avoid overstocking from early high-demand samples, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=8) so mu_hat reflects the current lower regime; keep L at default (promised=0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders reported lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been lower and more stable since summer vs the large Jan spike already recorded; to focus the forecast on recent behavior I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent weeks. I choose recent_N with N=6 (captures the last ~6 demand observations while respecting the N bounds) so the OR backend weights current demand level and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given current weekly demand ~30\u201360) against holding cost (low $1 per unit).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised L=0. Recent demand (last 8 weeks: Periods 30\u201337) shows a lower, stable regime (~50 units/week) versus earlier peaks; to keep orders aligned with current demand and limit holding costs I use recent_N for demand mean and std with N=8 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31-38) = [37,32,90,47,54,47,55,71], recent mean ~53 and moderate variability; no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded Jan 2019 spike. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time 0). Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so target higher service. Set L=default to use promised lead time=0, use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 weeks, which balances higher service level while limiting excess inventory given current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand appears stable at moderate levels (last 6 demands: 47,54,47,55,71,52; mean \u224854.3). On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs expected one-period demand (~54). Observed lead times historically 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L=default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to focus forecast on the current stable regime and avoid overweighting the early-2019 spike. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to capture recent variability. These params steer the OR backend to replenish toward a base stock matching recent demand while limiting holding cost exposure given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent weekly demand (Periods 34-40) has been moderate/low (range ~32\u201371, many ~30\u201355) after the large Jan spike already recorded in carry-over. On-hand=34, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I choose to keep promised lead time (L=default) and use a recent-demand estimate to reflect the lower, current regime: mu_hat based on recent N weeks to avoid Jan spike influence. sigma_hat left as default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These settings bias orders toward the recent lower demand while preserving service level against short lead time and minimizing holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has been lower and stable compared with early-year spike; last 8 concluded weekly demands (Periods 34-41) = [47,54,47,55,71,52,35,33], mean=49.25, sample std\u224812.04. I choose recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to align the (1+L)-period forecast with the most recent regime and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. No new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded Jan spike, so no carry-over update.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after a large single-week demand spike (144 on 2019-11-25) following several low weeks (33,35,52). Historical series shows no sustained (>3 periods) change in mean or lead time; promised lead time remains 0. I will use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend uses the long-run sample mean/variance, avoiding overreaction to the isolated spike while allowing the capped order cap to limit extreme orders. This balances service (captures typical demand) versus holding cost given no evidence of a persistent regime shift or lead-time change.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=123, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=0 (all concluded orders: lead_time 0). Earlier demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 is recorded in carry-over and already persistent; recent weekly demand is mixed but no new sustained change. No evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Choose default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this leverages long-run demand signal while avoiding overreacting to recent noise and keeps service level high given profit >> holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Recent demand (most recent 8 weeks) averages ~60.6/week with elevated variability due to one large week (Period 42=144). Historical lead times have been consistently 0 (observed arrivals labeled lead_time 0). To balance service and holding cost I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand on the most recent 8 weeks to reflect current seasonality while capturing recent volatility; compute sigma from the same recent 8-week window.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0, so use default L to keep backend assumptions aligned. Recent demand shows a one-period high spike (P42=144) followed by moderate demand (P43-45 = 38,57,58). To respond to the recent regime while avoiding overstock before year-end, I use a short recent window (N=4) for demand mean and volatility, which captures the spike plus subsequent normalization. This yields a (1+L)-period forecast that balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by raising the base-stock modestly above recent average demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent weeks (Periods ~37-46) show typical weekly demand mostly in the 30-70 range with occasional spikes (e.g., P42=144). On-hand =115, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is sufficient for near-term demand but not excessive given holding cost. All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0 (orders consistently arrived same period). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time shift detected. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history; this balances service level (uses long-run mean/vol) vs. holding cost without overreacting to short spikes.
