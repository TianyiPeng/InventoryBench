OR's capped recommendation is 211 (uses promised L=0 and historical pool), but given the recent sustained jump and risk that actual lead time may be \u22651 (which would require covering 2 periods of demand because arrivals occur after the decision), I increase the order to cover roughly two periods of current demand: 2 \xd7 142.7 \u2248 285 units.

{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Current on-hand = 63, in-transit = 0. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346) = 38,57,58,38 \u2192 average \u2248 48 units/week; earlier regime shift to higher baseline is already recorded in carry-over. With same-period arrivals, an order would immediately add to sellable stock, but current on-hand (63) already exceeds one-period expected demand (~48). OR's recommendation (94) targets a much higher base-stock using long-run/statistical parameters and the high critical fractile (profit/ (profit+holding)=19/20=0.95) which inflates safety stock; that would create unnecessary holding cost given recent post-Christmas demand lull. To maximize R_t (profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 holding_cost \xd7 ending_inventory) I will not order this period and let on-hand cover expected demand, avoiding extra holding cost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 actual lead time = 0 and on-hand 63 already exceeds recent one-week demand (~48), so OR's 94 is excessive and would raise holding costs.",
