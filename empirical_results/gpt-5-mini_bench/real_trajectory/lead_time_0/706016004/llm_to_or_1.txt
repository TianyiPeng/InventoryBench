Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [1,6,7,3,15] (latest 2019-02-04=15) showing higher recent demand and volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment coverage for current period demand. I use L=default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to emphasize the most recent regime (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) capturing the recent uptick. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices bias the base-stock toward servicing the recent higher demand while keeping holding cost pressure via the backend cap.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Last concluded period shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and P1 demand was censored (demand=57 but sold=19 due to stockout) so no reliable evidence of a sustained demand shift. I therefore use promised/observed lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on the full sample set to avoid overreacting to a single censored spike; sigma also default to reflect historical volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concludes show two same-period arrivals with observed lead_times=0 (Period1 and Period2). Demand spiked recently (57,72) vs earlier sample series (1,6,7,3,15). Spike is recent but not yet 3+ periods sustained, so I will set lead time from observed history (calculate=0). For demand I use a recent_N=3 window (last three demand samples: 2019-02-04=15, Period1=57, Period2=72) to capture the upward shift while still smoothing with the most recent pre-spike point; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (capture recent high demand) against holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1183.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows lead_time observed=0 for orders in Periods 1-3 (arrived same period). Demand has shifted sharply: concluded demands = {P1:57, P2:72, P3:64} vs earlier sample series mean ~6.4 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04). On-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to calculate (average observed lead times = 0) to match concluded evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 3 periods' demands). For sigma I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus orders on the new demand level while avoiding carrying inventory from old low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04)=6.4 -> recent mean (Periods 1-3, 2019-02-11..2019-02-25)=64.3 (+905%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders in Periods 1-4 all arrived same period). Demand has a confirmed regime shift: historical sample mean=6.4 but last 3 selling periods (Periods 1-3 of game history) show a sustained high mean (~64.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current high-demand regime. Choose L by 'calculate' to capture observed lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new high-demand regime (use most recent 3 periods to estimate mean and volatility), which increases target base-stock and the cap appropriately to balance high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand regime shows a sustained large increase (recent weeks much higher than historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. All observed lead times have been 0, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 3-5: demands 64,92,112). This balances higher service level against holding cost by basing forecast and volatility on the most recent 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent weeks show a sustained large demand regime (Periods 4-6 demand = 92,112,184) versus historical low-volume samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. I set L to default (promised 0) since concluded history shows orders consistently arriving same-period (lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the three most recent periods: 92,112,184) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for higher variance. This balances high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by emphasizing service (higher q) but using only the recent regime data to avoid diluting the forecast with old low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: historical mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04)=6.4 -> recent mean (Periods 4-6, 2019-03-04..2019-03-18)=129.3 (+1915%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $3171.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (sustained high sales in Periods 4\u20137). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; upcoming demand risk high so base-stock should reflect most recent regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 5\u20137), keeping responsiveness and avoiding overstating long-run averages.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime since Period 4 with high weekly demand (Periods 4-8). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so we are low relative to recent demand; promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I set L=default (use promised 0). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent 5 demand periods (Periods 4-8) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and caps to cover the elevated mean and observed volatility while limiting excessive holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand regime is much higher and sustained (Periods 4-9 weekly demand = [92,112,184,169,209,140], recent mean=151). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. On-hand=95, in-transit=0 covers ~0.63 of one-week demand => replenish. Choose L=default to respect promised 0-period lead time (supported by concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the backend to raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while keeping volatility estimate current for service-level sizing.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=115, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show every observed arrival had lead_time=0 (no evidence of delay); demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 4 (multiple periods). To capture the confirmed high-demand regime I set L by 'calculate' (uses observed lead times = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand observations: Periods 4\u201310) to reflect the new higher mean and volatility; this focuses the base-stock toward recent realized demand and keeps holding exposure low relative to service (profit/holding => high service weight).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 4 (large, multi-week increase vs. historical samples) and observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand=123, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To capture the recent high-demand regime while keeping the OR engine responsive, I set L to promised (default = 0) and use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the most recent 6 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead window). This biases the base-stock toward the high recent demand, improving service while the sigma estimate controls safety stock to limit holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent periods (P4\u2013P12) show a sustained, much higher demand regime versus early history (confirmed multi-period surge). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). I keep L as default (promised = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime from P4\u2013P12, 9 samples) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead window; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while sigma_hat supports appropriate safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1514.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been at a much higher regime than the early historical samples; last 5 realized weekly demands = [140,110,94,97,86], indicating a stabilized higher-demand regime (~105/week). On-hand = 120, in-transit = 0 so available covers ~1+ week of demand already; no overdue shipments observed and all concluded lead times = 0, so promised lead time remains accurate. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because every concluded order since Period 1 arrived same-period. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (avoids diluting with low historical values). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand variability. These settings steer the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the current elevated mean while keeping holding cost exposure in check given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has stabilized at high levels (~90-100 units/week) for several periods; on-hand=41, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments indicated (all concluded lead_times=0). To reflect confirmed same-period arrivals and recent high-demand regime, set lead time to calculated average of observed lead times (0). Use a recent_N demand estimate (last 3 weeks: demands 97,86,100) to capture the current regime for mu_hat and match volatility with sigma_hat using the same 3-week window. This balances service (meet ~100/week demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical observations show a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 4 (large, persistent increase vs early samples). Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L as default. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, focusing on the most recent regime (Periods 4+). This biases the base-stock toward higher replenishment to avoid lost sales while the OR backend uses the promised lead time and its capped order. No evidence of missing shipments to adjust L explicitly.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Demand exhibits a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 4 (many periods of elevated sales); to capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 13 samples (regime length since Period 4). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat toward the elevated recent mean/volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost penalties visible via the backend cap.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (recent demands P15..P17 = 137,151,163). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the forecast and volatility reflect the sustained higher sales and keep the base-stock responsive while avoiding excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Observed lead times across concluded history are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Demand has been in a higher sustained regime since Period 4; to capture current demand level while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand data, I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand samples reflect current regime, balancing service level vs holding cost). This keeps orders responsive to the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to single-week noise.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 4; historical lead times observed via concludes are consistently 0. On-hand=61, in-transit=0 so available inventory is limited vs. elevated demand. I keep L=default (use promised lead time 0) because concludes confirm 0 lead-time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 4..19, length=16) so the OR engine forecasts elevated mean and volatility and balances service level vs holding cost.

Demand has been in the elevated regime since early periods (sustained high demand through recent weeks); to capture current mean/volatility I use recent data window. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 12 demand observations to reflect the elevated demand and recent variance, so the OR backend raises the base-stock to preserve service while capping orders to limit holding cost.

Demand has settled at a higher regime vs. historical low-periods; recent demands (Periods 18-21 = 117,115,89,78) support using a short recent window to capture current mean/volatility. I select L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals, mu_hat=recent_N (N=4) to target the current demand level (1+L multiplied by mean of last 4 demands) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service (capture elevated demand) and holding cost by avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (sustained high weekly demand through Period 22); use recent demand to set mu and sigma so OR backend targets service with current high demand. I select recent_N with N=19 (regime length from Period 4\u201322) to capture the sustained high-demand level and volatility. This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime and keeps cap proportional to observed variability, balancing profit-driven service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 21-24) = [78,91,77,38], recent mean \u224871 \u2014 materially lower than earlier spikes; historical concludes show promised lead time=0 consistently. Use L=default to trust promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to focus forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (captures current sales pace and avoids overstocking). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility (including the drop to 38). This keeps base_stock aligned to current demand, limiting holding costs while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent weekly demand has declined from earlier extreme spikes; last 5 demands (Periods 21-25) = [78,91,77,38,62], recent mean \u224869.2. On-hand=47, in-transit=0 and lead-time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the current lower regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility rather than older high-variance periods. This keeps the base stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime and avoids overstock from earlier spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. All concluded lead-times historically = 0, so use calculated average lead time (confirms promised 0). Recent demand has been elevated vs early 2019 but shows some moderation late July\u2013early Aug (recent demands: 38,62,71,77,91,78,89,115). To balance service and holding cost I use a recent_N forecast to weight the recent regime: L set via calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current higher-but-variable demand pattern and recent moderation, keeping orders responsive while limiting excess holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand shows an upward short-run trend (Periods 24-27 demands = 38,62,71,91). Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use default lead time to keep backend alignment. To respond to the recent uptick while avoiding overreaction to earlier volatile spikes, set demand forecast using the most recent 4 weeks (captures the rising pattern). Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 so the base-stock reflects current demand level and short-run variability, balancing service (profit) vs. holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19). No in-transit arrivals expected to arrive this period (arrived confirmations occur in conclude messages).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks show sustained elevated demand vs original historical baseline; latest 5 demands = [38,62,71,91,58], on-hand=44, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time (default). To capture the recent high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-scaled demand, I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend emphasizes recent observations (regime length long since early March). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by keeping L=default and letting the capped order cap limit extreme orders.

Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 62,71,91,58,48) averages ~66; demand has moderated versus the large spikes earlier in the year.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has moderated to ~40\u201390 units (last several weeks ~48,55,46,58,91,71,62,38). On-hand=47, in-transit=0 \u2192 no incoming confirmed shipments. No new sustained changepoint detected since prior documented regime shifts. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because observed concluded arrivals consistently show 0 periods historically and no lost shipments recently. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding cost, set demand forecast and volatility from the recent window (captures current mean/variance). This lowers target base-stock vs. using long-run elevated averages, reducing expected ending inventory holding cost while keeping reasonable service. Methods chosen: L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 weeks, sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) for matched volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=51, in-transit=0 so we have ~1 week of stock at current pace. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the new, lower recent demand regime (capture (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 weeks and volatility of last 6 weeks). These parameters balance service (match recent demand) while avoiding excess holding cost given low holding=$1 and moderate profit=$19.

Recent history includes previously recorded sustained demand regime shifts (large increases earlier in the year) but no new 3+ period signal since Period 33. To keep OR backend aligned with observed lead time and let it compute demand statistics from full sample set, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (use observed data) against holding cost given limited on-hand and no pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 31-34) ~46,35,73,75 \u2014 no sustained new changepoint since prior recorded regime shifts. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed arrivals. Use default demand and volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)/sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend leverages full history while current on-hand already provides buffer.

Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to focus forecast on the latest demand regime and avoid overweighting older spikes. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand variability and keep safety stock appropriate given low holding cost (H=$1) versus profit ($19).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Recent demand last 3 concluded periods (P34..P36) = [75,67,60], showing a stable lower weekly run (~67 avg) versus earlier high-season spikes; no new sustained changepoint detected. Promised lead time = 0 and all observed lead times = 0, so use default lead time to keep arrivals same-period. To focus the forecast on the most recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures P34..P36 demand). This keeps the OR backend responsive to current lower demand and limits excess holding cost while preserving service for one-period demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 34-37 and earlier) has stabilized around ~60\u201375 units/week; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 samples for both mean and volatility so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding overweighting older high-volatility spikes. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by focusing safety stock on recent demand variability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 34-38) is stable around 59\u201375 units/week (mean \u224864.6) after earlier regime shifts; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (last 5 samples). Demand volatility has also settled, so use recent_N for sigma_hat (last 5 samples). These choices keep target service level high (q=profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95) while avoiding excess inventory by anchoring to the latest stable demand window. No overdue shipments visible (no in-transit), so no lead-time inflation applied.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been lower in recent weeks (~35\u201375, more recently ~60s), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 8 observed weekly demands (captures the recent lower-demand regime) and to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has moderated (weeks ~30-40 ranged ~43\u201375) and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. On-hand=34, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. To balance service vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: trust promised LT=0 and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history so orders reflect long-run demand while avoiding manual overstocking given current moderate demand.

Recent realized demand (many periods since peak) has settled lower than earlier spikes; to capture the current regime I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stocking for the most recent demand pattern and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history; no evidence of lead-time drift. Recent demand (Periods 40-42) = [49, 42, 143]; last period showed a large sellout (demand 143, sold 117) but this spike is not yet a sustained regime change. To respond quickly while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent 3-week demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the most recent regime without overcommitting inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand has been volatile: Periods 42-43-41 demands = 143, 54, 42 (recent mean \u224879.7). On-hand=117, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times in history are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. To capture the most recent regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u224879.7 units. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstocking from older high-season orders while keeping reasonable service for the recent elevated demand spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 43-44: 54, 34) but historical demand contains high spikes earlier (including Period 42: 143). On-hand =137, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock already covers near-term demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (consistent). No sustained new demand/lead-time changepoint identified. I select default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses the full historical sample to compute base-stock and safety based on the promised lead time; this balances the high profit (encouraging service) against holding cost while avoiding unnecessary manual overrides given ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand (Periods 43-45) = [54, 34, 64], indicating current regime mean ~50.7/week; holiday week may boost demand but recent data already reflects season. Promised lead time=0 with reliable historical arrivals. I set L=default to use promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the latest regime (captures recent lower-variance holiday demand signal) so the OR backend targets ~(1+L)*mean of recent demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability.

Recent demand (Periods 42-46) is lower and more stable than earlier spikes; to reflect the current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat focus on the last 5 samples and reduce excess holding while maintaining service.
