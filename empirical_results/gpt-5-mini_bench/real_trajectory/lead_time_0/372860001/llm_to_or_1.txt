Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860001 has no on-hand or in-transit stock. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) shows stable demand (mean \u2248266.4, sd \u224826). No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence; use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base stock and caps. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1) and limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0) and demand in P1 was 287 (sold 267, stockout occurred). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (observed=0) so backend learns actual lead time evidence. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (including the recent P1 demand) to form the base-stock; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each) and no current pipeline. These choices are conservative given limited new data and a stockout in P1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-2 had lead_time=0 (arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand history includes prior samples (Jan) and two recent demands (287,548) but only two post-change observations \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. I set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time (avg observed = 0). I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (conservative given insufficient evidence of a sustained demand increase). This balances service vs holding cost while we gather more evidence about the recent spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed concluded demands (Periods 1-3) = [287, 548, 399]; historical Jan samples mean \u2248266. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead times in concludes are 0 for all arrivals \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. To capture a sustained higher-demand regime over the last 3 periods, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) so the OR backend uses the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility of the most recent regime. L set to calculate to reflect average observed lead time = 0. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed demand uplift while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability. No explicit handling for lost shipments required.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1\u20133: recent avg demand = 411 (periods P1-3) vs historical Jan avg \u2248266 (+55%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs historical Jan samples (recent weeks demand: P2=548, P3=399, P4=338). On-hand=74, in-transit=0, so we must plan for elevated near-term demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use default promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 3 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run Jan variance. These parameters bias orders toward higher service (covers elevated demand) while keeping variance estimate recent to avoid overstock from older low-variance data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand shows elevated regime vs historical Jan; last 3 demands (P3-P5) average ~330 units. On-hand=177, in-transit=0 so current coverage < one-period expected demand; observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. Choose L by calculating observed lead time to confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent higher-demand regime while limiting influence of older January samples. These parameters raise the one-period base-stock to cover current demand surge without overstating variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use default promised L. Recent demand (last 6 periods = 287,548,399,338,252,329) is elevated and volatile; I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (mean \u2248358.83). With profit=holding, q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0 so base_stock will equal mu_hat; this balances service vs holding given recent elevated demand while reflecting increased variability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). All concluded orders (P1\u2013P7) show actual lead_time = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (P3\u2013P7 = 399,338,252,329,415) remains elevated versus historical Jan samples; I use recent data to capture current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent higher-mean, higher-variance regime and limit exposure to holding cost given profit=holding. This balances service level for ongoing elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory if the spike is transient.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand has shifted well above historical Jan avg; use all 8 recent concluded samples to capture current regime. Set L by calculate (observed lead times all 0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=8 and sigma_hat recent_N N=8 so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the current higher mean and volatility, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized weekly demand has averaged ~374 over the last 3 concluded weeks (P7-9: 415, 382, 322) and overall recent mean ~364 (P1-9). On-hand=47, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times in all concluded periods have been 0, so use calculated average to confirm L=0. To be responsive to the most recent demand regime while limiting excess inventory, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) which capture the current elevated demand without over-weighting older January samples. These parameters give the OR engine a short-horizon forecast and volatility estimate aligned with current demand, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has settled around ~330 units/week (last 3 periods avg ~337). On-hand=65, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover versus recent demand, so we use a short lead-time estimate consistent with observed conclude messages (all observed lead_time=0). To keep safety stock responsive to recent demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent data (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend targets service vs holding tradeoff using up-to-date mean/volatility. This addresses any transient spikes and avoids overstock from older low-Jan samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history (Periods 1\u201311) shows sustained higher weekly demand vs historical Jan baseline; observed lead times in concluded history are all 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover expected next-period demand. Set L by averaging observed lead times (all 0). Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend uses the full history to compute base stock; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand (Periods 8-12) remains elevated vs historical Jan baseline; observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. To reflect the recent regime, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using recent_N over the last 5 observed demand periods (periods 8-12) so mu_hat captures the current higher mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to match current demand while keeping holding exposure aligned to recent variance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weeks show a higher demand regime vs historical Jan mean (~266): last 5 concluded demands (P9-P13) = [322,308,427,438,267], recent mean \u2248352.4. On-hand=109, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L. To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I base forecast on the most recent regime: set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current elevated mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover current demand spikes while keeping holdings responsive to recent variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period, so use calculate to confirm L=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded demands: P10-14 = 308,427,438,267,275) shows a higher sustained mean (~343/week); use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture current regime. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments; parameters aim to match OR base-stock to recent elevated demand while avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Historical base (Jan samples) mean\u2248266 but recent weeks show higher demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand observations: P11-P15) because the recent regime average (~351) is meaningfully above the long-run Jan mean and persisted across the last 5 periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind given equal profit/holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 9-16 = 322,308,427,438,267,275,348,370) shows a sustained higher regime (~340 avg) vs older winter baseline; to capture current demand level and recent variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 8 periods.

Demand has been variable but no new sustained changepoint since prior insight. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to let OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1). This avoids overfitting to short-term noise and respects observed reliable lead time.

Recent demand (most recent weeks) centers ~300\u2013370, higher than the initial Jan baseline; to capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the last 10 demand samples to reflect current summer demand and reduce influence of early low-Jan data. This raises target base-stock to maintain service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 16-20 = 370,297,294,334,289) indicates a stable elevated mean vs earlier Jan baseline; I use a recent_N=5 sample to capture the current regime for both demand mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine set base_stock to the current short-run demand level while default L keeps pipeline short given reliable same-period arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts given ~317 weekly demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand rather than long-run January averages.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (every concluded period lists arrived units with lead_time=0) and demand has no new 3+ period sustained shift since the prior recorded insight. Pipeline + on-hand are low (44) but no overdue shipments signaled. Therefore use default lead time and demand estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages full historical sample set and the confirmed 0-period actual lead time to balance service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand (Periods 21-25) averages ~303 units with moderate variance; on-hand=72, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments observed. Historical lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to make the (1+L)\xd7mean responsive to the latest weeks (~303) instead of older Jan samples; sigma_hat also recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding overreacting to older seasonality, helping balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201326) consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=0, so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments.

No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shifts after earlier Period 4 insight. To keep policy aligned with observed behavior and let the OR engine compute demand stats from full history, use default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend uses promised lead time (0) and full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Demand history through Period 28 shows weekly mean around historical levels (no new sustained changepoint since prior carry-over insight). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0, mu_hat=default to let the backend use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast and lets it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 21\u201331) has been stable around ~250\u2013330/week. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its full-sample mean/std (scaled by 1+L) to compute base-stock and cap. This keeps parameters simple, leverages abundant history, and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline is empty.

Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201333 all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P29\u2013P33 = 229,274,254,248,405) shows a modest uptick vs long-run Jan mean; to adapt to recent pattern I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current regime while keeping L=default. This balances service (captures recent spike at P33) vs holding cost by not over-reacting to a single large spike.

To capture current recent demand while keeping responsiveness, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 observed demands). This yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean with L=0, matching current short lead-time reality and avoiding overstock from older data.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods and demand history shows no new sustained regime after the previously recorded Period 4 insight. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical data and the known zero lead time to produce a balanced base-stock that trades off service (profit=holding cost) against holding costs given equal unit profit and holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods \u2014 no evidence of delays or lost shipments \u2014 so keep L as promised. Recent demand (Periods 35-39 = 266,240,306,276,241) averages ~266; I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture current regime and avoid diluting with older seasonal data. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect current short-term variability. These settings keep the base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and confirmed lead time, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised lead time. This ensures orders replenish from low on-hand while the engine balances service vs holding costs.

No new sustained demand regime detected since prior carry-over insight; therefore use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (\u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). Defaults provide a stable base-stock target that balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=166, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. No clear recent changepoint in demand that warrants deviating from historical aggregate forecast; last concluded demand (P43) was low (143) but prior periods average around ~300. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and long-run demand, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (uses full-sample mean/variance) and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Dec) appears lower than mid-year; no sustained new changepoint detected. Profit=Holding so critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2192 base stock equals mu_hat; let OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). SKU 372860001 current on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show consistent lead_time=0 for prior orders (many periods). No recent missed arrivals. Demand history (many weekly samples across 2019) contains variability but no new sustained shift since the previously recorded Period 4 insight. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations, I use the default promised lead time (0) so the engine treats arrivals as same-period. I also use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise given stable lead-time evidence and current modest on-hand inventory. The defaults balance service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base stock from full-sample statistics and the known profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weeks (Periods 43-46) show seasonally lower demand (143,209,231,224) versus the longer-run history. On-hand=78, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically observed = 0. To avoid overstocking into low December demand while maintaining service, I keep L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower demand regime (captures last 5 weeks including the late-Nov high of 354). This reduces base-stock toward recent demand and lowers safety stock versus using the full-sample mean, balancing profit vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.
