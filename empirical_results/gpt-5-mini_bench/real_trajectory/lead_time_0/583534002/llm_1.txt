Recent 4-week average (01-14 to 02-04) = (213+219+181+125)/4 = 172 units/week; median ~200. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer delays, so assume supplier meets promised lead time (0) for planning while remaining cautious about lost shipments. Inventory/pipeline: with zero on-hand and in-transit, we would stock to meet one period of expected demand plus small safety to avoid stockout. Tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost is material but profit margin is strong, so filling expected demand is profitable. Final order logic: order approximately the recent-period demand estimate (172), rounded to an integer. This balances service level and holding cost given current downward trend and no evidence of lead-time issues.",
