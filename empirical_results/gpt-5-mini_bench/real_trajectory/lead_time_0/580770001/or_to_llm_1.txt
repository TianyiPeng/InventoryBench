{
  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed 0 (carry-over & concluded history show orders arrived same period). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 42\u201346) = 3,5,4,2,1 \u2192 recent 5-period mean = 3.0 units; demand clearly at a low regime versus older history. OR recommends 46 units based on long-run historical data and promised lead time \u2014 that would create unnecessary holding cost (holding cost = profit). With L=0 we only need to cover next-period demand; on-hand (7) already exceeds expected next-period demand (~3). Therefore order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term expected demand.",
