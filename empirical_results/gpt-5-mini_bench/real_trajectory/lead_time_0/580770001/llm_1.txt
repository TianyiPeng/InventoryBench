Historical demand (weekly samples to early Feb) averages ~153 units/week (106,133,203,165,156 => avg 152.6). Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time not yet observed; arrivals are only confirmed via conclude messages, so there is risk orders may arrive after demand. On-hand and in-transit are zero, so without ordering we'll miss likely demand this period.
