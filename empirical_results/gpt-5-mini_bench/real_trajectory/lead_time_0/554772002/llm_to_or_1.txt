Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 554772002 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. No concluded arrival history to infer lead-time changes. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~68.6 units/week. Promised lead time is used (default) because no observed arrivals exist to calculate actual lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects recent historical demand while avoiding overfitting to short noise given limited data. This approach keeps service level reasonable while limiting holding costs until we observe arriving shipments or lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history: Period1 order of 80 arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pipeline. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=68.6, std\u224812.78. Profit/holding implies high service target (q=4/(4+1)=0.8). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (recent evidence supports 0). Use mu_hat=default => (1+L)*mean = 68.6 to reflect baseline weekly demand. Use sigma_hat=default => sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 12.78 to capture observed variability. These settings produce a base-stock near mean plus safety stock tuned to profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding extra holding given zero on-hand and no in-transit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 had lead_time=0 (observed twice). No sustained demand regime shift: historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean ~68.6 and two recent periods (demand 83,136) are insufficient to declare a new regime. To be conservative and let the OR engine use its full-sample estimates, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (using observed zero lead time) while avoiding overreacting to a single high-demand week.

Daily Profit: $412.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand has risen materially versus older samples: Periods 1-3 demands = 83, 136, 103 (avg 107.33). On-hand=1, in-transit=0; lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded periods. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses avg of last 3 periods = 107.33 for (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variance. These choices raise base-stock to meet current higher demand while keeping holding cost awareness given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders in P1/P2/P3 arrived in same periods). Demand regime shift: historical mean=68.6 (2019-01 samples) -> recent mean=107.33 (P1-P3) = +56.5%, sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) confirms actual lead time = 0 and shows a sustained demand regime shift: recent mean demand \u2248107.33 over the last 3 selling periods vs historical mean 68.6 (+56%). Profit=$4, holding=$1 so service level should be raised. Set L to default (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility over same 3-period regime. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals (no additional pipeline uncertainty).

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows a sustained elevated demand regime in Periods 1-3 (avg ~107.3) followed by two cooler periods (70,50) but the elevated regime was sustained for 3 periods so I rely on that regime for forecasting. On-hand=81, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals confirm 0. Given high profit vs holding (profit=4, holding=1) we favor service (higher safety stock). Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the confirmed elevated regime (uses most recent 3-period regime). Use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility of that same regime. This balances stronger service level against holding cost while acknowledging confirmed regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical Jan mean=68.6 but recent periods (P4-P6) show higher demand (sustained ~3 periods). No overdue shipments (all recent orders arrived same period). Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since lead time confirmed as 0 in history. Use mu_hat recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (focus on P4-P6). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise base stock to match higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate tied to the same recent window.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P7 arrived same period). Recent demand across Periods 4\u20137 (70,50,77,110) averages 76.75 over 4 periods, a sustained ~4-period lower regime vs earlier P1\u2013P3 mean 107.33. I therefore keep L at promised (use default lead time=0) and set demand estimates using the recent 4-period regime to reflect the new lower mean/volatility: mu_hat -> recent_N (N=4) and sigma_hat -> recent_N (N=4). These choices align inventory to current observed demand while leveraging confirmed zero lead time to avoid over-ordering and reduce holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg decreased from 107.33 (P1-P3) to 76.75 (P4-P7) (-28.5%)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): confirmed actual lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demand regimes: P1-3 spike then P4-7 drop; last 5 concluded periods (P4-P8) show a lower sustained mean (~78 units/week). On-hand=13, in-transit=0 \u2014 avoid overstock given holding cost while maintaining high service (profit/holding implies high fill target). Set L to promised (default 0) and forecast demand using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower regime (P4-P8). Use recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower mean while keeping service level driven by profit/holding.

Recent demand (Periods 4\u20139) averages ~75.7 over 6 periods, showing the lower post-changepoint regime is sustained. To reflect the recent regime and keep inventory lean given $4 profit / $1 holding, set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most relevant 6-period demand sample, balancing service level vs holding cost.

To react quickly to current regime and capture recent surge while keeping holding cost in check, use lead time default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecast/uncertainty on the last three observed demands (captures current demand level and variance). This balances service for the recent spike without over-committing inventory for older data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and recent demand has been elevated and more volatile vs. Jan baseline; last 5 demand samples (Periods 8-12 = 85,62,156,105,95) have mean ~100.6 and noticeable variability. I keep L as default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher mean and variance so the OR backend will raise the base-stock target and the cap to better meet recent demand while controlling holding costs.

On-hand=40, in-transit=0; recent demand has moderated versus early spikes. I detect a stable recent regime over the last ~6 periods (Periods 8-13 demand: 85,62,156,105,95,90) so I use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current demand pattern. This balances service (capture recent variability) against holding cost given limited pipeline.

To reflect the latest demand regime I use recent_N (last 7 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across (1+L) weeks using the most recent pattern; L kept as default (promised=0) consistent with observed arrivals. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by letting the backend compute z from profit=4 and holding=1.

Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 5 demands (P14-P18) average \u224899.8 units/week. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (reduces influence of older spikes) so base-stock targets ~100 units. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These settings keep orders responsive (low lead time) while limiting excess holding cost given current on-hand inventory of 45.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 17-19 = 94, 69, 101) suggests current regime centers near ~88 units/week; to capture this short-run pattern while keeping responsiveness, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (L=0 so mu_hat \u2248 mean of last 3). Demand volatility is estimated from the same recent window, so set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3. These choices keep service capability aligned to the most recent demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201320) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand history shows earlier regime shifts captured in carry-over insights but no new sustained change in the most recent periods. Given confirmed same-day arrivals and no strong recent demand regime change, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs. holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Recent demand (Periods 19-21 = 101, 111, 114) is above older averages; I use a short recent window to capture the current higher demand regime. Set L to default (promised = 0).

On-hand=21, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to anchor mu_hat to the most recent stable regime (captures weeks with demands 101,111,114,94 \u2192 mean \u2248105) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward stocking for current observed demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $4 (moderate service targeting).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand has softened versus early-period spike; last 5 observed demands (Periods 19-23) = [101,111,114,94,64], so I use a recent_N forecast to capture current regime. Using L=default (promised 0) keeps arrivals same-period as observed. mu_hat recent_N (N=5) targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 demands; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) uses the corresponding recent volatility. This balances service (reflecting recent demand ~97 units) against holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-29. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in prior concludes), so use default promised L=0. Recent demand (Periods 20-24 = 111,114,94,64,79) averages ~92.4 \u2014 this is a noticeable uptick vs the earlier lower regime (76.75) and is sustained for 5 periods, so forecast demand using the last 5 samples to capture current regime. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 weeks; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory given observed volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P25 all arrived same period). Recent demand (last 4 concluded periods P22\u2013P25: 94,64,79,54) has averaged ~72.75; no new sustained regime shift. Use observed lead time (calculate) to ensure backend treats L=0. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the most recent demand level and volatility while keeping (1+L) scaling consistent. This keeps target base stock responsive to current lower demand and limits holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs early spikes; to be responsive to the latest weeks I use a recent window for demand estimate. Chosen N=5 (last 5 demand samples) balances recency and sample size (>=3) to capture current regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 5 samples; this lowers exposure to obsolete high means while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed earlier) and no new sustained demand regime change since Period 8. On-hand=10, in-transit=0 so availability is low vs. recent weekly sales (recent weeks: 54,78,77). To target a high service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) while reacting to recent demand, I use recent_N demand estimates over the last 7 weeks to capture the latest regime without over-reacting to single-week noise. Lead time set to default (promised = 0) consistent with confirmed observations. Sigma also from recent 7-week sample to reflect current volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historically confirmed actual L=0. Recent demand (Periods 26-28) = [78,77,107], recent mean=87.33 over 3 periods, showing an uptick vs the prior regime mean 76.75. To react quickly to the most recent demand regime while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed zero lead time, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the latest regime (short window due to recent shift evident in last 3 periods). This raises the backend base-stock to reflect the recent demand increase while sigma_hat based on recent volatility tightens safety stock to recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand uptick starting Period 26: avg (P26-P28)=87.33 vs prior regime avg 76.75 (+14.0%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand regime: uptick starting P26 sustained through P28\u2013P29; to capture the most recent regime I use recent_N with N=3 (focus on last 3 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the current higher short-run demand while keeping volatility estimate responsive. This balances high service target (profit/holding -> q=0.8) against holding cost given modest on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time=0; no missed shipments. Recent demand has shifted several times; most recent 3-5 weeks show lower/variable demand compared to earlier regimes. I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to make the forecast responsive to the latest demand regime while smoothing short noise. For sigma_hat I use default so backend applies full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). These choices keep order targets responsive to recent lower demand and limit excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 29-31 = 70,47,30) shows a sharp, sustained drop vs prior short-run (P26-28 avg=87.33). Lead time historically confirmed 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). To adapt quickly to the new low-demand regime I use L=default (promised=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 3 periods (recent_N N=3) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the newest regime data, which reduces target base-stock and inventory holding while preserving a high service quantile given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg decreased from 87.33 (P26-P28) to 49.0 (P29-P31) (-43.9%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 historically (orders consistently arrived same period). Recent demand has dropped: Periods 30-32 demands = 47, 30, 26 (mean 34.33), indicating a new lower regime. On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 we must cover current-period demand after decision. I choose L=default to use promised (observed) lead time = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the latest confirmed low-demand regime (N=3 is the regime length), so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 3 samples. This reduces target base-stock and caps ordering to avoid excess holding given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand has been in the lower recent regime since Period 29 (demands P29-P33 = 70,47,30,26,46; recent low-average sustained >=5 periods). To reflect the current low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=5). L uses default (promised lead time 0) consistent with observed arrivals. This biases orders toward the recent lower mean and observed volatility, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current demand level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has been 0 (many concluded arrivals same period). Recent demand has dropped: Periods 32-34 demands = 26, 46, 29 (avg=33.67 over last 3). Prior confirmed regime (Periods 29-31) avg=49.0. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm continued 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime (keeps (1+L) scaling consistent and tightens safety stock). This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given low recent demand and holding cost=$1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 32: avg (P32-P34)=33.67 vs prior regime avg 49.0 (P29-P31) = -31.3%, sustained 3 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to anchor forecast to the most recent low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent observed volatility. These params bias the OR backend toward a lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained low-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders in past periods arrived same period). Recent demand has been low and stable (Period 34-36 demands = 29,25,22); I treat this as the current regime. To match observed regime I set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the 1-period forecast based on the most recent low-demand samples, avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4. No overdue shipments observed and no new sustained pattern beyond the recorded carry-over insights.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 32 (P32\u2013P37 demands = [26,46,29,25,22,17], regime length=6). To reflect the recent low-demand regime and minimize holding cost while preserving service, I use recent_N over the last 6 periods for both demand mean and volatility; keep lead time as promised (default=0).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled into the low regime detected earlier (Period 32 onward). Last 7 concluded periods (P32-P38) show consistently lower demand vs prior regimes; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (captures sustained drop since P32). This tightens forecast and reduces excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; keep L as promised (default=0). Demand has settled into a low recent regime (last weeks: P35-P39 demand = 25,22,17,26,7). To reflect the recent low mean and recent volatility I use recent_N on the last 5 samples for both demand mean and std ((1+L) factor =1 since L=0). These parameters bias the OR backend toward lower replenishment (reducing holding cost) while still covering one-week demand variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been low (last 5 concluded demands: 22,17,26,7,13) so I use a short-window estimate to capture current low regime and reduce holding cost. Set L=default to trust promised 0 (supported by consistent concluded 0 lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low and consistent (P32\u2013P41 mean \u224823.1), so use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid legacy higher-demand regimes inflating forecast. No new evidence contradicts confirmed lead time=0, so keep promised lead time. Chosen: L=default to respect promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) to target the last 10 weeks' low regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given current low demand and minimal pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). SKU 554772002 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201342) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (P40=13, P41=20, P42=33) shows short-term variability but not a clear, sustained regime shift (need \u22653 periods of consistent change beyond noise). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics while avoiding overfitting to a small recent blip, I select the promised/default lead time and let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample estimates) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent weeks show a sustained low-demand regime (last 3 concluded demands: P41=20, P42=32, P43=8 \u2192 mean \u224820.0), consistent with prior downward regime shifts. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use L=default (promised 0) and set demand estimates to recent_N with N=3 to capture the current low regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use default promised lead time. Recent demand has declined substantially since Period 32 (recent weeks showing very low weekly sales: P43=8, P44=10). To bias forecast toward these recent low demands while still allowing smoothing, set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.3) so the backend emphasizes recent samples but retains some history. Use a recent_N estimate for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current low-volatility regime. These choices reduce ordering given high on-hand stock and low recent demand, lowering holding costs while preserving service level under promised L=0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand is very low (Periods 43-45 demand = 8,10,14; recent mean \u224810.67) and on-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. To avoid unnecessary holding cost given large on-hand, keep promised lead time (default). Forecast demand with recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low regime; use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent low variability. This keeps base-stock small (matching current low demand) while respecting high service-level q=0.8 from profit/holding costs, and prevents overstocking given current 70 units on hand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 repeatedly. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 32 (many weeks of low weekly demand; recent demands include P32-P46). To avoid overstock while covering immediate demand, keep L as promised (default). Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime (captures P32\u2013P46 behavior). Use recent_N (N=15) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-variance periods. These choices prioritize lower target base stock consistent with sustained low demand while still accounting for recent variability.
