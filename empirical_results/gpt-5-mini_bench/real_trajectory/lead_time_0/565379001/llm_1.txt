Product is a basic women's jersey vest\u2014no strong seasonal spike tied to mid-February; demand likely stable moving from winter to spring. No major retail event in the immediate week that would drastically change demand for this SKU. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) are: 269, 299, 301, 333, 292. Mean \u2248 299 units/week, moderate variability (range 64). No sustained upward or downward shift visible in these 5 samples. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Promised lead time = 0, but no concluded arrivals history to confirm actual lead time; actual lead time unknown. No in-transit inventory and no prior arrivals to infer delays. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1), so carrying extra inventory is expensive; avoid overstocking. e) Final order logic: Aim to cover expected demand for the current period only with minimal safety stock given lead time uncertainty and high holding cost. Use historical mean \u2248300 units. Place an order of 300 units to meet this period's expected demand while limiting holding exposure.",
