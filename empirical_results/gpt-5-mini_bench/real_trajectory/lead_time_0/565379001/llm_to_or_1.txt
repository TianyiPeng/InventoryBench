Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable weekly demand around mean ~299 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no lead-time evidence yet. Use promised lead time (default=0) and default demand estimates based on all samples to let OR backend compute base_stock and cap from full-sample mean/SD. This balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Period 1 order (299) arrived in Period 1 \u2192 observed lead_time=0. Historical demand samples mean \u2248299. With equal profit and holding cost, use observed lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This yields conservative replenishment matching recent demand while avoiding extra holding.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order: ordered P1, arrived P1)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a jump (Period1=273, Period2=506) vs historical ~290\u2013330. Lead time previously confirmed as 0; no new evidence to change it. To be responsive to the recent upward demand while accounting for volatility, set L to promised (default 0), and base demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 3 periods to capture the recent spike without overreacting to a single large week. This balances service (avoid stockouts given zero inventory) against holding cost.

Daily Profit: $329.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1-P3 arrived same period). On-hand=28, in-transit=0; last three period demands = [273, 506, 329] showing a transient spike in P2 but overall elevated recent demand. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent demand regime (captures the P2 spike and P3 recovery) so the OR backend targets a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Daily Profit: $298.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized demand has been elevated vs the older samples (last 4 demands: 273, 506, 329, 298; mean=351.5). On-hand=72, in-transit=0 and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock target reflects the higher short-term mean while keeping variability estimate recent. This raises order targets to protect service with minimal extra holding given holding cost equals profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead times = 0 each concluded period) and stable weekly demand (recent demands: 273,506,329,298,275). On-hand=77, in-transit=0 \u2014 no outstanding arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms observed lead time=0 from history. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). This avoids overreacting to the single high spike and leverages full history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0). Demand recent sequence (Periods 1-6) = [273,506,329,298,275,293]; no sustained new regime beyond normal variability. Use promised/default lead time to keep orders arriving same period. Set demand forecast using recent_N=6 to capture latest demand mix (including one high spike) and set sigma using recent_N=6 to reflect recent variability. This balances service (captures recent spike) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand weekly around ~300 with occasional spikes to ~340. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover this period's demand plus safety. Lead time confirmed as 0 from concluded arrivals; therefore use an L estimate based on observed lead times. Use default demand forecast based on full sample mean scaled by (1+L) so the OR engine computes base stock from historical mean/variance. With profit=holding ($1/$1) service-level target is ~50%; default mu/sigma lets OR backend balance fill rate vs holding costs given observed stable regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent realized weekly demand shows elevated stable mean (~298\u2013340 in last 5 weeks) and occasional spikes (Period 2). Lead-time history (concluded messages) consistently shows 0 periods. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set lead time to the observed average (calculate=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks where demand regime is stable (Periods 4\u20138). Using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine size orders to recent demand and recent volatility rather than older winter samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows frequent same-period arrivals and weekly demand samples averaging ~299 (historical samples). Current on-hand=98, in-transit=0 \u2014 no shipments expected. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full-sample stability given no sustained regime change and balances fill-rate vs holding cost with the OR engine's service-level formula.

All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Profit and holding cost are equal, so use default forecasting (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample). This keeps orders aligned with observed demand and leverages confirmed 0-period lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Demand history shows recent weekly demands varying ~209\u2013340 with mean near ~298. Given confirmed 0-period lead time and no clear regime shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (fast replenishment) vs holding cost without overreacting to recent variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P12 all arrived same period) so use calculated lead time. Demand has been stable across periods (no sustained regime shift); use default demand and volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (z* at q=0.5 implies median stocking) against holding cost given profit=holding.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=157, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show demand cooling (P13 demand=138) but no sustained regime change; lead time was previously confirmed as 0. I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/std (scaled by 1+L=1). This keeps decisions grounded in long-run demand while avoiding overfitting to the one-week dip; with zero in-transit, orders will directly replenish on-hand in the same period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has dropped from ~300s in Feb/Mar to ~200s in Apr/May (last 5 concluded demands: 234,230,203,138,202; mean ~201). On-hand=84, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier), so use default promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures latest 5 concluded demand samples and reduces weight of the earlier high-demand weeks). This will lower the base-stock and cap, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Demand samples (weeks in history) show no sustained regime change requiring adjustment. Given profit=holding, service-level q=0.5 (z*=0) so base stock equals mu_hat; use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This keeps parameters anchored to full-sample demand and leverages confirmed L=0 while avoiding overreaction to recent variability.

Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 earlier and arrivals have been same-period, so use default L to keep backend assumption. To avoid overstock given high on-hand and lower recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (recent_N, N=5) so the base-stock targets reflect the lower recent mean and volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Historical concluded data (P1\u2013P18) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and weekly demands ranging ~92\u2013506 with recent lower demand (last 6 weeks mostly 92\u2013181). On-hand=65, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Because actual lead time is confirmed 0 and there is no clear sustained regime shift, use default lead time and demand statistics so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean and variance. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 => z=0).

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has trended down from spring peaks to ~100-200 units/week (see history); on-hand=134, in-transit=0 so current stock covers roughly one week of recent demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable confirmed 0 lead time and no new evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1-20) consistently show actual lead time = 0; no recent sustained demand regime shift detected (demand has trended lower since spring but not 3+ period sustained upward). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so a balanced service level is appropriate. Using default lead time and demand estimators lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which is conservative given no new sustained pattern and zero pipeline to cover upcoming demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=156, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 2) and no recent lost shipments. Demand history (seed samples mean \u2248298.8) shows no sustained regime shift; current recent demands have declined vs early-year peak but not persistently enough to change regime. Profit=Holding, so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) and base_stock equals mu_hat. I choose L=default (use promised 0). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, providing a neutral baseline that balances fill rate and holding cost given equal profit/holding and confirmed 0 lead time. This avoids overreacting to recent short-term dips while keeping inventory sufficient for expected weekly demand.

Recent demand has settled lower vs earlier periods; last 5 concluded demands = [92,122,114,89,74], indicating a new lower regime (mean ~98). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use lead time = default (promised 0 confirmed), and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock on the current lower mean and observed volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent realized demand has fallen from ~300/wk (winter) to ~50\u2013180/wk (summer); last 10 concluded demands (P15\u2013P24) average ~105 units. On-hand=48, in-transit=0 so current stock is well below a (1+L)-period demand at recent rates. Lead-time history is consistently 0 periods. Therefore: set L using observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained downward summer demand regime (10 recent samples chosen because the regime change appears sustained across ~10 periods). These parameters steer the OR backend to size base-stock around current lower summer demand while reflecting reduced volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand has moderated vs early-year peaks but no sustained regime shift (fluctuations only). With profit=holding, target service quantile q=0.5 so no upside safety stock needed. Use promised/default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, preserving stability and avoiding overreaction to recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (confirmed in prior carry-over). Recent demand has fallen vs early-year peaks but no sustained regime shift of 3+ periods beyond expected seasonality. On-hand=180, in-transit=0; with lead time 0 we should target (1+L)-period coverage based on full-sample stats. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from all historical samples, trading service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks to low summer weekly sales (~30\u2013180 range recently) and on-hand is healthy (180) with zero in-transit. Historical concluded lead-times consistently show arrivals same period (lead_time=0). No overdue shipments observed. To avoid unnecessary holding cost while preserving service, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from observed demand history. This keeps orders aligned to long-run demand while relying on confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=180, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised lead time. Demand has been substantially lower since early July (Period 22 onward: weekly demand samples = [74,53,64,37,35,29,24], recent mean ~45 units) \u2014 a clear, sustained downshift from earlier months. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=7 (captures the new lower regime). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=7 to reflect reduced recent variability.

On-hand (168) covers several weeks of current low demand; no overdue shipments. Using default lead time keeps promised L=0 (supported by sustained evidence). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, balancing service level vs. holding cost without overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has fallen markedly vs early-2019 (weekly demand ~200\u2013300 Jan\u2013Apr, then mostly <100 since May). On-hand=177, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I keep L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime starting around Period 13 (May) \u2014 N=20 captures the most recent ~20 weeks of the new regime so the OR backend will lower target base stock and reduce holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=164, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show same-period arrivals (lead time=0), and recent weekly demand has trended lower (many weeks with demand <100). With profit=holding ($1/$1) the service-level tradeoff is symmetric; use defaults so the OR backend computes L=promised(0) and (1+L)-scaled mean/std from full sample history, letting the engine set base-stock while avoiding manual over/under adjustment given no new sustained regime change.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent samples to reflect the lower regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the latest regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Historical concluded data shows a clear, sustained drop in weekly demand beginning at Period 23. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier). On-hand=165, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. the recent low demand regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the new low regime (Periods 23\u201333 avg demand \u224827.4 units; (1+L) multiplier =1). Sigma set recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a much lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained lower demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg demand before P23 = 217.2 (Periods 1\u201322), avg demand P23\u2013P33 = 27.4 (\u221287%), sustained for 11 periods

Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the low-demand regime (use N=12 covering Periods 23\u201334).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 23: weekly demand fell sharply from ~217 (P1\u2013P22) to low single-digits/teens thereafter (P23\u2013P35). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals equal orders each period when ordered). On-hand =143, in-transit=0, recent demands (P23\u2013P35) are low and steady (~11/week most recent). I set L=default to trust promised lead time 0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). For forecasting I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change low-demand regime; regime length P23\u2013P35 = 13 periods so N=13. This keeps the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std focused on recent low demand, avoiding overstock from pre-change high demand samples and balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand regime since Period 23 is low and stable (~27.4 units/week); on-hand=133, in-transit=0 so coverage is ~4.8 weeks. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I target the low-demand regime using recent_N with N=14 (Periods 23\u201336) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of that regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders modest (matches lower demand) and avoids excess holding costs while preserving service given current inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 23 (sustained drop). Lead-time history (concluded messages) consistently shows arrivals same period as orders \u2192 actual LT = 0. To focus forecast on the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 15 post-changepoint samples (Periods 23\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility aligned with current lower demand and avoids over-ordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 23 (P1\u2013P22 mean=217.2, P23\u2013P38 mean\u224827.4 then dropping to ~11\u201313 in most recent weeks). On-hand=110, in-transit=0; with confirmed same-period fulfillment historically (lead time observed 0) I keep L as default (promised). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the sustained low-demand regime: use N=16 (Periods 23\u201338) \u2014 N chosen = min(regime_length,20)=16. This reduces forecasted review+lead demand and lowers orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the low post-change regime since Period 23 (sustained ~11\u201317 periods with mean \u224827\u2192~11 recently). On-hand=104, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs. current low weekly demand (\u224810\u201312 most recent weeks). Lead time historically confirmed as 0; use promised lead time to keep arrivals same-period. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-change regime (Periods 23\u201339) so the OR engine targets a much lower base-stock and avoids excess holding cost. Sigma also estimated from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility. These parameters reduce ordering while maintaining service given the sustained lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-94.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 23 (sustained drop: avg before P23 = 217.2 vs P23\u2013P33 = 27.4, and low demands continue through P40). On-hand = 99, in-transit = 0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded messages consistently show lead_time = 0, so use default lead time. To match the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime data (Periods 23\u201340). Regime length = 18 periods, so recent_N with N=18 captures current mean/volatility and prevents overordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history (Periods 23\u201341) shows a sustained low-demand regime after the sharp drop at P23 (avg before P23 = 217.2 vs avg P23\u2013P33 = 27.4 and continuing low demand through P41). On-hand = 98, in-transit = 0; no delayed/lost arrivals observed recently and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime; regime length since changepoint is 19 periods so N=19 (N selection: N = min(regime_length,20) = 19, \u22653). This keeps the OR base-stock tied to the current low mean and measured volatility, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining adequate service for the new regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Item 565379001 has on-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (orders that arrived indicate same-period arrival). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 23 (sustained ~11+ periods). No shipments are overdue. To avoid unnecessary holding cost given profit=holding cost, use the backend defaults: keep promised lead time (default) and let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples so the OR engine balances service vs holding cost using full history while respecting confirmed L=0.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=140, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 23 (P23\u2013P43 = 21 periods). Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in history, so use default lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 (captures most of the sustained low-demand regime while respecting the N cap) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest regime and avoid overweighting older high-demand periods. This keeps base-stock aligned with current low demand and avoids excess holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=138, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 23 with much lower weekly demand; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking while meeting low recent demand, keep L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates, focused on the low-demand regime: choose N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the most recent 20 weeks of the low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a conservative base stock matching current low demand and reduced volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 23 (sustained ~11/week or lower). On-hand=115, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory already covers many weeks of current low demand so ordering should be conservative. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent data to reflect the low regime: choose mu_hat recent_N with N=12 (Periods 34\u201345) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current low weekly demand. For uncertainty use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent variance. These parameters keep the OR base-stock aligned with the new low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 23 (avg ~27.4) lasting 24 periods; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. On-hand=103, in-transit=0. To avoid overstocking given Profit=Holding ($1) and the long-lived low-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained regime while capping at 20). This biases orders toward recent low demand, reducing holding cost risk while maintaining service.
