Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean = 85.2 units/week and std \u2248 23.65. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence; no sustained demand regime change detected. Promised lead time used (default=0). Using default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast and caps intact while avoiding overreaction to limited 5-sample noise. This balances service level (cover typical weekly demand \u224885 units) against low holding cost ($1/unit) and reasonable profit ($19/unit).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (129) arrived with lead_time=0 and stockout occurred (demand 136, sold 129). No sustained changepoint evidence (only one recent arrival and one high-demand period). Use promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend leverages full historical samples to compute base_stock and caps; this balances service (captures historical variability including the recent sale) versus holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Recent observed demands: Period1=136, Period2=103; earlier weekly samples include 116 (2019-02-04). Two consecutive high-demand periods suggest a modest upward shift but not yet 3+ periods of evidence. Actual lead times observed in concludes = 0 periods (P1 and P2), so use promised lead time. To capture recent uplift while being conservative, set demand estimate using the most recent 3 samples (136,103,116) and match sigma to recent variability (N=3). This balances service level (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts) against low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1774.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows demand 136,103,96 and earlier sample series from Jan (83,67,107,53,116). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. All three recent orders arrived same period (lead_time observed=0). I choose default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses promised L and full-sample statistics; this leverages confirmed same-period arrivals while letting backend compute base_stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 arrived P2; P3 arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1540.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed). Historical weekly demand samples (83,67,107,53,116) have mean \u224885 and moderate variability. On-hand=56, in-transit=0; with L=0 the OR engine expects (1+L)\xd7mean demand \u224885 for the review+lead period, so on-hand is below the expected coverage and replenishment is appropriate. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std to compute base-stock and the capped order amount.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1624.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~101 units (periods 1-5 demands: 136,103,96,84,88) with no evidence of lead-time issues (confirmed LT=0 in prior insight). On-hand=48, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low relative to a ~101/week demand. I set L to default (promised 0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to target the most recent demand regime (captures the higher recent weekly demand vs older historical Jan samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings bias orders toward meeting current weekly demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock based on recent mean/volatility and the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1544.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Recent concluded weekly demands stable (periods 2-6 demand ~103,96,84,88,84) and prior samples (Jan) give overall mean ~85.2. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full historical mean/SD (1+L multiplier) to compute base stock; this balances service (stable weekly demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows weekly variability (past demands: 136,103,96,84,88,84,160 plus earlier samples). Period 7 had a one-off spike to 160 but not a sustained regime shift (only one week), and lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from the full sample set. This keeps orders responsive to observed weekly demand while avoiding overfitting to the single spike and balances service level vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and higher unit profit ($19).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=50, in-transit=0; lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in prior conclude messages. Recent demand shows a one-time spike (160 in Period 7) but otherwise steady ~80-100. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the modest upward shift without overreacting to the single large spike. Volatility use default.

Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand has varied (historical samples and recent periods show demands ~82\u2013160, no sustained regime shift). On-hand=67, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I use default lead time (promised 0). I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, preserving robustness given no confirmed demand regime change and confirmed L=0. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (last 10 periods): [136,103,96,84,88,84,160,97,82,51]. Lead time historically observed = 0 for all concluded orders; use calculate to reflect confirmed LT=0. No sustained demand regime shift (recent high at P7 then drop at P10 is not sustained), so base demand on the most recent 10 samples to capture recent variability. mu_hat set via recent_N (N=10) -> backend will compute (1+L)*mean of these 10 demands. sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=10) -> backend will compute sqrt(1+L)*std of these 10 demands. This balances high service level implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95) while using recent data to avoid overreacting to a single low week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in Period 4 and every concluded period since), stable weekly demand with samples from Feb\u2013early Feb provided and recent demands between 51\u2013160 (mean trending moderate). On-hand=95, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I use default lead time (promised=0) since concluded history confirms 0. I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0) and demand varying roughly 50\u2013160 with recent weeks 51\u201395 and current on-hand=52, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments. I select L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (supported by sustained past evidence). I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and mixed variability. Keeping defaults avoids overfitting short blips and leverages full history for the base-stock calculation.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed in prior insight) and stable weekly demand samples across history. To let the OR engine use full sample history and the confirmed lead time, I select default methods so base_stock uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). No sustained demand regime change detected; recent weeks' demand are similar to historical samples. Use default lead time (promised 0) so OR backend assumes L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable baseline that balances service level and holding cost given no strong evidence to alter forecasts.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). SKU 658030011 has on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-15) consistently show actual lead time = 0 with timely arrivals and no lost shipments. Demand has exhibited moderate week-to-week variability but no sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given current stable demand and no overdue shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=69, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has been slightly below historical mean; last 5 demand observations (Periods 12-16: 89,73,71,74,65) show a stable recent regime (mean ~74.4). To keep service high with low holding cost, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, capturing the recent downward shift while preserving responsiveness given same-period arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201317 arrivals same-period). Recent demand has softened versus early-sample weeks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [73,71,74,65,53], mean \u224867.2. I set L by calculation to formally capture observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to make mu_hat reflect the most recent regime (captures the recent downward shift) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the high profit/low holding ratio implies a high service level\u2014using recent stats avoids overstock from older higher-demand weeks. No overdue shipments observed.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in all concluded periods), so use observed lead time. Demand history appears stable around prior samples; no sustained regime shift detected. To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and long-run sample stats, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using complete history) against holding cost given current modest on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201319 arrivals matched orders), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has softened vs earlier weeks: last 5 concluded demands = [53,55,38,? wait\u2014use Periods 15\u201319 actual demands]: Periods 15\u201319 demands = [74,65,53,55,38] showing a downward shift (mean of last 5 = 57). To react to the recent lower regime while retaining responsiveness given lead time=0, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent regime without overfitting). This reduces target base stock relative to long-run mean and limits holding cost while preserving service. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change.

No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift; recent weeks show lower demand but not sustained change. Use default lead time to match promised 0 and let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times uniformly 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand has been variable but no sustained regime change in last 3+ periods; inventory is moderate relative to recent weeks. Use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR engine applies its full-sample mean/variance (keeps service while controlling holding cost).

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over insight). Demand history shows stable weekly sales without a recent sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute base-stock ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This leverages the confirmed LT=0 and avoids overfitting short-term noise, balancing service (profit=$19) against holding cost ($1).

Given stable weekly demand history and confirmed lead time=0, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (weeks shown) display stable behavior with confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Profit=$19, holding=$1 -> high service target (q\u22480.95). I choose default lead time (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals) and default demand estimators so backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps base-stock aligned with long-run observed demand while the high profit/holding ratio drives a higher z for service; using defaults avoids overfitting short recent swings and handles no in-transit inventory/missing-shipment risk conservatively.

LLM Rationale:

Profit $19 vs holding $1 yields a high critical ratio (service emphasis). I use default lead time to trust promised L=0 and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting it set base-stock and cap consistent with high service objective while accounting for observed variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201330) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period as orders). Recent demand spikes (Period 30 demand=130) occur but are within historical variability. Profit/holding ratio implies a high critical fractile (q\u22480.95) so backend will target high service levels. Given consistent LT=0 and no sustained regime change in demand, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine apply its capped policy to balance fill rate vs. holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-31) consistently show arrivals same period as orders; carry-over previously confirmed lead time=0. Recent demand varies around ~80-100 weekly with occasional spikes; no sustained regime change detected. To let the OR engine use its full-sample estimates and the promised lead time, set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full-history stats) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; recent weeks (P25\u2013P32) show elevated demand (~72,72,98,94,78,130,124,123) vs earlier periods. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To focus the policy on the recent higher demand regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates with N=8 (last 8 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the current higher mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This increases the base_stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Demand shows one large spike in Period 33 (230) but not a sustained regime change. No overdue shipments detected. Use promised lead time (default L=0).

Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). SKU 658030011 has on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0. Given stable lead-time evidence and available historical demand samples, use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service level (uses full-sample mean) against holding cost using the backend's q-based z*.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; holding cost low vs profit (19 vs 1). Historical concluded lead times confirm same-period arrivals (lead time = 0). Recent demand (Periods 34-38 = 117,119,118,115,150) shows a new, slightly-elevated stable regime vs earlier long-run mean, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture current level while keeping safety stock tight. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. L kept at default (promised lead time = 0) given confirmed 0 LT in history. This balances service (cover current higher weekly demand) against holding cost given very low inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows stable same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 in prior carry-over), varied weekly demand with several high weeks (e.g., P33=230) but overall historical samples available. On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use default lead time (promised LT=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history\u2014this leverages all data for a balanced service level given profit=$19 vs holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent weeks (Oct\u2013Nov) show elevated and more volatile demand, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 weeks, balancing higher service level for upcoming retail season against holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201341) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period as orders). Inventory is healthy vs recent weekly demands but no pipeline coverage for this period. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full demand history; this leverages the long sample series and keeps the base-stock policy aligned with observed zero lead time while balancing the high profit (q\u22480.95) against low holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over), no sustained demand regime shift in the last 3+ periods (recent demands: 97,92,95,109). Use promised/confirmed L=0 and population-wide demand statistics so OR backend computes base-stock and caps with full sample mean/std. This keeps service level appropriate while avoiding unnecessary holding given modest on-hand inventory and stable recent demand.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201343) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has varied but no sustained new regime detected. I retain promised lead time (use backend default) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample history so it balances profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). This avoids overfitting to recent noise while leveraging confirmed lead time=0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (Period 4 conclude). Recent weeks (Periods 37\u201344) show a new demand regime with mixed but lower recent weekly demand (115,150,97,92,95,109,44,77); I therefore use a recent-window forecast so the OR engine reacts to the latest seasonality around early Dec. With profit >> holding cost we favor service (cover ~1 week demand) while avoiding excess inventory given already 75 on-hand.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 0-period lead time (Period 1\u201346 arrivals all indicate lead_time=0); recent demand samples (weekly) show stable mean with occasional spikes (e.g., Periods 33, 30). No evidence of lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level driven by profit/holding cost while avoiding manual over-adjustment for short-lived spikes.
