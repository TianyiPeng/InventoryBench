Lead-time inference: no concluded arrivals history yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 0; cannot assume a lost shipment. Demand assessment: recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (last three weeks: 8 \u2192 17 \u2192 27), suggesting the true current-period mean is above the 5-sample average. Risk trade-offs: profit=$1 and holding=$1 so overstocking is costly (critical fractile 0.5), but ordering too little risks stockouts when demand appears to be accelerating. Decision: moderately increase above OR to provide buffer for the observed upward trend while limiting holding cost exposure. I choose 15 units (\u2248 +36% vs OR) to better cover likely demand this week (recent single-week demand peaked at 27) without creating excessive ending inventory if trend does not persist.

Demand analysis: recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime (carry-over notes recent avg \u2248135 and multiple large weekly demands: P17 demand=237, P18 demand=282). With profit=holding ($1=$1) the OR fractile is 0.5 (no safety bias), but given the clear regime shift and high realized demands last two periods, I target enough stock to avoid stockouts rather than follow OR's lower capped recommendation (OR=109). Strategy: order 200 units to cover expected high single-period demand (buffering above the recent high 282 is costly; 200 balances avoiding stockouts vs holding cost). This uses confirmed lead time 0 so units will arrive in Period 19 and be available to satisfy demand in Period 19.
