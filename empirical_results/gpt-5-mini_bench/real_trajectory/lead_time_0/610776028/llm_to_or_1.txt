Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 8,17,27). No concluded arrivals exist so use promised lead time. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N to capture the new higher regime (N=3 covering 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to meet the sustained uptick while avoiding relying on older zero-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent avg = 17.33 units/week (samples 8,17,27) vs prior avg = 0 (2019-01-07,01-14); sustained for 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: baseline samples [0,0,8,17,27] (mean=10.4) and carry-over indicates a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent samples 8,17,27 mean=17.33). Period 1 conclude shows an arrival with lead_time=0 and heavy unmet demand (sold 18 of 77), so no evidence yet of a sustained further jump. I keep L at promised/default (observed lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed regime of higher demand (8,17,27) giving (1+L)*mean focused on the new regime. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to better cover the higher regime while keeping variance estimation focused on recent behavior to avoid overstock from older zero-demand periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 but recent demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 (samples 8,17,27). Past concluded orders showed lead_time=0 (P1 and P2 arrivals). I set L=default (promised 0) because observed lead times match promise. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime (3 samples: 8,17,27), which will raise the base-stock forecast while keeping variability aligned to the new regime. This balances service (avoid lost sales given zero inventory) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 => moderate safety stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has jumped sharply: Periods 1-3 demands = 77, 143, 176 (avg 132). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage; shipments to date have arrived with 0 lead time. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (regime length=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the last 3 samples. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a much higher base stock to avoid stockouts under the sustained elevated demand while keeping variance estimation tied to the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11): recent avg = 132 units/week (Periods 1-3 demands 77,143,176) vs prior avg = 17.33 (2019-01-21..02-04); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent history shows four consecutive same-period arrivals (orders in P1-P4 arrived in P1-P4) indicating actual lead time = 0. Demand has shifted to a higher regime over the last 3 demand samples: [77,143,176], mean=132. To match observed regime and keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L by calculating observed lead times, set mu_hat using recent 3-sample mean (1+L)*mean =132, and set sigma_hat from recent 3-sample volatility to reflect current variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime (recent demands: 176,143,129; prior spike series 77,143,176). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (focus on the last three weeks to reflect current demand level and variability). This balances service (higher mean) vs holding cost by targeting the most recent regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a clear sustained demand regime since 2019-02-11: recent demands (Periods 4-6) = [143,129,138], recent mean = 136.67. To reflect the new higher-demand regime and avoid stockouts, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the last 3 high-demand periods; this biases ordering toward meeting elevated demand while keeping volatility estimate localized to the recent regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), and recent demand is high and variable (last 5 demands: 176,143,129,138,200; mean\u2248157). To meet elevated recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 service-level tradeoff moderate), set lead time by observed history and forecast using the last 5 samples to capture the current regime. L chosen as calculate to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most recent regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (periods 1-8 demands = 77,143,176,143,129,138,200,194) with sustained elevated mean; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Lead time confirmed as 0 in concluded history, so set L via calculate (avg observed LT=0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 (regime length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples, capturing the current high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the recent high weekly demand while sigma from recent samples keeps safety stock appropriate given high variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 1-9 demands: 77,143,176,143,129,138,200,194,184) vs prior low demand in Jan. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must target the recent high-demand level. Lead time has been confirmed 0 in concluded history. I therefore use L=default (promised=0) and set demand estimates using recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility; this biases orders toward meeting current weekly demand while the OR backend will compute safety stock from these inputs.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use default (promised) L=0. Forecast demand using recent data to capture the sustained higher regime: set mu_hat based on the last 6 observed periods. Use sigma_hat based on the same 6 recent samples to reflect current volatility. These choices yield a base-stock targeting service for the higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-02-11 (periods 1\u201311 with demands: 77,143,176,143,129,138,200,194,184,130,137); this is 11 recent samples and represents the current demand level and volatility. Use recent_N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the elevated regime while capping orders via its cap parameter.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent zero actual lead time; no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has been volatile with a drop in the last week (72) but not yet a sustained regime shift. I keep L as promised (default). To reflect recent demand patterns and reduce exposure to the single low week, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 weeks and volatility from those weeks, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Recent demand has dropped (Periods 11-13 demands = 137, 72, 46), indicating a new lower regime; to avoid excess holding I use a short recent window (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the recent slowdown.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has moderated versus the earlier peak: last 3 demands = [72,46,35] and on-hand=63, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the most recent regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to anchor forecast to the last 3 weeks' lower demand and reduce overstock risk. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the recent drop while acknowledging zero lead time and current on-hand inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows stable same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across many concluded periods) and demand has settled after earlier regime shifts. On-hand=14, in-transit=0, so any order arrives same period. To let the OR engine use its full-sample demand estimate and preserve service while avoiding overfilling, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples).

Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target the current lower demand regime (1+L)*mean \u2248 52.8, reducing excess inventory risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-10 (P18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand is volatile with a large spike in P17 (237) after several moderate weeks (P13-16: 46,35,49,62). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default L=0. To capture the recent regime (higher average and volatility) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (periods 13-17) so the OR engine targets service for the current elevated demand while limiting excess holding.

To prioritize service given high recent demand and equal profit/holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to react to the new higher regime; use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has spiked (Periods 17-19: 237,282,197). No overdue shipments. Set L=default (promised lead time 0, historically confirmed). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the new high mean from the last 5 weeks (Periods 15-19) while smoothing short noise. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility from the same window. These choices steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent sample volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: recent avg (P17-19)=238.67 units/week vs prior avg (P13-16)=48.0 units/week; sustained for 3 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Set L to default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime; choose N=4 (Periods 17-20) to reflect the most recent sustained shift. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=104, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent history shows lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand regime elevated since Period 17 (weekly demands P17-22 = 237,282,197,161,116,111; recent regime length = 6). No overdue/lost shipments. Set L to default to trust promised lead time (0) supported by concluded arrivals. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting horizon to the sustained recent regime; this focuses the backend forecast on the last 6 weeks so orders respond to the elevated but declining recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 17 (sustained: P17-24 = 237,282,197,161,116,111,104,104). On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so we have very little cover. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; use observed-average to reflect that. For demand forecast, detect changepoint at Period 17 and use the recent regime (Periods 17-24, length=8) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat (recent_N, N=8). This biases the base-stock toward the current high-demand regime and keeps service while accounting for holding cost parity (profit=holding= $1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand settled around ~100/week since Period 21 (demands: 116,111,104,104,76), on-hand=88, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current ~100-unit/week regime (Periods 21-25) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples). I also use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep target stock tuned to the current lower post-peak regime and avoid overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 21-26): [116,111,104,104,76,76], recent mean \u224897.8/wk; demand has moderated from the June peak and shows stable lower weekly demand over 6 periods. Lead time has been observed consistently as 0 in concluded history. I select L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate to the last 6 weeks, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and current low pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many P1..P27 confirms). Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 104,104,76,76,92) averages ~90.4/week; volatility moderate. To keep service while avoiding extra holding (profit=holding), use recent demand window to reflect current regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so backend uses (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples (~90.4). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history.

Recent demand (Periods 31-33 = 73, 38, 81) shows a lower, variable regime versus earlier high peaks; I treat the most recent 3 weeks as the best predictor for the next (review+lead) period. Set L to default (promised = 0) given stable concluded lead-time evidence. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current short-term mean (reduces overstating order quantities after earlier high-demand spikes). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the latest demand level while avoiding carrying excess inventory when in-transit is zero and shipments have not been lost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (orders ordered in Pn arrive in Pn); no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has stabilized around ~50/week (last 5 demands: 38,81,44,43,40; mean=49.2). To reflect current short lead time and recent demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend focuses stock on the latest demand pattern while limiting holding cost exposure (profit=holding so target service level moderate).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows no new sustained regime shift; last 7 weekly demands = [73,38,81,44,43,40,56], recent mean \u224853.57. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (P1..P37 arrivals same-period). I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using recent_N=7 to capture the current lower-season demand level. This balances service vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand rather than long-run averages; sigma uses recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical lead times consistently observed 0 (arrivals same period) \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 8 weeks P31-38 = 73,38,81,44,43,40,56,44) shows a stable moderate mean; use recent_N=8 to capture current regime for both demand mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding overweighting older high-volume summer spikes; using recent samples reduces holding cost while preserving service.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L using observed history. Recent weekly demand has settled lower than earlier spikes; using the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 35-39 demands = 43,40,56,44,43; mean\u224845.2) captures current regime and reduces excess holding. Profit=$1 and Holding=$1 imply q=0.5 (z*=0), so base-stock will track mu_hat; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns service with recent demand while limiting inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 0 across many periods; recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 40,56,44,43,30) has settled around ~43/week. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and no observed delays, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the recent demand level and observed variability, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0), recent demand has stabilized around ~41 units/week (Periods 37-41: 56,44,43,30,34 => mean 41.4). To balance service vs holding (profit=holding), use L=promised (default, 0) and base forecasts from the most recent 5 weeks to react to the current lower-demand regime while keeping safety from short variability using recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current observed demand and avoids excess holding given low in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has settled lower versus mid-year peaks: last 10 demand samples (Periods 34-43) show a lower average (~42 units/week). To reflect the recent lower regime while keeping responsiveness, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 10 samples). With profit=holding, service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) so base-stock ~ mu_hat; using recent estimates reduces excess holding while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand has been stable and moderate (recent weekly demands: P40-43 = 30,34,61,31); on-hand=17, in-transit=0, and historical lead time has been consistently 0. No new sustained changepoint detected. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). To make the forecast responsive to the recent lower-volatility regime since Period ~36, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (balances responsiveness vs sample noise). These parameters let the OR engine compute a base-stock targeted to recent demand and the known 0 lead time, avoiding excess holding while preserving service given current on-hand inventory.

Recent demand has settled lower since mid-year; last 8 weekly demands (P37-44) capture the current post-peak regime and recent holiday-week variation. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias forecasts toward latest regime and limit overweighting older high peaks. This keeps service reasonable while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201345) show consistent actual lead time = 0 and no new sustained demand regime change in the last 3+ periods (recent demands: 31,27,25, etc.). Profit and holding cost equal, so backend service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 using default statistics is appropriate. I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma from all samples, balancing fill rate and holding cost given stable recent demand.
