Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04): [64,46,43,52,63] imply mean \u2248 53.6 and moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Promised lead time is 0 and there are no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time, so use default lead time. Profit vs holding gives q = 19/(19+1)=0.95, favoring a high service level; therefore keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices are conservative given zero inventory and recent demand sample size.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show weekly mean ~53.6. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (70) arrived same period. I set L via calculate to use observed lead-time data (confirmed 0). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding implicit in OR) while avoiding overstock given current on-hand and low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived P1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1132.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period1 and Period2 orders arrived same period). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; recent demand samples (weeks in Jan/Feb) mean ~53.6/week so current on-hand is well below expected demand. I choose default lead time to keep using promised 0 (confirmed by arrivals). I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this leverages all available weekly history (no sustained regime change detected) and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1251.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent on-hand=3, in-transit=0; confirmed lead time = 0 from prior concludes (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). Demand shows a modest upward shift in the last 3 periods (45,60,66). To be responsive to the recent increase while keeping holding costs low, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the latest regime and for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility; this raises target base-stock modestly versus long-run mean and keeps the cap scaled to recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1405.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent on-hand=1, in-transit=0; last four observed demands (Periods1-4) = 45,60,66,74 showing a sustained upward shift vs historical samples (Jan data mean=53.6). No overdue shipments (lead time previously confirmed as 0). To protect service level against the clear recent demand rise I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=4 (captures the new regime) while keeping promised lead time. This raises target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while sigma from the same recent window reflects increased variability; that balances higher profit per unit vs low holding cost by focusing safety stock on a confirmed demand increase rather than all-time averages.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand samples: [64,46,43,52,63], mean=53.6, no evidence of a sustained regime shift. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; prior periods show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0). Given confirmed LT=0 and stable demand, use default population estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service (prevent stockouts vs recent demands ~54) with holding cost (low $1 vs profit $19).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand has averaged higher than the older Jan samples (last 6 demands mean \u224858.8 vs earlier mean \u224853.6). On-hand=30, in-transit=0 and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To match the short lead time and recent uptick, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu and sigma on the most recent 6 demand observations to capture the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and volatile: last 7 demands = [45,60,66,74,63,45,83], mean=62.3 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments; prior conclues confirm lead time = 0. I set L to default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (7 weeks available, within allowed bounds) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248 62.3. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the currently higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $19 vs holding $1 leads to a relatively high service quantile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent realized demand has increased (last 3 periods demands: 45 -> 83 -> 96 with two stockouts), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish aggressively. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show 0 lead time. I therefore keep L as default (promised). To capture the recent upswing, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes a base-stock reflecting the latest demand regime and higher volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). On-hand=65, in-transit=0; historical weekly mean demand \u224853.6. With LT=0 the review+lead horizon is one period, and current on-hand already covers ~1.2\xd7 expected period demand. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while letting the engine apply its capped order rule.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) across many periods and no sustained demand regime change; recent weekly demand varies but centers near historical mean. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses promised LT=0 and full-sample mean/variance to compute base stock, balancing service level versus holding cost given stable observed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple Period X conclude messages show arrived=ordered in same period). Recent weekly demand has been variable (sold range ~40\u201396) but no sustained regime shift of 3+ periods is evident. I choose default lead time to rely on the confirmed promised lead time, and default demand moments so the OR backend uses the full sample history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this lets the backend compute base stock with the correct profit/holding service-level tradeoff given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weeks show stable weekly demand with occasional spikes; on-hand=46, in-transit=0 so current cover is modest. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). I therefore use default lead time to let backend assume promised 0. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses full-sample mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service level against holding cost given confirmed L=0 and no missing shipments; this avoids overreacting to recent spikes while the on-hand position is healthy.

Date 2019-05-13. Recent weekly demand has stabilized around ~42 units/week (last 5 weeks: 40,43,44,39,43). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (concluded arrivals each period). To target service while limiting holding cost, set L to promised (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current short-term mean demand (1+L)*mean \u2248 41.8. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand variability.

Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods (arrivals observed same period). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=0.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weekly demand has varied widely (many weeks 40\u2013109, several spikes up to ~100+); on-hand=11, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low versus typical weekly demand. All observed concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. To let the OR backend use its full historical demand estimate and the proven lead time, I keep lead time at default (promised), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages full-sample statistics to balance service level (protect vs frequent high-demand weeks) against holding cost, while acknowledging no in-transit protection currently (will rely on immediate arrivals under L=0).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical weeks show higher recent demand (Periods 13-17 = 43,67,109,81,49; recent mean \u224869.8 vs older samples lower). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. To respond to the increased recent demand while keeping parameters simple, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (higher mean and variability), so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock and wider safety stock to avoid stockouts during the recent elevated demand periods while weighing holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and no lost shipments; recent demand has been variable but no sustained regime shift. I choose default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy stable given no strong evidence to change demand forecast or inflate safety stock, and avoids overreacting to recent spikes while balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has moderated but remains variable: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [109, 81, 49, 35, 55], avg \u2248 65.8. On-hand=36, in-transit=0 so no confirmed incoming arrivals or overdue shipments. Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0. I set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead time remains 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (last 5 weeks) and reduce influence of earlier-season data. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast tuned to current demand while keeping service level responsive and minimizing holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weekly demand has moderated from earlier peaks; last 5 realized demands = [81, 49, 35, 55, 17], mean=47.4 and visible on-hand=98, in-transit=0. Previous periods consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since arrivals have been immediate. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (sharp drop in last weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings reduce ordering toward the recent lower demand while preserving service given on-hand inventory, lowering holding exposure.

To reflect the recent regime (summer drop and variability), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weeks).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default L to let backend exploit same-period replenishment. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 33,52,39,22,19) shows a lower summer regime; I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean (~33) and avoids excess holding. Demand variability also appears reduced recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect lower short-term volatility and tighten safety stock. These settings balance high profit (q\u22480.95) with minimized holding cost given current low in-transit and observed summer demand dip.

Demand history is stable with no sustained changepoint; use default estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple P arrivals same period), so use promised/default lead time. No sustained/new demand regime detected; rely on full-sample estimates so the OR backend can compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Given profit $19 >> holding $1, this approach lets the backend target a high service level while the capped order prevents extreme replenishment and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 19,44,62,61,39) shows a moderate mean (~45) and variability \u2014 I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current summer demand regime rather than the full-sample average. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to adapt to the current regime, which helps the OR backend size a base stock that balances the $19 profit against $1 holding cost under recent demand levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed earlier) and no overdue shipments; on-hand=19, in-transit=0. Given stable historical service and no evidence of a sustained demand regime change, use the backend defaults so OR uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed as 0 in early periods and repeatedly observed), steady weekly demand with occasional spikes; current on-hand=47, in-transit=0 so no incoming units will be visible until next conclude. I choose default lead time to trust the promised 0 and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This keeps forecasting stable given no sustained regime change and balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show moderate/variable weekly demand (historical samples available across Feb\u2013Sep). No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time beyond previously recorded confirmation of 0-period lead time. I choose default lead time (use promised 0), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable regime and no overdue shipments.

Previous periods confirm actual lead time = 0. I set L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime including the recent spike and higher variability so the OR backend builds a base-stock that protects service while controlling holding cost.

Recent demand episodes include several high-demand weeks (e.g., Periods 15,33) but no sustained regime shift requiring adjustment. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, use default lead time and default demand moment estimates so the engine computes base_stock from all available samples. This balances service level (using full-history mean/variance) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (previously recorded). Recent demand has moderate variability but no sustained regime shift detected. To keep parameters stable and aligned with confirmed lead time, use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (prevent stockouts from recent spikes) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 35-39 demands = 50,41,50,67,64; recent mean ~54.4) and on-hand = 20, in-transit = 0. Prior history confirms actual lead time = 0. To align the OR base-stock with the current demand regime (late-season steady mid-high weekly demand) I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=5 for both forecast and volatility so \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the most recent demand level and variability. This keeps service high while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand recently ~50\u201367/week but no sustained regime change detected. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample; this leverages full history, respects confirmed L=0, and balances high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) via the OR engine's service-level formula.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95). No recent sustained demand regime shift evident in the historical weekly demand series. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma per full-sample statistics; this leverages all available history and the confirmed L=0 to balance high service level vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent conclude shows an isolated large demand spike (305) in Period 42 likely Black Friday/Cyber week; prior history exhibits stable weekly demand (mean ~56 from samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we expect to face current-period demand after ordering. No sustained regime change (spike is single period), and lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Therefore keep L at default (promised 0), use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to avoid overreacting to single-week spike\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) but low holding cost ($1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand shows a large holiday spike (Periods 42-43: 305 then 157) after typical weekly volumes ~40\u201380. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (carry-over). To capture the recent regime (holiday uplift) while limiting overreaction, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (covers the last 5 weeks including the spike weeks). This raises the base_stock to reflect elevated short-term demand and the capped order will limit extreme orders while balancing profit ($19) vs $1 holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=256, in-transit=0. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a one-off large spike in Period 42 (demand=305) followed by large replenishments (ordered 126 in P43, 307 in P44) leaving substantial on-hand. Given high stock and confirmed LT=0, use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and the promised lead time. This avoids overreacting to the single extreme spike while letting the OR engine compute the z* service level (q=19/(19+1)=0.95) to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=205, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a large transient spike (Period 42 demand=305, P43=157) but subsequent weeks returned to ~51; to balance service vs holding given high profit/higher service quantile (q=19/(19+1)=0.95) I keep lead time at promised (confirmed historically as 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent elevated mean and volatility while limiting influence of older data (last 5 demands: 45,305,157,51,51). This raises target base-stock to defend against stockouts from recent demand variability while avoiding excessive long-run holding cost because on-hand is already 205.
