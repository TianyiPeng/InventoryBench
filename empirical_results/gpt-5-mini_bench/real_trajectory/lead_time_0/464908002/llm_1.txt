Lead time & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Supplier promised LT=0 but no concluded arrivals yet; LT could be 0 or >0 \u2014 treat same-period arrival as possible but not guaranteed. Inventory decision logic: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit/unit, so overstock is costly; prefer to order enough to meet expected near-term demand but avoid large safety stock. Given downward trend, modest order sized to serve expected current-week demand (conservative ~40 units) balances service vs holding risk and allows potential capture of any Valentine uplift if orders arrive same-period. If actual lead time >0 and order doesn't arrive this period, sales will be lost this period but holding risk is avoided.",
