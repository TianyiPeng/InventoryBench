Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (week). Product: sports bra; recent historical weekly demand samples average ~68.4 (samples: 81,48,71,68,74). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals exist so cannot infer a lead-time change. Promised lead time used (default). Use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overcommitment given zero inventory and normal historical demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sale: Period1 sold 56, ending on-hand 33, in-transit 0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb) average ~68. Use lead time estimate from observed arrivals: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=0, so set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times. Demand and uncertainty use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to full-sample demand, balancing service (profit$19 vs holding$1) without overreacting to a single period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent actual concluded demand: Period1 sold 56, Period2 sold 60. On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in Periods 1 and 2 (ordered arrived same period). I set L via calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean across historical samples) to avoid overreacting to two low recent weeks while keeping service levels adequate given low holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show higher demand (mean\u224868) but the last 3 concluded periods show lower, stable demand (P1..P3 demands = 56,60,54; recent mean\u224856.7). All observed lead times = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the confirmed downward shift in demand and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 1\u20133 recent mean=56.67 vs earlier sample mean\u224868 (\u221216.6%), sustained for 3 periods (P1\u2013P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20134): 56, 60, 54, 65 \u2192 recent mean 58.75, lower than earlier sample mean (~68) noted in carry-over. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals; observed concluded lead times = 0 for all past orders. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual experience (calculate). I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (last 4 periods) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; backend will scale mu_hat by (1+L). This keeps target base-stock conservative vs. older higher mean, reducing holding cost while retaining service for the current lower-demand level. Sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time = 0 consistently (orders placed P1\u2013P5 all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been somewhat lower than the initial sample but not yet a sustained new regime beyond what's already recorded; no lost shipments. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the full sample set, balancing service level and holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 2\u20136): [60,54,65,52,70], recent mean=60.2. On-hand=11, in-transit=0; all concluded orders (P1\u2013P6) had lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. Use L='calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (reduces influence of older Jan samples); mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean_recent = 1*60.2. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current lower recent demand while the short lead time lets the OR engine respond quickly, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u20137) = [52, 70, 63], recent mean \u2248 61.67. On-hand = 10, in-transit = 0, promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because all concluded orders show 0 and there is no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest regime (P5\u2013P7) where mean rose above the early dip; mu_hat uses the 1+L scaled recent mean (1\xd761.67 \u2248 61.67). Volatility also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current variability (std of [52,70,63] ~ 9.43 scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1). This keeps the base-stock tuned to the most recent demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older samples. With only 10 on-hand and no pipeline, this will prompt orders to refill toward the recent demand-based base stock, balancing service (high profit $19) against low holding cost $1.

Demand recent history shows variation but no new sustained regime shift since prior insight; therefore use observed lead time average and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (every period arrival showed lead_time=0), so use promised/default L. Recent demand shows a modestly lower regime than the earliest samples but recent volatility (P5\u2013P9 = 52,70,63,81,35) is most relevant; recent 5 mean = 60.2 units. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the most recent regime, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent 81 and prior spikes) against holding cost given on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=56, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P10 arrived same period). Demand history shows recent variability; last 5 concluded demands (P6\u2013P10) average captures recent mix of high and low weeks better than full-sample mean. To keep responsiveness while limiting holding cost (profit=$19 vs holding=$1), use promised/default lead time=0, a recent-5 forecast for mu_hat so the base-stock adapts to recent demand, and default sigma to reflect full-sample volatility to avoid underestimating risk.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; recent demand has softened vs earlier sample. I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand I bias to the recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 7\u201311: 63,81,35,34,32) so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent lower demand while preserving service vs holding tradeoff.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times = 0 every concluded period, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has softened vs earlier sample: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 8\u201312) = [81,35,34,32,51], recent 5-mean \u224846.6 vs earlier full-sample mean \u224868. To adapt the forecast to the recent lower regime while keeping responsiveness, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent drop). This reduces target base-stock and variability to avoid excess holding given low holding cost but material profit, balancing service vs holding risk.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has settled well below the historical sample mean: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [35,34,32,51,47], mean=39.8. On-hand=34, in-transit=0 so available coverage \u22480.85 weeks at recent demand\u2014low. All observed lead times = 0 (orders in history concluded with lead_time 0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. To align ordering with the recent lower demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the last 5 demand samples (N=5) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility focused on current regime, reducing overstated replenishment driven by older higher-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime confirmed: Periods 9\u201313 avg=39.8 vs earlier sample mean\u224868 (\u221241%), sustained for 5 periods (P9\u2013P13).

Recent demand has shifted down (Periods 9\u201313 mean\u224839.8, sustained 5 periods); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to anchor forecast to the lower regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the lower recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstocks while preserving service given the sustained drop in demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been well below earlier sample mean. Historical concluded lead times are 0 each period so I keep L as promised (default). Demand regime confirmed low in recent weeks, so I set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 concluded demands: P11\u2013P15 = 32,51,47,36,66 \u2192 mean=46.4) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower variability. These choices reduce overstock risk from historical higher mean while preserving service with backlog=0.

Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 9\u201313 avg\u224839.8) vs earlier sample mean\u224868; no missing shipments and concluded lead times = 0 historically. To respond to the lower recent demand while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures Periods 12\u201316 demand: 51,47,36,66,37) to reflect current mean/volatility and avoid overstock given holding cost and high profit-driven service target.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent on-hand=28, in-transit=0; no shipments overdue. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded messages show arrived same period ordered). Historical demand samples (seed) mean \u224868.4; recent weeks show lower demand but not a sustained new regime that is both recent and clearly distinct from historical samples. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed reliable 0 lead time and stable long-run demand seed, I select default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This keeps service high given product profitability (profit $19, holding $1) while avoiding ad-hoc downshifts based on short recent noise.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have all been 0 (orders in P1\u2013P18 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 14\u201318) = [36,66,37,40,40], recent mean = 43.8 over last 5 weeks, substantially below the early-sample mean (~68) and matches previously recorded regime shifts. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments. To balance service vs holding cost given high unit profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1), use a short lead time (promised/default=0) and base stock driven by recent demand: set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 weeks) so the OR backend targets inventory for the current lower-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstock from older higher-demand periods while preserving service for current demand levels.

Recent demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 66,37,40,40,55) shows lower mean than earlier samples; this recent regime persisted 5 periods so use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR backend on current demand. No evidence of lost shipments. This raises service-level targeting for current lower demand while reducing excess holding cost exposure.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=18, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, I use recent demand estimates over the last 5 periods (Periods 16\u201320) which capture the current lower regime and recent variability. L default keeps promised lead time (0). mu_hat recent_N=5 provides (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand to reflect current lower demand. sigma_hat recent_N=5 uses recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately and reduce holding cost exposure given slim on-hand and no pipeline.

Recent demand has been lower than the original sample mean; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201322) = [40,55,51,25,38], recent mean \u2248 41.8. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 5 samples (captures recent trough around Periods 18\u201322). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering vs. using the historical long-run mean while preserving service given current on-hand stock.

Recent carry-over insights record prior demand regime shifts (Periods 1\u20133 and 9\u201313) but no new sustained change in the last several periods. To avoid overreacting to short fluctuations and because lead time has been stable, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma from all samples. This keeps service vs. holding cost balanced given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent weekly demand has settled well below the original sample mean: Periods 21\u201324 demand = [25,38,48,24], avg=33.75, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs historical ~68. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent demand regime I use recent_N based on the most recent 4 weeks (regime length=4) for both forecast mean and volatility; this keeps (1+L)-scaling consistent while reducing stock to avoid excess holding cost given high profit-to-holding ratio (q high -> higher service desired but recent lower demand reduces mu_hat). No in-transit units; on-hand=55 provides coverage but parameters will lower future orders to match the new regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical actual lead time has been 0 in concluded periods; no evidence of delays. Demand has been in a lower regime since mid-May (carry-over insight from Period 14). Recent 5-period demand (Periods 21\u201325 = 25,38,48,24,29; mean=32.8) remains below earlier historical mean, so I bias forecasts to recent observations to avoid excess holding cost. Set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent regime and reduced demand/volatility, which helps the OR backend lower target base stock and cap orders to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand remains in the lower regime (Periods 22\u201326 demands = 38,48,24,29,34; recent mean \u224834.6, consistent with prior carry-over insight showing sustained lower demand). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so coverage is low versus even reduced demand; using promised lead time (default L=0) is appropriate because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend will size a lower base-stock and limit holding cost while preserving service for the observed regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand has been lower than initial sample; last 5 demand observations (Periods 23\u201327 = 48,24,29,34,57) average \u224838.4. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent lower regime and keep safety against overstock. Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability from full-sample std (\u221a(1+L)\xd7std). These choices bias orders toward the recent lower demand while preserving default uncertainty handling and avoiding overreaction to a single high week (P27=57).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=38, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent across history). Recent demand (last 5 weeks: P24\u2013P28 demand = 24,29,34,57,27) is noisy with no sustained new regime; use an EWMA forecast to adapt to recent swings while retaining historical weight. Set L to default (promised=0). Use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to smoothly adapt to recent demand. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture short-run demand volatility for the OR engine's safety stock cap and balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been well below the historical sample mean (five most recent periods P25\u2013P29 demands = [29,34,57,27,31], recent mean \u224835.6 vs sample mean \u224868), indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower mean across the review+lead window, reducing overstock risk. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (so safety stock scales to recent variation). These choices prioritize reducing holding cost while keeping service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 26\u201330) = [34,57,27,31,41], recent mean=38.0 which is well below historical early-sample mean (~68) and matches prior recorded regime shifts. I set L='default' (promised 0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 weeks) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. This focuses the base-stock on current lower demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower-demand regime versus the early-sample mean (carry-over notes: P1\u2013P3 down ~16%; P9\u201313 down ~41%). Recent 5 demands (P27\u2013P31) = [57,27,31,41,27], recent mean\u224836.6 which is materially below the full-sample mean (~68). Promised lead time=0 and all concluded lead times have been 0, so use default lead time. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and high profit/low holding cost tradeoff, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent N=5 periods (captures current low regime). This focuses the base-stock on current demand while keeping variability estimate responsive.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has fallen sharply versus historical: last 5 weeks demand = [27,31,41,27,16] (mean ~28.4) vs long-run ~68. On-hand=42, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so keep L as default. To capture the new low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the 5-period recent regime). This reduces target base-stock and conserves holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Periods 28\u201332 avg=28.4 vs earlier sample mean\u224868 (\u221258%), sustained for 5 periods (P28\u2013P32).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically observed as 0 in concluded history. Recent demand shows a low-volatility, lower-mean regime with a noisy uptick in Period 33. To be responsive to the most recent demand pattern while avoiding overweighting a single spike, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 periods (Periods 29\u201333) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L=default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. This choice lets the OR engine set a base-stock reflecting recent demand (improving service given zero on-hand) while sigma estimated from the same recent window balances safety stock vs. holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical samples show sustained low-demand regime detected earlier (carry-over: P28\u2013P32 avg=28.4; P9\u2013P13 and P1\u2013P3 earlier drops). Recent 5-period window (P31\u2013P35 demands = 27,16,54,30,12) reflects the low regime with some noise. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L to match supplier promise. To keep inventory lean given high profit/low holding cost tradeoff and recent lower demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime while meeting the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This reduces target base-stock to reflect the sustained lower demand and limits holding cost while preserving service for expected demand variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 so keep default L. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 33 (P28\u2013P32 and P33\u2013P36 show substantially lower demand vs original sample); to adapt the forecast to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures P32\u2013P36 recent behavior) so the OR backend will target a smaller base-stock and reduce holding cost while preserving service.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders in history all arrived same period), so use default promised L. Recent demand has dropped sharply: Periods 34\u201337 demands = [30,12,19,17], indicating a new low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to focus the OR forecast on this sustained low regime (N=4 = length of the detected recent regime). This keeps base-stock and caps small to limit holding cost while preserving service for the lower demand level. No overdue shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Periods 34\u201337 avg=19.5 vs earlier sample mean\u224868 (\u221271%), sustained for 4 periods (P34\u2013P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 33 with particularly low averages in Periods 34\u201337; demand remains depressed. All observed lead times have been 0 historically, so keep L as promised (default). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat using a recent_N estimator over the last 5 samples (Periods 34\u201338) so the (1+L)-period forecast tracks the recent lower mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility rather than the larger historical variance. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service for the current low-demand regime. No evidence of lost shipments requiring an explicit L change.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand remains well below the long-run sample mean; use recent data to reflect the lower recent regime and avoid excess holdings. I choose L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 34\u201339) to capture the most recent low/variable demand (demands: 30,12,19,17,34,25). This keeps the base-stock aligned to current lower demand and reduces holding cost while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 \u2014 no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand has moved to a lower regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340 = 19, 17, 34, 25, 26) average ~24.2. To reflect this recent low-demand regime while keeping volatility responsive, I use the promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime without overfitting). This biases orders toward current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; recent demand has settled at a lower regime since earlier periods (carry-over insights note sustained drops through Period 38). No overdue arrivals. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and no evidence of persistent lead-time increase. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (P37\u2013P41 = 17,34,25,26,30) average \u224826.4 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean reflects this. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older higher-variance samples. These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given low sales and small on-hand inventory, while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand regime is low (carry-over shows sustained declines); Periods 38\u201341 demand = 34,25,26,30 (mean\u224828.75). Period 42 had a large one-off spike (123) likely event-driven (Black Friday) and is not yet a sustained regime change, so I exclude it from the recent baseline. Use promised/default lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent stable short-run (last 4 periods, P38\u2013P41) to reflect the low-demand regime while avoiding the single spike. This biases orders down to reduce holding cost while keeping service for typical demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand shows a one-period spike in Period 42 (123 units) likely promotional/holiday noise; no sustained (>3 periods) regime change. To balance responsiveness to recent lower demand while damping the single spike, use an EWMA forecast for mu_hat with modest smoothing (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This yields a demand forecast that privileges recent observations without overreacting to the isolated spike, controlling holding cost while maintaining service.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 26,30,123,22,9) shows a single large spike at P42 but otherwise low demand; to adapt to the recent lower regime while damping the single-week spike I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a reduced base stock and limits new receipts (reducing holding cost) while still allowing for the elevated service level implied by profit/holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so keep L=default (promised=0). Demand has shown multiple downward regime shifts earlier (recorded) but very recent weeks are volatile with two large spikes (Periods 42 and 45) separated by low weeks; the latest spike (P45) is not yet a sustained regime change. To balance service level vs holding cost I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent demand more while damping single-period spikes, and estimate sigma from the most recent 5 samples to capture current volatility without overfitting older regimes. This combination gives the OR backend a responsive central forecast and a short-window volatility measure to determine base stock and the capped ordering quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a sharp holiday spike (Periods 42\u201346) and high volatility; to capture this short-term regime I use recent_N=5 to compute demand mean and std across the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 42\u201346). This biases orders toward servicing elevated holiday demand while the default L keeps arrival timing consistent with observed lead time=0. Using recent data helps the OR backend balance service (avoid stockouts during the spike) versus holding cost once demand normalizes.
