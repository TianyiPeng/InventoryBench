Rationale: OR's cap and base-stock already balance expected demand and safety stock for L=0 using the profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8); given confirmed 0 lead time and current low on-hand (16), ordering 119 replenishes inventory to OR's target to cover likely high holiday demand while avoiding excessive holding cost.
