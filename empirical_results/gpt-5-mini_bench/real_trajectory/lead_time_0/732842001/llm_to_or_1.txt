Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a rapid upward shift in the last 3 samples (2019-01-21:36, 2019-01-28:100, 2019-02-04:215). To respond quickly to the new higher regime while respecting the promised lead time, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 3 weeks. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new mean demand over the review+lead period, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service for the observed spike while keeping variability estimates scoped to the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 117 units (36,100,215) vs prior 2-week avg = 0.5 (-99% \u2192 + huge increase); treat as new higher-demand regime

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime confirmed (spike starting 2019-01-21); recent high-demand samples: 36,100,215 and Period1 observed demand=167. Promised lead time 0 was observed (Period1 order arrived same period). I set L=default to trust promised 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (keeps base_stock responsive to the recent higher mean). For sigma I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base_stock to reduce lost sales while limiting excess hold given high holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand remains at a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (samples since then: 36,100,215,167,156). Observed lead times in concluded history are 0 periods (orders placed P1 and P2 arrived same period). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (0) rather than the promised default to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (the 5-sample post-changepoint regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples), capturing the new higher mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices prioritize meeting the higher realized demand while keeping holding exposure aligned to the short confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21; concluded demands last 3 periods = 167,156,125 (avg ~149). On-hand=10, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead times have been 0 historically, so keep L=default. To capture the new higher-demand regime and recent variability, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the last 3 periods' demand). Match sigma_hat to recent volatility using recent_N N=3. These choices focus the base-stock on the current high-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21: recent sold/demand in concluded periods = [167,156,125,117]. On-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time=0 in all concluded periods, so keep L as default. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (use the last 4 concluded periods which define the new regime). Using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility rather than diluting with pre-regime zeros. These parameters steer the OR backend to set base stock consistent with the new higher mean while reflecting current variability, balancing service (profit per unit = holding cost) against holding cost exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has settled into the higher regime identified earlier (post-2019-01-21). Last 5 concluded period demands: 167,156,125,117,103; on-hand=39, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. I set L to 'calculate' (avg observed lead time = 0) so the OR engine uses confirmed 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 (most recent regime-stable periods: demands 125,117,103 \u2192 mean=115) to capture the current elevated but slightly declining demand; with L=0 this yields mu_hat \u2248115 demand across review+lead. Sigma based on these 3 recent samples captures current variability. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 with recent weekly demand ~117,103,115; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must refill to cover upcoming week. Observed lead times have consistently been 0 periods, so keep L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new regime (most relevant recent weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets around the current higher mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given zero inventory) versus holding cost by not using long-run low-demand data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently, so keep L as default (promised=0). Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; use recent demand to set forecast. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 7 realized weekly demands = 167,156,125,117,103,115,112) so the OR backend targets current higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand after the regime shift (from 2019-01-21) has averaged higher than pre-shift; latest week (P8) dipped to 57 but prior 7 weeks ranged 103\u2013167. On-hand=71, in-transit=0 so available cover is limited. I keep L=default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0 actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the full post-shift regime) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing the P8 dip. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias base-stock toward the new regime to avoid stockouts while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand after the regime shift remains elevated vs pre-2019-01-21. On-hand=47, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To be responsive to recent demand volatility and reduced averages in the last 5 weeks (periods 5-9 = 103,115,112,57,72), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets inventory for the near-term realized demand; this balances service (capturing recent mean ~91.8 units) against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent realized lead times have been 0 (all concluded arrivals same period) and on-hand=29, in-transit=0 so available supply is low. Demand history shows a clear downward movement over the last 3 periods (57,72,63) compared with earlier higher-week means; to avoid excess holding I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent low-demand regime. With profit=holding, the backend will target z*=0 so using recent 3-week mean/std prevents overshooting inventory after the recent drop.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Recent demand has downshifted from the initial spike but remains volatile (last 7 demand samples: P5-P11 = 103,115,112,57,72,63,98; mean \u2248 88.6). Observed concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. I choose L by calculating average observed lead time to confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime while meeting the requirement (N between 3 and 20). Sigma uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent mean ~89 units) vs holding cost by avoiding carry from older high-spike samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders in Periods 1\u201312 all arrived same period), so keep L=default (promised=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over insight previously recorded). Recent weeks (Periods 8\u201312) show varying demand but no new sustained drop; to capture the current regime and recent variability I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (balances responsiveness to recent demand pattern vs. noise). This ensures the backend estimates demand across the review+lead period using the latest observed regime while limiting overreaction to single-week spikes. With on-hand+pipeline=0 this will prompt replenishment to restore service while the sigma estimate controls safety stock to limit holding costs.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover this higher recent demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1-13), so use calculated lead time. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current higher-demand regime, balancing service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled into the higher regime identified starting 2019-01-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default (promised=0). To capture the current elevated demand level and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses the last 6 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases orders toward the recent ~90 units/week demand pattern, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

I set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime using the most recent stable window. I set sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock focused on current demand while avoiding overstating variability given stable recent observations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). SKU 732842001 on-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 but has variability; profit = holding ($1/$1) implies critical fractile 0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. No overdue or lost shipments visible. I select default lead time to reflect observed 0-period arrivals and use default demand estimates (all-samples mean/std scaled by (1+L)) to smooth regime noise and let the OR engine set base stock; this balances service (use full-history mean) versus holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (every concluded order had lead_time 0). Demand regime shifted up around 2019-01-21 (already recorded). Recent weeks (Periods 13-17 demands = 89,108,99,60,45) show a pullback versus the mid-April peak; this suggests using a recent-window estimate to capture the current softer demand. On-hand = 51, in-transit = 0; with L=0 the OR backend will compute base stock for a 1-period horizon. I set L to default (promised lead time 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the last 5 demand observations so the backend balances service level against holding cost given the recent demand decline. No new sustained changepoint (3+ periods) beyond the previously recorded regime shift.

Demand has settled lower vs the initial spike; recent 6-week demand (Periods 13-18 = 89,108,99,60,45,38) shows a lower mean and reduced variability. I keep L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to make the forecast and safety stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime, reducing excess holding while preserving service.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has declined from late-May (Periods 15-19 demand = 99,60,45,38,34) suggesting a lower recent mean versus the earlier spike. No evidence of lead-time slips (all concluded lead_times = 0). To capture the recent lower demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=5 covering the most recent 5 weeks) and recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. Keep L as default (promised 0) because observed lead times are consistently 0. This will lower the base stock to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost ($1), while preserving service by using recent demand stats.

Demand shifted up in early history (already recorded). Given stable concluded lead time and no new sustained regime change in recent weeks, use default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Profit=holding so service quantile q=0.5 (z=0) \u2014 this makes base_stock driven by mu_hat, which balances fill rate vs holding costs given current evidence.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has settled well below the large Jan/Feb spike; last 6 demands (Periods 17-22 decision uses data through Period 21) show a lower, more stable regime (~45\u219221\u219254 recent variability). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus a short replenishment. Promised lead time history shows all concluded lead_times = 0, so use default lead time. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6-week regime to capture current lower-demand mean and volatility (N=6 is between the minimum 3 and captures the recent stable pattern). This balances service (capture recent average demand) against holding cost by avoiding carry-over of inventory sized for the earlier spike. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0), so keep L as promised (default). Demand since the Jan regime shift has stabilized into a lower-but-variable weekly pattern since May; use a recent-window estimate to capture current mean/volatility rather than the full-sample elevated early-January spike. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 (captures Periods 15\u201322 demand behavior) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects near-term demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk from the January spike while maintaining service for recent demand levels.

Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: 34,21,54,65,31; mean=41) is lower than earlier peak regime; no new sustained regime change detected. Use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to recent demand variability while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled well below the initial peak; last 5 weekly demands = {P20:21, P21:54, P22:65, P23:31, P24:22}, 5-week mean \u224838.6. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0). To balance equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) and respond to the recent lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised), use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the last 5 weeks to capture current regime (1+L times mean \u224838.6), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods \u2014 no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand (last 8 weeks: 38,34,21,54,65,31,22,55) averages ~40/week with noticeable volatility; using the most recent 8 samples captures current summer demand pattern while avoiding older-season data. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to the current regime and observed variability, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has settled lower (~40\u201355) since early summer after the jump in Jan\u2013Feb (carry-over insight already recorded). No evidence of lead-time shifts (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while covering the current and lead periods, use promised lead time (default) and baseline demand estimated from the most recent observations. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand level and reduce overweighting earlier high spikes; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to current demand, limits overstock given $1/unit holding cost, and maintains service without assuming delayed shipments.

A demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 is already recorded in carry-over history. No new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time and demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=0 and no new evidence of demand shift beyond the documented regime.

Recent demand has settled lower than early 2019 spike; last 5 demand samples (P25-P29 demand: 55,52,97,71,? \u2014 using most recent 5 concluded weeks) average indicates ~69/week. To be responsive to recent demand shifts and minimize holding cost, I'll use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current demand level and volatility while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Demand regime shift to higher demand was recorded earlier (Period 1 insight) and recent weeks remain variable; to react to recent demand patterns I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest mean and volatility while avoiding overweighting older data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weekly demand has settled around ~60\u201370 units (Periods 28-30: 71,57,61). On-hand=6, in-transit=0, so current coverage is very low. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L=default (promised 0). To focus the forecast on the recent demand level and reduce influence of early-year regime shift, use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variability (5-week window balances responsiveness and noise). This encourages the OR engine to target a base stock near recent demand while controlling holding cost given current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so keep L=default (promised=0). Demand has settled from the large early-2019 spike into a more stable mid-range (recent weekly demand mostly 40\u2013100). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime and reduce influence of the large Feb spike. I choose N=12 (roughly last 3 months of data) to capture recent seasonality while keeping sample >=3 and <=20. This yields (1+L)-scaled recent mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)-scaled recent std for sigma_hat so the OR engine balances service (avoid stockouts with modest z) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime from 2019-01-21 onward; recent demand (most recent 20 weeks) better reflects current level and seasonality through late summer. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=20) to capture current regime while avoiding overweighting early low-demand weeks. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. This balances service (use recent elevated mean) against holding cost (not using an overly large explicit safety buffer).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders concluded with lead_time 0 across history). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (noted earlier); recent 5 weeks demand = [57,61,56,46,92] with a spike in the last week. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) use a short-term recent estimate to capture current demand level while keeping safety stock moderate. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the recent demand pattern and volatility, allowing the OR backend to compute base_stock and cap based on current pipeline and observed variability.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 30-34) averages ~57 units/week with occasional spikes (Period 33=92) but no new sustained regime change since earlier noted shift. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no fresh changepoint, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this balances service level vs holding cost with current profit=holding (q=0.5) and the backend's capped ordering rule. Ordering now is needed because on-hand and pipeline are nearly zero.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period fulfillment (observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders), so keep L as default (promised=0). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (noted in carry-over). To focus the forecast on the recent demand regime and capture current variability, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent 8 periods to balance responsiveness and sample size. This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) against holding cost by using recent demand metrics rather than long-run averages.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so keep L as promised (default). Recent weekly demand has settled below the early 2019 spike; using a short recent window (N=5) captures current demand level (last 5 demands: P32-P36 = 46,92,57,45,40 => mean \u224856) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current regime and recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent lower demand while avoiding overweighting old high values and guards against excess holding given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time=0 with no lost shipments; earlier carried-over insight records the 2019-01-21 demand regime shift. Recent weekly demand (Periods 31\u201337 = 56,46,92,57,45,40,50) averages ~55 units and reflects current sales cadence including a single spike (92) but otherwise steady mid-40s to mid-50s. I keep L as default (promised 0). I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures current mean/variance while limiting influence of long-ago low-demand history). This balances service (meet ~55/week) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1), avoiding excessive safety stock from older high-variance data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weekly demand has settled lower than the initial post-shift spike: last 8 demands (Periods 31-38) average \u2248 56\u2192 but last 3 weeks are ~45 (Periods 36-38: 40,50,46). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L to keep backend assumption. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost, use a recent-window demand estimate: mu_hat recent_N captures the current regime level better than full-history mean. Use N=8 to balance responsiveness and stability. For volatility, use recent_N with N=8 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These parameters prioritize matching current demand (reduce overstock) while preserving service given no observed lead-time delays.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has settled to a lower steady level vs the early 2019 jump; last 8 realized demands (Periods 33-40) average ~54\u2192 recent 8-week window captures current regime and smooths noise. On-hand=13, in-transit=0; with promised lead time historically confirmed as 0, use promised (default) lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect current demand mean/volatility and avoid overweighting early high spikes. This balances service (by matching recent demand) vs holding cost (avoids inflating base stock from older high-demand weeks).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 10 weeks) has averaged ~50.7 units/week; historical lead times observed = 0. Profit=Holding so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) meaning base_stock = mu_hat. I use L=default (promised 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N=10 to capture the current stable post-changepoint regime and recent volatility while avoiding older low-demand samples. This keeps target stock near recent weekly demand and limits holding cost given equal profit/holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods; recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) is low (~29\u201345 units/week). Use promised/default lead time to match supplier behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current lower-demand regime and avoid overstock; keep sigma_hat default to let backend use overall demand volatility scaling. This balances service (responsive ordering to recent demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all prior orders arrived same period), no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Demand history exhibits a sustained higher-demand regime established from 2019-01-21 onward (already recorded). Given profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile q=0.5 -> z*=0, so a simple baseline using the backend defaults is appropriate: keep promised lead time, use all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to recent week-to-week variability while ensuring the OR engine computes a neutral risk buffer.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent weekly demand has been moderate and variable (last 8 demands: 40,50,46,41,34,29,63,18) and on-hand=53, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead_times=0). I set L=default to use promised 0. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast/uncertainty to the most recent demand regime (captures recent drop from early-year spike and current variability). This keeps base_stock responsive to current demand while sigma_hat recent_N informs safety-stock; with profit=holding, critical fractile=0.5 so OR will center on the recent mean, balancing service vs. holding given limited pipeline and no outstanding arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand shows no new sustained regime shift beyond the previously recorded Jan 2019 increase. No overdue arrivals observed. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps policy simple and lets backend compute base stock consistent with historical demand and equal profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. No new lead-time evidence (historical concludes all show lead_time=0); keep promised lead time. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: Periods 41-45) shows moderate mean and variability amid holiday churn, so set demand estimates using recent_N=5 to capture current regime and volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time = 0 across many periods (orders consistently arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand regime shift (noted previously starting 2019-01-21) remains the primary demand signal; no new sustained changepoint in last periods. With zero pipeline, we must replenish to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. I select default methods so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base_stock and cap, balancing unit profit=$1 vs holding=$1 to target the backend's q=0.5 service quantile.
