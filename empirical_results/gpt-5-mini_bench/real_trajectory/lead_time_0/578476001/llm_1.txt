  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is week of 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year). No obvious product-specific holiday spike for womens trousers; demand tends to be variable in Dec (observed spikes in early Dec/Nov weeks). Lead time: confirmed 0 periods from history (all orders concluded same period). Recent demand: P43\u2013P46 = {72,112,125,79}, recent 4-week avg \u224897. On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0, so current inventory covers ~0.6 of recent expected weekly demand. Economics: Profit = $19/unit >> Holding = $1/unit/period so stockouts are much costlier than modest holding. Ordering arrives same period and can be used to meet demand. Order logic: target enough stock to cover expected week (~97) plus modest safety (\u224810%) given variability. With 61 on-hand, order = round(max(0, 97*1.10 - 61)) \u2248 46; round to a conservative 40 to balance holding vs. uncertainty.",
