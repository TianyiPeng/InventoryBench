Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples show a clear upward trend (19,46,48,62,85). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for rising demand. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, so keep L as promised (default). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the upward regime across all 5 available samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect volatility in the same window. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher mu_hat) to avoid stockouts given the persistent increase while sigma_hat captures observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: early-period avg (first 2 weeks 2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) = 32.5 vs recent 3-week avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = 65 (+100%); sustained increase over 3+ periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime confirmed (higher recent mean). On-hand=25, in-transit=0, last period sold 67 from a 92 start -> ending 25. Observed lead time = 0 (Period1 order arrived same period). I set L to default (promised 0) since concluded data matches promised. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the sustained higher regime (recent samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 mean=65) so mu_hat targets (1+L)*65=65 units review+lead. For variability I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to replenish toward the new higher mean while limiting holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Observed arrivals: Period1 and Period2 both show arrived with lead_time=0 \u2192 confirm actual lead time = 0. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime (earlier carry-over): recent weeks much higher than early samples; to react quickly I use recent data. Set L by calculation of observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (uses most recent three demand samples: 2019-02-04:85, Period1:67, Period2:173) to capture current elevated mean while avoiding overreaction to a single spike. Use sigma recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost exposure limited by using a short recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2918.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent realized lead times = 0 (Periods 1-3 concluded arrivals same period). Demand has shifted up and stabilized over the last 3 periods (demands: 67, 173, 156). To capture the new regime while retaining short lead time, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the latest 3-period mean/volatility (captures elevated average ~132 units and higher variability). This balances higher service level for elevated demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=116, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (period demands: 67,173,156,110 plus earlier samples). Lead times observed in concluded history are 0 periods consistently. I use L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (last 3 demand samples show elevated mean: 173,156,110) and reduce influence of older low samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent observations; with profit >> holding cost this biases toward service level rather than minimal holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent on-hand=133, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P5 arrived same period), so set L by observed data. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20135) = [67,173,156,110,67], showing a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier Jan samples. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime; using calculate for L (avg observed lead time=0). This raises the target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability supports an adequate safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-6): [67,173,156,110,67,107]; on-hand=89, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P6) show lead_time=0 consistently, so I infer actual lead time = 0 and use 'calculate' to reflect observed history. Demand appears to have settled lower than the mid-period spike; I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 4\u20136 demand = 110,67,107 -> avg\u224894.67) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and avoid over-ordering after the large P2\u2013P3 spike. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) captures recent volatility. These settings aim to keep base stock aligned to current demand (raise service level for recent demand) while limiting excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) shows consistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals indicate lead_time 0). Demand has sustained at a higher regime since Period 3 (recent demands: P3\u2013P7 = 156,110,67,107,121). On-hand=14, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To keep service high given profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.95 \u2192 high z*), I use: L calculated from observed lead times (confirming 0); mu_hat based on recent_N (last 5 concluded demand samples) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime; sigma_hat based on recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period using recent demand evidence while avoiding overweighting older low-demand weeks.

Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service vs holding given current inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (recent weeks avg ~65 vs earlier ~32.5) but no new changepoint since that was already recorded. All concluded orders show actual lead_time = 0 (every conclude lists lead_time 0) and current pipeline=0 with on-hand=139. To keep the backend aligned with observed behavior we use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 0) and default demand/statistics so the OR engine uses all samples for (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (capturing the confirmed higher-demand regime via historical samples) against holding cost given a large on-hand position and no in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=128, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 107,121,74,22,31) suggests lower recent mean than earlier spike; use a short recent window to capture current regime. Set L=calculate to confirm observed lead time=0 from history. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods' demand, capturing the recent downshift. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given high on-hand while keeping service level aligned with high profit/low holding cost.

I choose default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level with low holding cost given current ample on-hand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped vs earlier spikes (last 4 weeks demand = [22,31,18,24], avg\u224823.75) so I use recent demand to avoid over-ordering. Promised lead time and observed lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime (covers review+lead period (1+L) ). This reduces ordering to match lower demand while the OR backend will still apply service-level z for profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201313) consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 9\u201313) is moderate but full history includes earlier higher weeks; profit >> holding cost (q\u22480.95) so backend service-level-driven defaults are appropriate. I select default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). No new sustained changepoint or delayed shipment to record.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=138, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime earlier (recorded previously) but recent weekly demands (11\u201324 range) are moderate. I use L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples, letting the engine incorporate all historical demand while respecting the observed zero lead-time and current healthy on-hand position to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been low and stable: last 5 concluded demands = [18,24,17,11,18] (mean \u224817.6). On-hand=128, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded lead-times are 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained low-demand regime in May; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match current low demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 in all observed periods, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand has settled much lower (~11\u201324 per week) versus earlier high season; last 5-period average demand \u224816.8 units. To keep replenishment responsive and avoid excess holding, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. This yields a conservative target inventory that balances high profit margin with low holding cost given ample on-hand stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has settled much lower than early 2019 spike; last 5-week demands = [17,11,18,14,9], sustained low demand. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically. I choose L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the current low-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility; this keeps base-stock modest to limit holding cost while preserving service against observed variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent realized weekly demand has been low and stable (last 6 demands: 17,11,18,14,9,9) after earlier higher February levels. On-hand=96, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample versus recent demand, so use a short lead-time assumption and base forecasts on the most recent stable regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime, reducing risk of over-ordering given holding cost is low but inventory is already high.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand has fallen and stayed low since Period 13 (demands: 17,11,18,14,9,9,5). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent concluded evidence. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (7 periods since changepoint) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13 (2019-05-06 to 2019-06-17): avg demand = 11.9 over 7 periods, down sharply from prior recent avg (~65); sustained for 7 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0; no evidence of lost shipments. Demand has been in a lower regime starting Period 13 (sustained ~11.9 avg over 7 periods) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to reflect the lower demand. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length=7) so the OR backend sizes base stock to the reduced demand and lowers holding cost risk versus using older high-demand data.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand: Period19-21 = [5, 37, 65] with a sharp two-week uptick causing a stockout in Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue arrivals to consider. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the very recent uptick (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods \u224835.7) so the backend targets available supply for the immediate higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect increased short-term volatility. These choices prioritize service for the observed recent spike while keeping holding exposure minimal given zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand showed a sharp spike in Period 22 (144) following several low weeks (Periods 18-21: 9,5,37,65). Lead times historically observed are 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). To balance service vs holding cost I use promised lead time (default) and recent demand statistics to adapt to the latest regime: mu_hat uses recent_N=5 (captures last 5 demands = 9,5,37,65,144 -> mean ~52); sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR engine raise the base stock to cover the recent spike while keeping variability estimate localized to the latest regime.

Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick in the last two periods (144,107) after a low-volatility trough; overall recent 5-week mean captures current elevated regime while still reflecting preceding low weeks. No evidence of lead-time deviation (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Choose L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the rapid regime change while limiting noise from older distant history; this raises target base-stock to cover the recent higher demand but keeps variance estimate tied to the same recent window to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=117, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 when orders arrived; use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick in the last 3 periods (P22-P24: 144,107,46) vs the low regime since Period 13 (avg\u224811.9). I treat this as a new short-term higher-demand regime and forecast using the most recent 3 samples to be responsive. Thus: L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture current spike; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given current surge while keeping holding cost sensitivity via backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 22: recent 3-period avg=99 (P22-P24: 144,107,46) up from prior low regime avg\u224811.9 (Periods 13-19); sustained for 3 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): on-hand=101, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime (Periods 22-25) shows a higher level after prior low regime: demands = [144,107,46,80], recent 4-period avg \u224894.3, regime length=4. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 historically. To capture the recent upswing while remaining responsive to fast-changing demand, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (regime_length=4) so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility over the current high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given low holding penalty ($1) versus profit ($19).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time=0 (many orders arrived same period), so use L=default (promised=0). Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 22 (2019-07-08) with recent demands P22-P26 = [144,107,46,80,136]; I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the elevated mean while using recent volatility to avoid overstock; no evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 22 (periods 22-27 demands = 144,107,46,80,136,109; recent 6-pt avg \u2248103.7) versus the low regime in Periods 13-19. On-hand=61, in-transit=0, no evidence of lost shipments (past concludes show lead_time=0 consistently). I set L by calculation of observed lead times (average observed = 0). To capture the confirmed demand regime starting Period 22 I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (regime length=6) so the OR backend builds base_stock from the recent high-demand regime; this balances high service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost by using recent volatility rather than long-horizon diluted statistics.

Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 22-28) show a sustained higher-demand regime (multiple large weekly sales: 144,107,46,80,136,109,151). Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this sustained high-demand regime (P22\u2013P28). This raises the base-stock and captures recent volatility so the OR engine orders enough to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has returned to a higher regime: last 5 concluded weekly demands (P25-P29) = [80,136,109,151,116], mean=118.4 and high variability. On-hand=57, in-transit=0 (coverage << expected weekly demand). Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0), so keep L as default. To capture the recent high-demand regime and current variability, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (reflects (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks \u2248118.4). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward replenishing to meet the resumed high-demand regime while accounting for holding cost via the backend's z* tradeoff.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 22 (weeks 22\u201330 demand sequence: 144,107,46,80,136,109,151,116,107) \u2014 regime length=9. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (observed lead times=0 consistently). I set L to default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and safety stock to the recent volatility and mean, balancing service level against low holding cost ($1). This protects against stockouts given the elevated recent demand while not overstating long-term variability.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has remained in the higher regime since Period 22 (sustained elevated weekly sales); use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current demand level. Choose N=5 (most recent 5 weeks P27-P31: 109,151,116,107,112) to set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat based on the same recent window to reflect current volatility and avoid overweighting older low-demand periods. This raises target base-stock to meet higher service needs while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since late Period 22 (weekly demands P22-P32: 144,107,46,80,136,109,151,116,107,112,103) \u2014 sustained elevated demand vs earlier low regime. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 when orders were placed, so use default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=11 (covers P22\u2013P32). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to service the current high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 25-33) shows a sustained higher regime since Period 25: recent demands P25-P33 = [80,136,109,151,116,107,112,103,147], recent 9-period mean \u2248117 units/week. All observed concluded lead times = 0 (no evidence of longer lead time or lost shipments). I set L=default to use the promised 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 9 samples). For variability I use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated recent demand while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand periods and do not assume unseen delays.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has returned to a higher regime after mid-year volatility; last 4 realized weekly demands (Periods 31-34)=112,103,147,87 (avg\u2248112). On-hand=69, in-transit=0, so coverage is ~0.62 weeks at recent demand \u2014 I prefer to target the short-term recent mean to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost. No evidence shipments are delayed (historical concluded lead times all 0). Therefore: L=default (use promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to anchor forecast to the immediate high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility for service-level sizing. This balances service (reduce stockouts given current high demand) vs holding cost by not inflating the forecast with older low-demand periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly) and no evidence of lost shipments; on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 30-35) averages ~106 with variability; no new sustained regime change detected since prior carry-over insights. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run data, avoiding overreaction to short blips while letting the capped order rule limit order size and control holding costs.

No evidence of lead-time changes\u2014all concluded lead times = 0. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to target (1+L)*recent mean (~100) so base-stock matches current demand regime and avoids excess holding. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand volatility for service-level sizing.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows multiple regime shifts earlier (notably rapid rise around Periods 1\u20135, a downturn Periods 13\u201321, then recovery from Period 22). Recent weekly demand (Periods 31\u201338) is moderate and relatively stable (~63\u2013112), so I forecast using the recent regime to reflect current demand and avoid overreacting to older low/high regimes. No evidence of lost shipments in concluded history (all past orders that were placed concluded with lead_time=0). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 8 concluded weeks (stable recent regime) so the base stock and cap reflect current realized demand and variability while limiting holding cost given low holding penalty ($1/unit). This balances service level vs holding cost and keeps pipeline orders aligned with recent observed demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 25; last 8-week mean \u224885 units/week. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current post-regime demand level and recent volatility so the backend's base-stock balances service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times have been 0 consistently (orders in history arrived same period), so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 36-40) shows moderate demand vs earlier volatility, so set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect current regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand variability. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit (q\u22480.95).

On-hand=60, in-transit=0; need to cover current-period demand. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0).

Recent demand shows moderate weekly demand (~55 units/week over last 5 weeks) with no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change (historical concluded lead_time=0). Use promised lead time (default=0). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5-week average to capture latest regime after summer volatility (reduces influence of older low/high regimes). Keep sigma default to reflect overall observed variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts from recent ~55/wk demand) against low holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many periods with arrived=ordered same period). Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks P39-P43: 46,38,37,85,47) averages ~50.6\u2014no strong new regime change but modest holiday uplift around P42 (85) is one-off. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime and limit influence of older low-demand summer weeks. This balances service (capture current ~50/week) vs low holding cost ($1) by adapting to recent variance while avoiding overreacting to single large spike.
