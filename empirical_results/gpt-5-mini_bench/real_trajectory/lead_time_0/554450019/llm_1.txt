  "rationale": "a) World & product: SKU is superstretch denim skinny jeans. Mid-February has no major demand driver for jeans; demand is typically steady. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly samples show stable mid-Jan demand ~34 (31\u201344) with a single large spike 2019-02-04 = 109. That spike is a one-off in the available history (only one period) so not yet evidence of a sustained regime change. c) Lead time & orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but no prior arrivals observed; actual LT unknown. With promised 0 we may get same-period arrival but cannot rely on confirmed arrival until a conclude message. No in-transit inventory; on-hand=0. d) Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand 0 -> to avoid immediate stockout we should order to cover expected weekly demand plus safety stock for possible short LT or demand variability. e) Order decision: Use conservative forecast anchored to recent stable baseline (~35\u201345) but allow upside for the recent spike. Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1/period), it's profitable to carry modest safety stock. I choose to order 60 units to cover roughly 1\u20132 weeks of elevated demand (covers baseline ~40 plus safety), balancing stockout risk vs holding cost. If future periods show sustained higher demand, increase orders accordingly.",
