Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Historical weekly samples show a recent spike (2019-02-04=109) but limited data (5 weeks). Promised lead time is 0; no evidence yet to adjust. Use default lead time and demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps initial base-stock anchored to full-sample average while avoiding overfitting to the single large recent week given limited history and no sustained regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. History: observed lead time = 0 (Period1 order arrived same period). Recent demand samples: [44,34,109] show a higher recent mean than long-run (62.3 vs 51) driven by a spike on 2019-02-04 and strong sell-through in Period1 (demand 112, sold 105). No evidence of lost shipments. To reduce stockouts given high profit/low holding cost (service target ~95%), I use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N to lean on the last 3 samples to capture the recent uplift, and sigma_hat=default to let the backend compute volatility from all samples.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows actual lead times = 0 (Period1 and Period2 arrivals both reported lead_time 0). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Demand has two recent higher observations (112, 81) but this is only a 2-period rise and not yet a sustained changepoint. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost while awaiting confirmation of a true regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical concluded lead times for SKU 554450019 are consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived with lead_time=0). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost/delayed shipments or demand regime shift (recent demands: P1\u2013P3 sold 105,81,52; earlier samples show variability including a 109 spike). Use default lead time to reflect observed 0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level with holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1462.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weeks (Periods 1-4: demands 112,81,52,79; mean=81) are substantially above the older sample mean (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04 mean=51). All observed lead times in concluded history are 0. To capture the recent higher demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the four most recent demand observations; this raises base stock to meet higher short-term demand while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand periods. This balances service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1) by reacting to the confirmed demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04)=51; recent Periods 1-4 mean (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04)=81 (+59%), sustained over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1378.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime higher: last 4 concluded periods show sustained elevated demand vs. historical baseline. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded orders showed 0 lead. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new regime (most recent 5 demand observations) so the OR backend raises target inventory for higher demand while using recent volatility for safety. This addresses zero in-transit and the need to cover (1+L) periods of demand under the new higher-demand regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods for all arrivals (Periods 1\u20136), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 2\u21925 (recent mean ~81 over 4 periods); use recent_N (N=4) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent demand and tighter recent sample window. This balances higher service needs vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted higher and stabilized (~79\u201389 in Periods 4\u20137); current on-hand=4, in-transit=0 so stock is low versus recent weekly demand (~80). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use observed lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 3 demand samples cover the confirmed higher regime). These parameters steer the OR backend to target a base-stock tuned to the elevated mean while using recent volatility for safety.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted up and been sustained since Period 5 (recent average ~81 vs historical ~51). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. All concluded lead times = 0 historically. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) since observed LT=0 consistently. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime using the last 8 demand observations, so base stock and caps reflect the new demand level and volatility while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand regime increased at Period 5 and sustained (~Periods 5-9 average higher). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent sustained regime length) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples and sigma_hat uses the same recent 5-sample volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding exposure managed given low holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 5 and the last 6 periods (P5\u2013P10 demands = 75,78,89,110,72,61) form a sustained higher regime; use recent_N=6 to capture current mean/volatility. All concluded lead times are 0 \u2192 use calculate to confirm average observed lead time. On-hand 50 + in-transit 0 covers some immediate demand but higher recent mean warrants basing mu_hat/sigma_hat on the last 6 periods to raise target base stock and balance service vs. holding cost (profit=19, holding=1 favors higher service level).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift detected earlier (Period 5) with higher recent demand; recent regime runs from Period 5 onward (7 periods available). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To respond to the higher sustained demand while avoiding excess holding, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the recent regime (last 7 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to the new higher mean and observed volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders placed arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand after the previously recorded regime shift has moderated across many periods (demands in Periods 5\u201312: 75,78,89,110,72,61,49,47) \u2014 no new sustained changepoint detected. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, which balances service level against holding cost while relying on observed stable lead time and long-run demand statistics. Current on-hand (62) provides buffer versus typical weekly demand; no explicit inflation/deflation of forecast is warranted given no new sustained signal and no in-transit stock to reconcile.

Demand history (Periods 1\u201313) mean \u224874.2 units/week. Given stable same-period arrivals and no evidence of sustained new lead-time shifts, use promised lead time (default) and use all-sample demand estimates so the OR backend captures overall demand variability while limiting unnecessary holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals indicate 0). Demand has moderated from the early high regime; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201314) average ~66.9 units, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Given high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.95) we want a high service target but base-stock should reflect the recent lower-volatility regime. L uses promised/default (0). mu_hat uses recent_N to weight the recent regime mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect recent variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand elevated vs early history (carry-over insight from Period 5 shows sustained +59% shift). On-hand=54, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 consistently. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to the observed average lead time and use recent_N (most recent 11 weeks) for demand mean and volatility so the backend targets service for the new regime while limiting excess holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals with observed lead_time=0. On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Demand has varied but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility (use all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so backend applies historical averages and standard deviation; this balances service level given profit/holding cost and avoids overfitting short-term noise.

Recent demand has varied but no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded Period 5 shift; therefore use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation and cap. This balances service level against holding cost given confirmed 0-period deliveries and available inventory.

Previous carry-over noted a demand regime shift at Period 5; no new sustained changepoint since. I therefore use default lead time and default demand uncertainty so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the capped policy manage ordering given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Recent demand has fallen: Periods 17-19 demands = 37, 28, 34 (avg ~33) \u2014 a clear, sustained lower regime over the last 3 periods. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (historical conclude messages all show 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime (focus on last 3 weeks) so the OR backend will target a smaller base stock and reduce holding costs while maintaining service for current demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent realized demand has fallen from spring peaks to lower summer levels: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16-20) = [49, 37, 28, 34, 15], mean \u2248 32.6. No evidence of lead-time deviations (all concluded lead_times=0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and holding risk given high on-hand (56) and no in-transit inventory, balancing service and holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks; the most recent 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 18\u201323: 28,34,15,25,15,10) show a lower recent mean \u2014 I treat this as a new low-demand regime and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime and avoid excess holding cost. This keeps service high while reducing inventory carrying.

Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep default lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use the most recent 5 samples to reflect the current low, low-variance summer demand; this reduces holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time = 0 for many periods) and steady low demand in June\u2013July (~10\u201325/week). On-hand=57, in-transit=0 so no inbound expected this period. I choose L=default to reflect the promised/observed 0-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses the full-sample demand mean and volatility scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given recent low demand and avoids overstock while the backend caps orders. No explicit upward adjustment because recent weeks show sustained lower demand and no lost shipments to compensate.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent weekly demand has fallen to low summer levels (Periods 20-26: 15,25,15,10,10,11,12 with most recent six approx 15,15,10,10,11,12). On-hand=89, in-transit=0 -> ample cover for near-term demand; no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times historically 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to base forecast on the last six weeks; similarly set sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent reduced volatility. These settings reduce target base_stock and orders, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been low (last several periods: 15,25,15,10,10,11,12,20) and on-hand = 69 with in-transit = 0, so current inventory covers multiple weeks. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. No new sustained changepoint detected. Use defaults so OR backend applies promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while keeping service vs. holding tradeoff aligned with profit/holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 \u2014 no evidence of delay. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201328) is much lower and sustained compared with earlier periods (the Feb\u2013Mar spike). To avoid excess holding cost while matching current demand, I set L to default (promised=0) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N=9 covering Periods 20\u201328). sigma_hat also uses recent_N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with observed reduced demand and limits overstock risk given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg demand dropped from historical mean 51 (Periods 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 baseline) to 15.7 (Periods 20\u201328 average = 15.7), a -69% decline, sustained for 9 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 20 (Periods 20\u201329 avg \u224815.7). On-hand=56, in-transit=0; pipeline adequate for near-term given low demand. All concluded lead times = 0 historically. To avoid excess holding cost versus marginal profit, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N=10 (Periods 20\u201329) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock appropriate to the new lower mean and observed variability. This balances service with inventory cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical conclude data show consistently observed lead_time=0 (orders that arrived have arrive=ordered same period) and no prolonged lost shipments; therefore keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 20 (Periods 20\u201330 avg \u224815.7) \u2014 recent low-demand regime length = 11 periods. To reflect the sustained lower demand, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, taking the last 11 observed demand samples (Periods 20\u201330) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the current regime and reduce overstock risk. These settings help the OR backend reduce recommended orders (improving profit \u2212 holding cost tradeoff) while preserving service for the lower observed demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 20 (avg ~15.7) but a single large spike at Period 31 (demand=177) that appears anomalous and not yet sustained. All concluded orders show actual lead time 0. To avoid overreacting to the single spike while allowing some responsiveness, I keep lead time = promised (default), use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to blend long-run demand with recent observations (dampening the one-period spike), and keep sigma_hat at default to avoid overestimating volatility from the one extreme demand point. These choices limit excess inventory while moderately raising target stock to cover potential increased demand without chasing a likely outlier.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting at Period 20 (Periods 20\u201328 avg=15.7) which defines the current regime; more recent spikes (P31=177, P32=97) appear episodic. To reflect the current low-demand regime while still using recent history, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current regime length (Periods 20\u201332, 13 samples). This keeps (1+L)-scaled demand forecast anchored to the observed low regime and captures recent volatility, while L=default preserves the accurate 0-period concluded lead time. With profit $19 and holding $1, this reduces over-ordering risk and holding cost while maintaining service for expected demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp uplift starting Period 31 (demands 177, 97, 331) \u2014 three consecutive high-demand weeks indicating a new high-demand regime. Use L=default (promised lead time=0 consistent with all concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture the new regime (use the last 3 demand samples) so the OR engine raises target base-stock and safety stock to meet the elevated, volatile demand while avoiding excess inventory buildup from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg demand increased from recent low-period avg 15.7 (Periods 20\u201328) to 201.7 (Periods 31\u201333), +~1187%, sustained over 3 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=288, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history arrived same period). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime beginning Period 31 (demands P31\u2013P34 = 177, 97, 331, 110); this is sustained over 4 periods and materially above earlier regime. To make the OR engine target service under the new regime, keep L as default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect the last 4 high-demand weeks' mean and volatility rather than the long-run average.

Demand jumped at Period 31 and has been high for 5 periods (Periods 31\u201335 demands = 177,97,331,110,102; recent mean \u2248163). No overdue shipments. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded history matches promise. Use mu_hat.recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (changepoint at P31; regime length=5) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand. Use sigma_hat.recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility in the high regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=253, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time (default). Demand has clearly shifted since Period 31 (large, volatile weekly demand); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N on the most recent regime starting Period 31 (length 7 weeks: Periods 31\u201337). Thus set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 so the OR backend targets the current higher-demand, higher-volatility regime while L remains default=0. This keeps pipeline short (L=0) and raises the base-stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost given the recent demand surge.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders historically arrived same period). Recent demand regime is the elevated regime starting at Period 31 (large spike sustained through Periods 31\u201338). To capture the current higher-demand regime, keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime (length = 8 periods: P31\u2013P38). Selected N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current high-demand mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given high recent sales and substantial on-hand inventory (202, in-transit 0).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=228, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time=0 consistently (many orders with observed lead_time=0), so use default lead time. Recent demand since the large regime shift at Period 31 is elevated and variable; last 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 34\u201339) show a higher short-term mean (roughly 76.5 units/week) than the long-run baseline. To capture the recent regime while limiting noise, I use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to the current higher-demand regime while accounting for observed volatility. This choice plus L=default balances high service (profit-driven q\u22480.95) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 31 (large spikes at P31\u2013P34, then elevated weekly demand P34\u2013P40: 110,102,52,56,90,49,44). Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 when arrivals occurred, so keep L=default. To capture the post-changepoint demand profile, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 34\u201340) to reflect current elevated mean and volatility while limiting influence of older low-demand regime. This biases the OR base-stock toward higher service (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) without overcommitting to older low-demand data. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=149, in-transit=0, no concluded late arrivals (all historical lead_times=0). Recent demand: large spikes in Sept (Periods 31\u201335) followed by moderate weekly demand in Oct\u2013Nov (Periods 36\u201341). To avoid chasing past spikes while still weighting recent weeks, use EWMA for the (1+L) demand forecast with moderate memory (gamma=0.3). Keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history shows lead_time=0 and no sustained delays. Use default sigma to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances holding cost against service by leaning on recent demand while not overreacting to transient spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 -> use default promised L=0. Recent demand shows a return to higher volatility with last 3 demands (Periods 40\u201342) = [44,35,91]; given prior large regime shifts and recent uptick, I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current short-term mean and volatility for the (1+L)-period demand forecast. These parameters prioritize service for the recent higher demand episodes while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all arrived same-period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows multiple past regime shifts already recorded in carry-over; no new sustained changepoint in the last 3+ periods (recent demands: 44,35,91,22) so use default demand stats rather than recent-window adjustments. Using default L and default mu/sigma lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given no new confirmed regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand regime has varied (large spike in Sept then lower mixed weekly demand); to capture current regime and recent seasonality I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 8 demand observations to balance responsiveness and noise. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep orders conservative given high on-hand inventory and zero pipeline, preserving profit while limiting holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=119, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201345) = [22,14,16] with 3-period average \u224817.3, showing a return to low weekly demand vs earlier spikes. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0). To avoid excess holding given low recent demand and low holding cost sensitivity, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the most recent low-demand regime). This focuses orders on current low demand while keeping safety-stock scaled by recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed arrivals; no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201346) = [44,35,91,22,14,16,19], recent mean \u2248 33.86 and moderate volatility. To reflect the most recent regime and because demand has been lower since Period 40, I use default lead time (promised=0) and recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility over the review+lead window. This balances high service target (profit/total cost \u2192 q\u22480.95) with current lower demand to avoid excess holding given On-hand=100.
