Recent demand (Periods 41\u201344) = [17,113,51,57], 4-week average \u224859.5; last 4 periods show no sustained upward shift and current season (mid-December) is off-peak for swim bottoms. OR recommendation (469) is driven by high-summer historical spikes and the high profit/low holding cost fractile, so it overestimates current demand. Final strategy: place 0 units. Rationale: with lead_time=0 we only need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand now; expected demand \u224860 and on-hand 92 already covers this plus a modest buffer, so ordering would unnecessarily increase holding cost and risk overstock. No evidence of lost shipments or new regime shifts requiring replenishment.",

Product is swimwear in late December (off-season), so calendar + recent data point to low near-term demand.
