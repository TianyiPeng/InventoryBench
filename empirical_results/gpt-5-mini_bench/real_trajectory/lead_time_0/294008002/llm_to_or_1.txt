Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~51.2 units/week and std ~6.57. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time is 0 and no contrary observations exist, so keep L as default. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to reflect the observed stable recent history and avoid overfitting given only 5 samples. This balances service level versus holding cost under symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: Period 1 order of 52 arrived same period and demand in P1 exceeded supply (sold 52, lost sales likely). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue arrivals. Use promised/default lead time (0) because concluded evidence confirms same-period arrivals. Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to leverage historical weekly mean (~51.2) and variance; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders from P1 and P2 both arrived in-period (arrived same period as ordered), confirming actual lead time = 0. Recent realized demand (66, 88) exceeds older sample mean (51.2) but is only two periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Promised lead time = 0 is supported by concluded arrivals, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to avoid overreacting to a brief spike; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding so target q=0.5.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). History shows orders from P1\u2013P3 all arrived same period (confirmed lead time = 0 in P2 conclude). Recent weekly demands: [43,55,46,53,59], mean=51.2, no clear regime shift or increased volatility. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we need replenishment based on standard forecasts. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock = (1+L)*mean and default sigma scaling; this balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments beyond the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4) is substantially higher than the older Jan samples (recent: 66,88,70,77 vs older mean ~51). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Observed lead time confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent upward regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N N=4) so the OR backend forecasts based on the higher recent mean and volatility, improving service while the holding cost equals profit ($1) so service is prioritized but not overstocked. Carry-over insight left empty because no new sustained pattern beyond already-confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across P1\u2013P5). Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u20135 sells: 66,88,70,77,64) is substantially above the older sample series (43\u201359), indicating a sustained higher demand regime. I set L to default to rely on the promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, higher demand mean across the last 5 realized periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the elevated demand while the zero lead time minimizes pipeline uncertainty; using recent data avoids understocking given the clear upward shift. No overdue shipments detected (arrivals have been timely).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 in all concluded orders) and demand over the last 6 periods: [66,88,70,77,64,75] with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. No overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time of 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (stable weekly demand ~73), which balances service (captures recent mean) vs holding cost (avoids inflating forecast with older low January samples).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20137) is consistently higher (~66,88,70,77,64,75,93) than the older sample mean (~51.2), indicating a sustained upward regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish immediately. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, set demand estimates using the most recent 7 periods (regime length=7). This raises target base-stock to favor service (profit and stockouts equal) while acknowledging holding cost; sigm\xe2 uses same recent window to reflect current variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P8 all arrived same period). Demand samples (weeks in history) are stationary with no recent changepoint. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead time = 0, so set L via calculate to reflect observed history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to leverage full-sample estimates; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P10) consistently show arrivals same period => actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has been variable (P1\u2013P10 demands: 66,88,70,77,64,75,93,82,56,37) but no sustained regime shift. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full-sample estimates and lets the OR engine apply its base-stock formula to balance service vs. holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for next period. Historical demand has shifted above the older sample mean: recent 5-period demands (P7-P11) = [93,82,56,37,108], mean=75.2, indicating a higher recent regime than the early 2019 sample mean (~51.2). Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent higher mean and volatility (captures short-term regime change). This pushes the backend base_stock to match recent demand while sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock; with profit=holding the backend's service quantile will be 0.5, so using recent stats balances service vs holding for current higher-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=0 (orders have arrived same period each conclude). Use promised/default lead time=0. Demand history (Jan\u2013Feb samples mean\u224851.2) is limited but stable; with profit=holding the critical fractile q=0.5 so z*=0 and base-stock equals mu_hat. Choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a balanced service-level (50%) while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised/observed lead time of 0. Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~51.2 units/week; no sustained regime change detected in recent periods despite variability. Set L to default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock target that balances the equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5) without overreacting to short-term swings or risking lost-shipment misinference.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased: Periods 11-14 demands = [108,100,91,121] (avg=105). Use default lead time (promised 0; prior conclude confirmed LT=0). For demand I use recent_N over last 4 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=4). Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base_stock to meet higher short-term demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand increased from ~72 (Periods 1-10 avg \u224872) to 105 (Periods 11-14 avg=105, +46%)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently (P1\u2013P15 arrivals occurred same period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 11: avg demand P1\u2013P10 \u224872; P11\u2013P15 avg \u2248105 (+46%). I set L by calculating observed lead times (returns 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher post-changepoint mean (Periods 11\u201315) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base stock to the new higher demand while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P16 arrived same period). Demand shifted up starting Period 11 (Periods 11\u201316 demands = 108,100,91,121,126,140; sustained higher regime). I therefore keep L at default (promised 0) and set demand estimates using the recent higher-demand regime: use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 11\u201316) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the sustained higher mean and observed variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by focusing forecasts on the confirmed elevated regime rather than diluting with older lower-demand data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent history shows confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 11 (periods 11\u201317 average \u2248105 vs earlier \u224872). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; expect current period demand to follow the higher regime so replenish to cover (1+L) periods of that regime. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201317). For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N N=7 so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent variability and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 11 (avg ~105 over P11-14, continued high sales through P18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead time. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 in history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 11-18) to capture the new higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the regime shift and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 11 (higher mean \u2248105). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover this higher regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0). For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11\u201319: 9 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base stock aligned with the confirmed higher demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand data, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use calculated average lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (Periods 11-20). These choices direct the OR backend to target a base stock reflecting the higher recent mean while sizing safety stock from recent volatility; using recent_N helps balance service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

No shipments overdue. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the post-Period-11 higher-demand regime (regime length = Periods 11\u201321 = 11 samples). This biases the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility toward the current higher-demand regime, improving service while limiting excess holdings given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods, e.g., P1..P22 arrivals same period). Demand regime increased starting Period 11 (Periods 11-22 show persistently higher weekly demand vs. Periods 1-10). To capture the current higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime samples (last 12 concluded weeks, P11-P22). This keeps the OR backend's forecast focused on the sustained higher mean/volatility and avoids understocking given zero observed lead time and no in-transit units.

294008002: ordered=65, arrived=65 units (ordered on Period 24, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=106, demand=39, sold=39, ending on-hand inventory=67

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Historical concluded data show actual lead time = 0 (consistent every period). Demand regime shift at Period 11 raised weekly demand from ~72 to ~105; recent regime spans Periods 11\u201324 (14 samples). On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so current coverage is < one typical week of the new regime. Use L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to target the new higher regime (backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 14 samples)); sigma_hat also recent_N N=14 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to match sustained higher demand while sigma from the same window keeps safety buffer aligned with recent variability, balancing service (avoid stockouts) vs holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows persistent zero actual lead time (orders previously concluded arrived same period) and a sustained demand regime shift upward around Period 11 (already recorded). Current on-hand=27, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Profit=Holding => critical fractile 0.5 so base-stock equals demand mean; I will use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it size orders to cover one-period demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 11 (higher mean ~105). Current on-hand=38, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To capture the post-changepoint demand while limiting holding costs (profit=holding cost), I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and base the demand forecast on the most recent data: recent_N=10 samples to reflect the new regime without overfitting older low-demand periods. I also set sigma_hat based on the same recent window to align safety stock with current volatility. These choices give the OR engine a demand estimate focused on the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumptions truthful to observed arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated from the mid-100s earlier in the year to ~55\u201360 over the last 5 weeks (Periods 23-27: 68,39,74,44,65; 5-week mean \u224858). Lead time has been reliably 0 historically. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use a recent demand estimate based on the last 5 samples (captures the current lower regime since late July) and match sigma to the same window so the backend computes a base-stock appropriate for current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent downshift while the low promised lead time allows same-period replenishment; on-hand + pipeline (19) will be compared by the OR engine against the computed base_stock to decide order quantity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 P29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift up around Period 11 (recorded previously), but recent weeks show lower/variable sales. To be responsive to the most recent pattern while accounting for the confirmed zero lead time, I set L=default. I use mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the last 5 observed demands (captures recent downward/variable trend) and keep sigma_hat=default so the backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (many periods). Demand shows a sustained higher regime around Periods 11-19, but the last 5 observed demands (Periods 25-29 = 74,44,65,64,44) average ~58, indicating a recent downward/seasonal pullback. I therefore use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime; sigma also set recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock responsive to current lower demand while the OR backend still accounts for service level via its z-calculation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand regime (Periods 11-30) elevated vs Periods 1-10; historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0. On-hand=34, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover this period's demand after decision. I set L to calculate (backend will confirm actual observed lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (Periods 11-30 = 20 samples) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This biases base_stock toward the new, higher mean while keeping variability estimated from the same window, improving service during the confirmed higher-demand regime without relying on older low-demand data.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across many concluded periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime confirmed earlier (Periods 11-15). Current on-hand=46, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To keep the OR engine simple and aligned with observed lead time, use promised/default lead time. Use default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost under equal profit/holding ($1/$1, q=0.5). No explicit upward adjustments are needed now given stable 0 lead time and no new sustained demand signal since the prior regime change.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 28-32 = 64,44,25,41,60) is lower than the earlier high-regime avg (Periods 11-14 ~105). To avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), I bias the forecast to the recent 5-week regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock sized to recent demand and reduces holding risk while allowing service for the immediate period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-day arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed many periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime that began around Period 11. Recent demand (Periods 26-33 = 44,65,64,44,25,41,60,66) shows a moderate mean ~51 and continued variability. I therefore keep lead time at default (promised 0). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the current late-summer regime; N=8 (last 8 weeks) balances recency and sample size. Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices provide the OR backend an up-to-date (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability so the base-stock balances service level versus holding cost under the observed zero lead time.

Demand shows a recent downshift versus mid-year peak; last 10 periods (P25-34) average demand \u224855 with notable volatility and the most recent 5 weeks averaging \u224841. To adapt to the recent lower regime while remaining responsive to variability, I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and std (captures the last 10 samples to reflect recent regime). Keep L as default (promised 0, confirmed by history). These choices reduce target base-stock to match the recent lower demand while preserving forecast volatility for service-level tradeoff.

Recent demand (Periods 28-35) is lower than the earlier elevated regime (Periods 11-19); I therefore target the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 8 weeks (Periods 28\u201335). This reduces target base-stock compared with using the earlier high-demand mean and balances service vs holding cost given current low demand and zero lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (many periods, e.g., P1\u2192P36 arrivals same-period), so set L by calculation of observed lead times. Demand history shows the previously recorded regime shift (higher mean from Period 11 onward) but no new changepoint in recent weeks. Use default demand/volatility methods so backend uses full-sample statistics adjusted by the computed L. This balances service (use observed short lead time) vs holding cost given modest on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in concludes). Recent demand has fallen sharply since late Sep \u2014 last 8 observed weekly demands (Periods 31-37) are low (41,60,66,16,18,13,10 with several very small weeks). I therefore keep L at promised (default=0) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime to avoid overstock. Chose recent_N with N=8 to capture the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility. This reduces base_stock and limits holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals historically show lead time 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments), so keep L as promised (default). Recent history shows a past sustained demand regime increase (recorded previously), but no new changepoint in the last periods (demand low and stable weeks 34\u201338). To let the OR backend use the full sample set and its internal service-level formula, select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and current moderate on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple arrivals same-period). Recent demand (Periods 35-39 = 18,13,10,9,11) is much lower than mid-year peak; I use a recent mean to reflect the lower current regime. Set L=default to trust promised/observed 0-day lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u224812.2 units, aligning base-stock with current low demand and q=0.5 (no safety-upward bias). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent low volatility (~3.6 units). This reduces excess holding while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has fallen since early Oct: Periods 35-40 demands = [18,13,10,9,11,12], avg \u2248 12. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Lead time historically confirmed as 0; retain promised lead time. To avoid excess holding cost into late-Nov, set mu_hat using a recent-window forecast (more weight to current low-demand regime) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps base-stock conservative (lower orders) while preserving service for the current low-demand weeks.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Recent weekly demand has fallen sharply since early Oct: Periods 35-41 demands = [18,13,10,9,11,12,8] (avg \u2248 11.3 over last 7). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and a clear recent low-demand regime, I reduce forecast to reflect the most recent behavior. Set L=default (promised=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples, capturing the new lower demand regime and avoiding excess holding cost. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture recent lower volatility. These choices trade a slightly higher stockout risk against holding cost savings given sustained low demand over 7 periods.

With low pipeline and current on-hand covering only a short horizon, use default lead-time and demand estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over full history; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each). Default methods let the backend compute base-stock and cap using all observed demand data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has been much lower since Period 35 (week of 2019/10/07) and the last 9 periods (P35\u2013P43) show a sustained low regime (avg \u224812.7). To reflect the current low-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 9 samples. This keeps target base_stock aligned to the new low-demand regime, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service under current demand.

To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I set L=default (promised 0), use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the 10-period low-demand regime\u2014this reduces target base stock and holding costs while preserving service under current demand.
