Demand analysis: recent weekly sales (65,117,162,118,146) average = 121.6 units/week with modest upward variability; no 3+ period sustained regime shift detected. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead_time=0 but no concluded arrivals yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0); actual lead time unknown and shipments can be lost/delayed. Risk posture: profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding cost ($1/period), so it's acceptable to carry modest safety stock.

Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=57, in-transit=0, with lead_time=0 we must order to cover this period's demand only. Holding cost is low ($1/unit) vs profit $19/unit, so prefer to satisfy demand rather than risk lost sales. Order logic: target \u2248 expected demand (160) minus on-hand (57) = 103 \u2192 place 100 units (round to a practical lot) to meet probable demand while limiting excess holding.",
