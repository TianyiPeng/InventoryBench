Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 108775044 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals; only historical weekly demand samples available (2019-01-07..2019-02-04: [162,142,115,133,118], mean=134). Promised lead time is 0 and no observed lead-time delays to infer otherwise, so keep L as default. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean of all samples => 1*134) and default volatility (sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). Given high profit vs low holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile \u22480.95), defaults provide a high service level while avoiding speculative changes without evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows Period1 order (166) arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Using lead-time inference via observed samples supports keeping lead time at observed average. Demand history (five weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb) shows stable weekly demand ~134 mean. Choose L=calculate to use observed lead times; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to limited data or a single small on-hand position.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived with lead_time=0 (two observations). No sustained (>3 periods) demand or lead-time regime change detected; demand history is limited and recent spike (Period 2 demand=244) is not yet persistent. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost conservatively.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived with lead_time=0 and no in-transit stock; on-hand=51. Historical demand samples (5 weeks) average ~134 units/week. No evidence of demand regime shift or delayed/lost shipments. Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0), use default demand forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full-sample stability, and default sigma to capture historical volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock anchored to observed demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2756.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical weekly sample mean=134 (samples: 162,142,115,133,118). Recent concluded periods show arrivals with lead_time=0 each time (P1-P4), so actual lead time appears 0. Demand has been volatile but no clear sustained regime shift; using default demand estimates lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std given confirmed L=0.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1,P2,P3,P4 all arrived in same period; concluded messages P1-P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows weekly demand samples (157,244,175,149,138) and on-hand=81, in-transit=0. Prior periods confirmed actual lead time = 0. With same-period arrivals and no sustained regime shift (demand is volatile but not consistently elevated or depressed for 3+ periods), use baseline statistics so the OR engine can compute base_stock using full-sample mean/variance. Using default L/mu/sigma lets the backend apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent on-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1-P6): 157,244,175,149,138,156 -> recent mean \u2248169.5 and moderate dispersion. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history shows consistent 0 actual lead time; use default L to keep backend assumption. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the immediate six-week demand regime and capture recent elevated demand (mean \u2248169.5 \xd7 (1+L)). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago Jan samples. This balances service (captures recent higher demand) vs holding cost by avoiding inflation from older data.

Current on-hand=51, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no evidence of a demand regime shift, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a spike in Period 8 (312) after several mid-range weeks (149,138,156,182). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows consistent 0 actual lead time; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. To capture the recent regime (last 5 periods: Periods 4-8) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets inventory for the higher recent demand while limiting long-tail holding cost exposure. This balances service for the demand spike versus holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand shows increased volatility (notably Period 8 demand=312) but arrivals have been reliable and lead time observed = 0 in concluded history. On-hand=99, in-transit=0 so available coverage is limited for this week. I set L by calculating average observed lead time (reflects confirmed 0). I use default demand estimates (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (backend: sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full historical sample set while preserving responsiveness to the observed 0 lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (notably P8=312, P9=207, P10=225) but no missing or delayed arrivals; on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Prior concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed same-period arrivals and use full-sample demand stats for stability, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level for recent spikes while avoiding overfitting to a single high week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated and more variable demand (last 5 demands: 182,312,207,225,273; mean\u2248239.8) vs earlier history. No overdue shipments; prior conclude messages confirm lead time=0. To prioritize service while controlling holding cost, keep L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base stock and caps appropriately.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1-12). Demand seed samples (Jan 2019) have mean=134; using conservative/default estimation avoids overreacting to recent spikes without 3+ period confirmation. Set L to promised (0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent realized demand (Periods 8-13 = 312,207,225,273,270,199) is substantially above the historical Jan samples (mean=134), indicating a sustained upward demand regime starting around Period 8. On-hand=85, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new regime (Periods 8\u201313) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the base stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping holding elevated only as needed, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P14) shows frequent same-period arrivals and demand volatility (weekly sold range ~149\u2013312). Current inventory: on-hand=55, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set lead time to be inferred from observed conclusions (calculate) which confirms 0 periods. For forecasting I use the default demand estimator (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend uses the full historical sample to compute base_stock and cap. This balances service (captures observed variability) against holding cost given modest holding penalty ($1/unit). No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed because concluded messages show consistent 0 lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P15 all arrived same period). On-hand=21, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history is stable with regular weekly variability. I select default lead time (use promised 0), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage full-sample demand estimate, and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes a base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost using the full historical demand distribution.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weekly demand has settled at a higher regime (~200\u2013270) since early April vs. much lower Jan\u2013Feb levels. On-hand=30, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) weeks. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded arrivals were same-period); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times (will be 0). To capture the demand regime shift, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent regime: I choose N=9 (covers Periods 8\u201316 where demand rose and remained elevated). This balances service (captures higher mean) while keeping volatility estimate recent for the backend's capped ordering policy.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). SKU 108775044 (strap top). On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201317) show every order arriving in the same period\u2014lead time consistently observed as 0. No evidence of lost shipments. Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit implies high service level desired. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies its full-sample mean and std over the (1+L) review+lead window.

No overdue or lost shipments observed. I retain promised lead time (0) and use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7long-run mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level using full sample history rather than overfitting recent volatility or a short window.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent on-hand=211, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-19) consistently show arrivals same period => actual lead time = 0. Demand history shows recent weeks with elevated demand (~200s) vs early Jan samples; however confirmation of a persistent new regime requires 3+ periods of sustained shift relative to the full sample set. To remain conservative and let the OR engine blend historical variability, I use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders responsive (same-period arrivals) while letting the backend's capped policy limit excessive orders and balancing service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weekly demand has declined from ~263 (P16) to 61 (P20); on-hand=234, in-transit=0. Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0, so use default L to let backend assume same-period arrivals. To reflect the recent downward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus forecast and volatility on the last five demands (P16\u2013P20). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given high on-hand inventory.

Current on-hand=263, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has fallen sharply (Periods 18-21 demands: 92,85,61,27) indicating a downshift from earlier months. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and confirmed 0 LT, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample, letting it naturally reduce order quantities based on the full historical distribution while respecting promised lead time=0.

Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To avoid excess holding while reflecting the new lower-demand regime, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent regime (Periods 17-22, length=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect lower current demand and reduced variability, improving inventory tilt toward holding-cost sensitivity.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=241, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has fallen to ~18\u201327 units (Periods 21-24) after much higher spring demand. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 0. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime (only ~4 low-demand weeks), so use promised/default estimators. Default L keeps lead time=promised (0) which matches observed concluded arrivals; default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This balances service (profit $19 >> holding $1) by letting the backend set safety stock from historical variance while avoiding manual overreaction to the recent short dip.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and demand has declined since spring into summer (recent weeks: demands ~27,21,19,18,27). On-hand = 275, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample coverage for near-term demand. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this leverages the long-run demand signal while the confirmed L=0 lets the optimizer place same-period replenishment to balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to ~20 units/week (last 5 demands: 21,19,18,27,16; mean\u224820.2), so use a short recent window to reflect the lower summer regime.

Recent weekly demand has fallen sharply since early June (Period 18 onward: demands = [92,85,61,27,21,19,18,27,16,12]); current regime average is much lower than earlier spring peak. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=10 (captures Period 18-27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current lower mean and reduced volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=262, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen sharply and stayed low since Period 18. Keep L at default (promised = 0) consistent with confirmed zero lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to reflect the new low-demand regime (use last 11 samples) so the OR base-stock targets lower replenishment and avoids excess holding. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture reduced volatility in the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 18: avg demand before P18 (Periods 1-17) = 217.35 units/week vs recent avg (Periods 18-28) = 35.36 units/week (\u221283.7%), sustained for 11 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained demand collapse beginning Period 18 (avg Periods 1-17 >> Periods 18-28) and confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time = 0). On-hand = 255, in-transit = 0. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 18\u201329 comprise a sustained low-demand regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples to align target base-stock to the new lower demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=12 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability in the low-demand regime. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service under the new regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 18 (orders/demand much lower than earlier weeks); on-hand=249, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L = promised (default). To reflect the new low-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=13 periods, P18\u2013P30) so the (1+L) demand forecast is driven by current low baseline. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=13) to capture recent low volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to lower demand while the high profit/low holding cost ratio (q\u22480.95) yields a high service target; using recent samples prevents overstock given the sustained demand drop and zero observed in-transit.

Demand regime dropped starting Period 18 and has remained low through Period 31 (recent avg \u224835.4 units/week). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep L at promised (default). Forecast demand using recent regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 (Periods 18-31) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the low regime. Use recent_N N=14 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

On-hand=242, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand, so avoid overstating demand. Lead time has been observed as 0 historically and remains so in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. For demand forecasting use a recent_N estimate capturing the post-P18 regime: N=15 (Periods 18\u201332) \u2014 recent mean \u224827.3 units/week, which the backend will scale by (1+L). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to capture reduced volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Demand has undergone a sustained drop beginning Period 18 (avg before P18 much higher vs recent low weekly demand). On-hand = 239, in-transit = 0; current inventory already covers many weeks of the lower demand, so avoid inflating forecasts from pre-change data. Lead times historically observed are 0 (consistent concluded arrivals). I set L using observed lead times to reflect reality. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (Periods 18 onward, regime length 16) so the OR backend targets (L+1)-period demand at the current lower level and reduces excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained ~3\u201392 units/week, recent mostly single digits); on-hand=229, in-transit=0 so current inventory comfortably covers expected low demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To align the OR forecast with the new low-demand regime, I use recent_N methods (capture last 18 post-changepoint samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility; L set via calculate to reflect observed lead times (0). This reduces unnecessary ordering and holding cost while preserving service for the lower-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (recent avg ~35/week and single-digit weekly demand in many recent periods). On-hand = 224, in-transit = 0 \u2192 ample cover vs expected demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded messages (P1\u2013P36). I set L to calculate (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to avoid inflating forecast with earlier high-demand history: mu_hat recent_N N=19 (covers Periods 18\u201336). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=19 to reflect reduced variability. These settings keep target base-stock small relative to old regime but stable, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=221, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (P1\u2013P37) confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand regime dropped sharply starting P18 and has remained low through P37. I set L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (periods 18\u201337) to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples) and reduce forecast bias from earlier high-demand periods. Sigma set to recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices prevent over-ordering given high on-hand inventory and low sustained demand, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained ~11+ weeks low demand) and on-hand is 213 with zero in-transit; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times are 0, so use default lead time. To capture the sustained low-demand regime, set demand estimates using the most recent regime data: use recent_N on the last 20 weeks (regime length >=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock to low current demand and avoids excess holding cost. This keeps orders small given high service quantile (q=0.95) while preventing unnecessary inventory buildup.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 18 (weekly demand dropped from ~217 to ~35 and remained low through Period 39). On-hand = 209, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments observed (concluded lead times consistently 0). To reflect confirmed short lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the new low-demand regime, use recent_N over the most recent stable regime (use a large N up to the 20-period cap) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the low-demand samples, avoiding overstock while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=205, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 for many periods. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 18 (much lower demand since P18). To reflect the recent low-demand regime while still using observed lead-time evidence, I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (will be 0) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures sustained low-demand behavior). This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost given large on-hand inventory and low demand, while preserving service by matching recent demand patterns.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (recent avg \u224835 units/week) and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals). On-hand =202, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to current low demand, so we should size forecasts from the recent low-demand regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use last 20 weeks of demand to estimate mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window). This biases orders toward lower replenishment, reducing holding cost while preserving service level under current regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 18 (avg \u224835/week) and no in-transit inventory (on-hand=192, pipeline=0). Promised lead time remains 0 and historically confirmed as 0 (no recent evidence to change). To align forecasts with the low-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute base-stock and caps using recent variability, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime data. Chosen N=20 (regime length since P18 is 25, cap at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the last 20 weeks of observed demand; L=default keeps promised lead time=0. This keeps orders conservative given high on-hand inventory and low ongoing demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Demand regime permanently shifted down starting Period 18 (sustained low weekly demand since then). On-hand=190, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for current low demand but holding cost applies. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will be computed from recent data: use the last 20 weeks (cap=20) to capture the post-changepoint behavior and reduce target base-stock and safety stock relative to long-run averages.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained, large demand drop starting Period 18 (confirmed in carry-over): recent weekly demand is low (~single- to low-double digits) for many periods. On-hand = 186, in-transit = 0, so current inventory covers many weeks at current demand; no overdue arrivals. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (historically confirmed as 0 in earlier carry-over). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the low-demand regime (use last 20 observed weeks to avoid contamination from the high-demand pre-Period-18 regime). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices bias orders toward the low post-change demand, reducing holding costs while preserving service given the confirmed regime shift and ample on-hand stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 18 (sustained ~35 units/week); on-hand=179, in-transit=0 so ample cover. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Period 5 evidence) and no concluded messages indicate longer LT. I set L=default to use promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-change low-demand regime (use last 20 weeks within the confirmed low regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to the current low mean and volatility, avoiding excess purchases while preserving service level.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Demand collapsed starting Period 18 and has remained low through Period 46 (recent weeks mostly single-digit sales). On-hand=168, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (concluded history P1\u2013P5). I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (long enough to reflect the new regime but capped at 20). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices keep base_stock tight to recent low demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the new low-demand regime.
