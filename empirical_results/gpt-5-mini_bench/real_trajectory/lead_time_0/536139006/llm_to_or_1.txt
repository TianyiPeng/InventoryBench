Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 536139006 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and five recent weekly demand samples (mean ~132). No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std calculations, balancing service level with holding cost without overreacting to noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (weeks in history) have mean ~132.4 units. Current inventory: on-hand 63, in-transit 0; no overdue shipments. Period 1 conclude shows orders placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). I use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the forecast anchored to historical weekly demand while the base-stock policy (with backend cap) balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost given the low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two consecutive orders (P1,P2) arrived with lead_time=0; demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~132.4. On-hand=50, in-transit=0. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock target that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost given current steady demand observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1524.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1-3) are all 0 periods, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 sales = 82,110,84; mean=92) is ~30% below the historical sample mean (132.4). On-hand=72, in-transit=0; with lower recent demand I set mu_hat using recent_N to reflect the new lower regime and reduce ordering; sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture recent volatility. This balances service (cover current period demand plus review) against holding cost given the apparent drop in sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Periods 1-3, 2019/2/11-2019/2/25): recent mean=92 vs historical mean=132.4 (\u221230%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $1842.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has dropped vs historical (carry-over: recent mean=92 vs historical=132.4, sustained 3 periods). On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm L=0. To adapt to the sustained lower-demand regime, set demand estimates using the most recent 3 periods (regime length=3) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect reduced variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1901.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained lower-demand regime in the most recent 3 weeks (demands: 84,98,101) vs longer-run samples. On-hand=18, in-transit=0 so available supply is low relative to recent demand. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the confirmed recent regime, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases service on the observed lower-but-stable demand while avoiding overstock if the shift persists. No missing shipments to account for.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand has settled below historical Jan mean (last 6 demands: 82,110,84,98,101,93 \u2192 lower regime). On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Actual concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed periods, so use promised/default lead time. To adapt to the lower recent-demand regime I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent behavior while meeting the N selection rules). This balances service (targeting demand-driven base stock) against holding cost by reflecting the lower recent mean and realized volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). All observed lead times = 0 (arrivals in conclude messages). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 4-7: 98,101,93,100) forms a lower, sustained regime vs historical average (~132). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because observed lead times are consistently 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower-demand regime (use last 4 periods). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the confirmed lower demand pattern.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early-2019 mean (~132) has given way to a lower, sustained demand regime (recent samples ~82\u2013117). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0; use promised/default lead time. Use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the lower recent regime (use last 8 samples to include all observed periods 1\u20138). Use recent_N for volatility to reflect recent variability. These settings let the OR backend size base stock to recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost given low on-hand and confirmed low mean demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted down from historical Jan mean (~132) to a sustained lower regime (~92) beginning Periods 1\u20133 and persisting through Period 9. On-hand=27, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; upcoming demand must be covered by on-hand plus any order (orders placed now arrive same period per promised L=0). I set L=default since concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 observed demand samples (Periods 1\u20139) so the base-stock and cap are computed from the current regime mean and volatility rather than the older higher historical Jan samples. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service via the backend's service-level mapping (profit vs holding cost).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand has settled lower since Period 4 (sustained drop); latest demands (P4-P10) form a lower regime. On-hand=40, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead times observed in concluded history are 0 consistently. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, use recent_N for demand estimates (focus on the last regime samples) and calculate lead time from observed history. This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 (all periods). Recent demand has softened: last 3 concluded demands = [91,77,64], a sustained 3-period downshift versus earlier weeks. I keep L = default (promised lead time 0) since all observed lead times = 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a smaller base-stock and reduces holding cost while retaining service. This balances profit per unit ($19) against holding cost ($1) given the recent demand drop and current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downshift confirmed: Periods 9-11 average demand = 77.3 (91,77,64) sustained 3 periods, ~-20% vs prior periods

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all arrivals same period ordered). Recent demand has downshift signals (Periods 9-11 avg ~77; Period 12 demand=98 but inventory now low). To keep service while limiting holdings, set L using observed lead times (average=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to the most recent regime and capture current lower demand pattern over the last 3 demand periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P13 all show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been lower than early historical (carry-over indicated a downshift around Periods 9\u201311). To lean on most recent demand regime while using observed LT=0, I set L via calculated average of observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest 5 observed weekly demands and reduce exposure to the earlier higher regime; same for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward current lower demand, reducing holding costs while preserving service under the OR backend's capped policy.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has downshifted vs historical Jan samples (historical mean ~132). Last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 10-14 = 77,64,98,73,83) average \u224879, showing a sustained lower regime with moderate variability. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. To reflect the lower recent mean while keeping the backend's (1+L) aggregation, I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to bias the forecast toward the recent lower demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability. This reduces overstock risk while allowing the OR engine to compute a service-oriented base stock given profit vs holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times = 0 (all concluded arrivals same period) so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 13-15 = 73,83,94; mean=83.3) remains materially below early historical mean (~132), consistent with prior confirmed downshift; I therefore forecast using the most recent 3-week regime. Set L=default to reflect observed 0-period lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the current low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk given high service quantile (q=0.95) and low holding cost. No in-transit arrivals expected (none overdue), so orders should be sized to replenish from on-hand=6 to the backend base-stock target derived from the recent regime.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has trended down vs early history (recent weeks avg lower); to react to the lower recent regime while still smoothing noise I use a 5-period recent estimate for demand mean and volatility. L set to promised (default=0) because observed arrivals show lead_time=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower demand regime and reduce excess holding costs while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Observed lead times across concluded history are consistently 0 periods. Demand has trended down vs early history; most recent 3 periods (P15-P17 = 94,72,43) show a lower mean. I set L based on observed history (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest downshift without overreacting to older, higher-demand weeks. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the backend to lower base-stock and cap, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand regime.

Recent demand has downshifted and become lower/less stable versus early samples, so I use a short recent window to forecast (capturing the lower regime). This keeps target base-stock modest to avoid holding cost while preserving service.

To capture the recent downshift while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed history, select L=default (promised=0), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets the (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given current low demand.

Lead times historically confirmed as 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). To reflect the sustained lower demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 weeks). Keep L as default (promised = 0) since concluded history shows 0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero. Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly been 0 periods. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21) where the downshift is evident; this gives a (1+L)-period demand forecast \u224838.4. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 to capture current variability. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service for the lower recent demand environment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P22 all arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has settled much lower since Period 17 (six periods of low weekly demand); to capture this regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent 6 periods so the OR backend targets a smaller base-stock and reduces holding costs while preserving service. No overdue shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Periods 17-22 average demand = 36.5 (43,47,35,27,40,27) vs prior recent avg ~77 (\u221253%), sustained 6 periods

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 17 (Periods 17-23 avg=36.5, 7 periods). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; risk of stockout this period is high. Promised lead time historic observations are all 0, so keep L=default. To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime, set mu_hat based on the most recent regime (recent_N with N=7, covering Periods 17-23). Volatility also reduced in this regime, so set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7. These choices align the backend base-stock to current lower mean and lower variability, reducing excess holding while maintaining service given limited inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 17 (sustained: Periods 17-24), so I use recent data to forecast. On-hand=21, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Promised lead time=0 has been confirmed by concluded arrivals. Set L=default to use promised lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (regime length Periods 17-24 = 8) so the OR backend targets service for the new lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 17 (Periods 17-25, 9 periods) \u2014 sustained lower mean vs earlier history; therefore I use a recent-window estimate covering this regime. Set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime_length=9 \u2192 N=9). This keeps target base-stock aligned to current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given high profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed are all 0 \u2192 use default promised L=0. Recent demand shows a modest rebound since Period 23 low; last 5 demands (P22-P26) = [27,48,32,44,58], mean\u224841.8. To capture the recent regime while remaining data-driven, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias inventory toward the recent higher demand while keeping holding cost exposure limited (profit/holding implies moderate service target).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 historically. Recent demand has trended up from the low regime around Periods 17-22 (avg ~36.5) toward higher recent values (Periods 24-27 demands = 32,44,58,91; last 5 demands 48,32,44,58,91 avg \u2248 54.6), so I bias the forecast to recent weeks to capture this pickup while keeping lead time at promised 0. I choose recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime and short review+lead window; this balances service level (capture recent demand rise) against holding cost given zero on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical actual lead time observed = 0 in all concluded periods. Recent demand (Periods 26-28 = 58,91,82) is above the low midsummer regime and appears elevated; to be responsive to this recent uptick while keeping holding costs low, I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (captures the latest trend). L kept as default (promised=0) since concluded history confirms lead time=0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time historically 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0), so use default L. To capture the recent lower demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 samples) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current demand levels while keeping variability tied to recent history. This reduces overstock risk given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$19/unit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore keep L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime observed since Period 23 and avoid overstock; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward recent demand, balancing service level (profit $19/unit) against holding cost $1/unit/period given low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Recent weeks show renewed higher demand (Periods 28-31 = 82,54,90,97) but with volatility; no new sustained regime shift (carry-over insights already record prior downshifts). Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to adapt to the most recent demand level while limiting noise from older regimes. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand spikes while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

All observed lead times historically =0. To capture the recent uptick and short-term volatility, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the last 3 periods (recent_N N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost exposure.

Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period. I keep L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent variability while avoiding over-weighting the single-week spike; this balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by keeping orders targeted to the latest observed demand pattern.

Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 90,97,82,169,98) has elevated variability with a single large spike at Period 33; to capture current demand level while smoothing older regime shifts, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (uses last 5 samples) and set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the review+lead demand forecast responsive to the recent demand pattern (including the spike) while relying on observed zero lead time so the OR backend can balance service level versus holding cost.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all periods (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 32-36 = 82,169,98,108,114) shows a higher short-run average (~114) versus earlier low-regime periods; to adapt to this recent regime and capture the current elevated demand and volatility, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded messages show consistent 0 lead time. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock reflecting recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed concluded history.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming stock visible; recent weeks show a clear demand spike. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 33-37) = [169,98,108,114,155], mean=128.8 \u2014 materially above prior recent average (~81.0). To cover the upcoming review+lead period while avoiding stockouts given the spike, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 5 periods so the OR backend targets the elevated demand; use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (avoiding lost sales during the spike) versus holding cost by restricting the window to the most recent 5 observations (limits overreaction to a single outlier).

Carry-over insight: Demand upshift starting Period 33: Periods 33-37 avg=128.8 vs prior 5-period avg\u224881.0 (+47.9%), sustained 5 periods

All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 historically. To balance service vs holding cost given low on-hand and confirmed 0 lead time, use promised lead time and let the OR engine compute demand mean/variance from full history (default).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times = 0 every concluded period so promised lead time=0 remains valid. Recent demand shows an upshift beginning at Period 33 (sustained ~5 periods through Period 37 and high demand continuing in 38-39), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to target the recent upshift regime and avoid dilution by older low-demand periods. Choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to better cover elevated demand while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) keeps orders aggressive enough to preserve service level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; recent demand shows an upshift beginning Period 33 sustained through Period 40 (periods 33-40 avg demand \u2248126.6 over 8 periods). To respect that regime shift and reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost modest, use promised lead time (default) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 8-period window (captures the sustained higher mean and recent volatility). This balances service (higher forecast) vs holding cost by updating demand estimates only where evidence is sustained and recent. No overdue shipments detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2323.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained demand upshift starting Period 33 (Periods 33-41 higher avg vs prior). Current on-hand=52, in-transit=0 so pipeline short for multi-period coverage. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in concluded messages, so keep L=default. To capture the post-changepoint regime, set demand estimate using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 33-41, length=9) so mu_hat reflects elevated mean; use same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts in higher-demand regime) while holding cost remains low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so selecting a recent-window raises target base stock appropriately.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Recent history includes a one-period extreme demand spike (Period 42 demand=355) but it is not a sustained regime change. Given no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift and no new sustained demand regime (needs \u22653 periods), use defaults so the OR backend applies full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (captures historical demand patterns) while avoiding overreaction to the single extreme spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 39-43 demands = 90,120,125,355,165) likely reflecting late-season lift; I therefore set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current upshift and high mean (~171) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. Volatility is elevated due to the large spike (Period 42=355), so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect higher observed std. These choices bias orders toward higher service during seasonality while letting the OR backend cap exposure via its cap.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16). On-hand=106, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained 3-period December spike (Periods 42-44) so bias forecast toward recent weeks while keeping promised lead time (historically LT=0). Set L=default to use promised 0. Set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the strong recent uplift (Periods 40-44). Keep sigma_hat=default to use overall volatility scaled by (1+L). This increases target base stock to meet holiday demand while avoiding overstating variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): holiday season with recent strong spike in demand (Periods 42-44 very high, Period 45 still elevated). On-hand=162, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand now but upcoming demand may remain elevated through Christmas. Historical lead times observed = 0 consistently, so keep L = default (promised). To capture the recent seasonal uptick while smoothing noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples to reflect current regime). This biases the base-stock toward higher level for the holiday weeks while letting the OR backend cap by its policy to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent history shows a confirmed seasonal peak in Dec (Periods 42-44) but demand has been volatile since; on-hand=247, in-transit=0 so we are well-stocked. All observed lead times = 0 historically. To avoid over-ordering into high on-hand inventory, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend's conservative base-stock will not amplify the seasonal spike.
