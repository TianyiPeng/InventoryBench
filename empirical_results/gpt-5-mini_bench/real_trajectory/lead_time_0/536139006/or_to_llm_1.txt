OR recommends 193 using longer-run history; that underestimates the recent surge. Cost tradeoff: profit=$19 >> holding=$1, so excess units are cheaper to carry than lost sales. Strategy: raise the order above OR to cover expected elevated demand this period while accepting modest holding cost risk. I order 300 units \u2014 between the recent 3-period average (~253) and the recent maximum (355), providing buffer for remaining holiday demand while limiting overstock if demand reverts.

Inventory: on-hand=168, in-transit=0. Recent demand pattern: Periods 41\u201345 demand = [125,355,165,240,132] with sold constrained by starting inventory in some weeks; Period 45 demand was 132 and fully met, Periods 42\u201344 showed a transient seasonal spike around early December. OR recommends 25 based on long-run history and promised lead time. Decision logic: given confirmed L=0, no in-transit stock, and current on-hand (168) exceeds a realistic next-period demand forecast (~130, using recent non-spike weeks and last week =132), we avoid ordering to prevent unnecessary holding cost and overstock after the recent seasonal peak. Profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), but current stock already sufficient to capture near-term sales; ordering additional units risks excess ending inventory once the seasonal spike passes.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period as order). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to meet Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 53, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has elevated sharply since Period 33 with large seasonal peaks in Periods 42\u201344 and sustained high weekly demand through Periods 41\u201346 (example demands: P41=125, P42=355, P43=165, P44=240, P45=132, P46=115) \u2014 overall recent demand regime is materially higher than the long-run historical sample. Cost tradeoffs: profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 so critical fractile q\u22480.95 (high service level justified). OR recommended 139 units using its capped base-stock; OR uses promised lead time (which matches observed 0) but doesn't account for recent sustained surge beyond older historical samples. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 139 units. Rationale: with lead time = 0 the OR order arrives in-period and helps meet elevated recent demand immediately; OR's cap smooths order swings and its high critical fractile matches our profit/holding economics. Given current on-hand (53) plus OR order (139) would provide ample coverage for an expected high-demand week while avoiding excessive overstock relative to the recent surge. I therefore place order = 139 for SKU 536139006.",
