Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~52.8 units/week with no observed concluded arrivals (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). No evidence of changed lead time or sustained demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised 0) so backend treats review+lead=(1+L)=1 period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands: Period1=64, Period2=62; historical sample mean ~52.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for upcoming demand. Both concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use calculate to set L (avg observed lead time=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast while keeping safety stock calculation consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived in the same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because 3 consecutive concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. Demand history (five weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb) is stable; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while reflecting observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1,P2,P3 orders arrived same period)

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand: observed demands (Periods1-4)=64,62,38,51 and on-hand=3, in-transit=0. All concluded lead times = 0, so use observed lead time. With profit=holding ($1 each) we keep default forecasting anchored to full-sample stats to avoid overfitting to short recent dip. Using calculate for L (confirming observed avg lead time=0) and default mu_hat/sigma_hat ensures the OR backend computes base-stock from long-run mean/variance while recognizing same-period replenishment; this balances service level vs holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-5) shows elevated weekly demand vs earlier sample but no clear sustained regime shift; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (orders arrive same period), so use promised/default L to keep backend assumptions. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand observations: 64,62,38,51,68) to reflect the most recent demand level and variability so the base-stock and cap better match current selling pace and avoid understocking this period. This balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost by keeping lead time short and volatility explicitly from recent data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20136); no missing shipments. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20136 concluded demands = 64,62,38,51,68,55) shows moderate variability and a mean around 56. To keep the OR backend responsive to the most recent regime, I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and std; keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). This supplies the backend with a (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility based on the latest observed demand profile, balancing service level (avoid stockouts with recent mean) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand history (Periods 1-7) shows variable weekly demand with a high spike at Period 7 (94) but no sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and all recent concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P7 arrived same period). No overdue or lost shipments. I therefore set L by calculate to let the backend confirm observed lead time from concluded history, and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all samples so the OR engine smooths the recent spike while balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so I keep L as default (promised 0). Recent demand shows a higher mean driven by a spike (Period 7=94); to adapt to the recent regime while remaining conservative I forecast demand using the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 4-8: 51,68,55,94,52). Therefore I set mu_hat with recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This balances service (covers recent higher demand) against holding cost given small on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) across many periods. Demand history is variable without a sustained regime change; therefore use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time=0. This keeps ordering responsive (same-period replenishment) while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

No sustained demand regime shift detected; shipments have consistently arrived same-period. Use default lead time and demand stats so the OR engine uses full historical mean/std (1+L multiplier) to set base-stock while avoiding manual overreaction to recent variance. This keeps service vs. holding balance given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in Period 4). Recent demand has softened vs. earlier history: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [52,37,24,18,47], mean \u224835.6. To keep orders responsive and limit holding cost (profit=holding), I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture recent volatility. L set to default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed same-period arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts with small base stock) against high holding cost by leaning on recent lower mean.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). SKU 658030006 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 across many periods) and no sustained demand regime shift; recent demand has varied but shows no structural change. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses lead time=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, giving a balanced base-stock level consistent with observed variability and the equal profit/holding cost tradeoff. No evidence of lost shipments or new regime to record.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has varied week-to-week but no sustained regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time so backend leverages full demand history for forecasting; default mu_hat and sigma_hat produce (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time observed = 0 in multiple concluded periods). No evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Profit and holding cost equal ($1/unit), so balance service vs. holding by using the backend's defaults which use all historical samples and promised lead time. I therefore choose default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std, letting its capped policy limit ordering.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-16) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and weekly demand varying ~18\u201394 with recent weeks 47,41,43,40,43; current on-hand=7, in-transit=0 so limited cover for this period. I retain promised lead time (default) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm L=0. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), leveraging all historical demand data to produce a stable base-stock while the confirmed zero lead time keeps pipeline short. This balances service level (meet volatile weekly demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201317). No overdue shipments. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses full historical sample set to compute base-stock covering (1+L) periods; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and current inventory position.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and on-hand=26, in-transit=0. Demand history has no sustained regime change; recent weeks show moderate variability but no >3-period shift. I choose default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1) and current positive on-hand inventory. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weeks show moderate demand volatility with several low-demand weeks (18\u201326) and occasional spikes (50\u201370). On-hand=30, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historically confirmed as 0 (Period 1\u201319 concludes all arrivals same period). No evidence of lost shipments or sustained regime change. Use default lead time so backend trusts promised LT=0 and use default demand estimators (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) to produce base-stock and cap consistent with historical variability while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent weekly demand has fallen versus earlier periods (most recent 5 demands: 43, 18, 23, 18, 9 \u2192 avg ~22). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ~1\u20132 weeks. Lead time has been confirmed 0 in prior history, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the clear recent downward demand regime (summer lull) I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean and volatility; this reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service. No evidence of new lost shipments or lead-time changes.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been low/moderate (last five concluded demands: 12,9,18,23,18) and historical lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (arrivals were same-period in past concludes). With profit=holding cost, service quantile is moderate; given confirmed L=0 and no outstanding shipments, use default estimators so the OR backend uses full-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time. This keeps pipeline small (no extra cover for in-transit) and balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and stable weekly demand without a clear, sustained shift. No overdue shipments observed. To let the OR engine use its full-sample demand estimates and the promised lead time, I select default methods for all parameters so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L = promised lead time. This balances service level and holding cost by relying on long-run demand statistics rather than short noisy windows.

Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent weekly demand has materially dropped versus earlier weeks: last 5 demands = [12,18,12,10,4], mean=11.2 (low, volatile). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so current cover is ~3+ weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 historically; keep promised lead time. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I base forecast on the most recent regime (last 5 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1-26), so use promised lead time. Demand has shifted down since early July (Periods 21-26 demands = 12,18,12,10,4,22; recent average ~13), a sustained lower regime of \u22486 weeks. To reflect the recent lower demand and avoid excess holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 weeks (recent_N=6). This keeps safety stock tight (profit=holding \u2192 service quantile 0.5) while protecting against short-term variability observed in the last 6 periods.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent stockout after Period 27 demand spike (48) but historical arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0). I use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xb7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xb7std, providing a smoothed forecast that balances service level against holding cost given no sustained regime change.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed in history). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 10,4,22,48,70) shows a sharp uptick beginning ~P27; to adapt quickly while reflecting recent volatility I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples. L uses the promised/default (0) consistent with observed lead time. This raises the target base-stock to serve the recent surge while sigma_hat based on recent data increases safety stock to avoid lost sales despite equal profit/holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 across multiple periods), so use promised/default lead time. No strong recent demand regime change detected across the full sample; use full-sample defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (periods 28-30 demands: 70,55,84 with stockouts). Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time; no lost shipments observed. To let the OR engine compute an unbiased replenishment target using full-sample statistics and the promised lead time, use default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap are derived from all available demand history. This balances service level (captures recent high demand via full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 28-31: 70,55,84,126) indicating a recent upward regime versus earlier summer weeks. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new higher-demand regime: I choose N=6 to cover the most recent six weeks (Periods 27-32 window) to be responsive but not overly reactive to one-week spikes. Use the same N for sigma_hat so variability reflects recent volatility. This raises the backend base-stock to improve service vs. lost sales while recognizing holding cost equals profit (q=0.5) so target is balanced.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has jumped (Period 30-32 demands: 84, 126, 115) vs earlier summer weeks mostly <=55, indicating a sustained upswing starting around late Aug/early Sep. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (Period 4 evidence) and promised lead time is 0, so keep L default. To capture the recent regime shift I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to weight the last ~6 weeks (captures the Sep spike) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect elevated recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward higher target stock to recover service level while keeping variability estimates aligned with recent data.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Recent demand has spiked sharply in weeks ending 2019-09-09..2019-09-23 (demands 126,115,227). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must order to cover immediate demand. Observed lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Period 4 insight); use promised lead time (default). Capture the new high-demand regime by using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base stock to service the much higher recent demand while reflecting elevated volatility. This balances service (avoid large lost sales in current spike) against holding cost by limiting the recency window to three periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg demand increased from 39.33 (Periods 1-30) to 156.0 (Periods 31-33), +297%

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-7). Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 31 (sharp increase: recent weekly demands 126,115,227,135). Current on-hand=21, in-transit=0 \u2014 low versus the new higher demand level, so we must forecast from the new regime. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 31-34) to capture the new higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the new high-demand regime while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the confirmed recent samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 31 (periods 31-35 average demand is much higher than periods 1-30). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covering the five most recent high-demand weeks) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher target base stock for service while keeping variability estimates grounded in the recent regime to avoid excessive holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime since Period 31 (higher weekly demand ~126\u2013227). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock is well below the new regime mean. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since arrivals historically conclude same period. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201336) so the OR backend targets a base-stock aligned with the elevated mean and observed volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-38), and a sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period 31 (higher demand from P31 onward). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 31-38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant regime. This ensures base-stock reflects the new higher mean and volatility while relying on confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained, higher regime starting Period 31 (periods 31-39 elevated). Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically, so use default L. To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=9, periods 31-39) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the elevated samples; this balances service (avoid stockouts in the new regime) while limiting excess holding by using only recent data rather than all-history dilution.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P40). Demand jumped at Period 31 and has stayed higher since (Periods 31\u201340 are the new high-demand regime). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 31\u201340) so mu_hat reflects the new sustained higher regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher base stock aligned with the sustained demand increase while keeping lead-time assumptions faithful to observed arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0. A sustained demand regime shift occurred starting Period 31 (much higher weekly demand since then). To capture the post-shift demand level I use a recent-window forecast: set L to promised (default 0) and compute mu_hat using the last 11 post-shift samples (Periods 31\u201341) so the OR engine targets current higher demand. I also set sigma_hat using the same recent 11-sample window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (reduce stockouts under the new high-demand regime) against holding cost by focusing estimates on the confirmed higher-demand regime rather than diluted long-run averages.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 31 (avg ~156 for P31-33 and elevated demands through P42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need forecast that reflects the new higher regime. Use L=default since lead time has been confirmed as 0 previously. Set mu_hat via recent_N using the most recent regime (Periods 31\u201342, regime_length=12 \u2192 N=12) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new higher demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand regime (from Period 31) is much higher (+~297%) and sustained through Periods 31-43; on-hand=103, in-transit=0 so we currently hold substantial stock vs high recent demand. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). To capture the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (periods 31\u201343) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime, improving service during this sustained higher-demand period while the OR backend balances holding cost via its capped policy.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 31 (Periods 31-44 consistently much higher than Periods 1-30). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically. To reflect the new, higher-demand regime I target demand estimates using the recent post-changepoint samples (Periods 31-44, regime length=14). I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant high-demand regime, balancing service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost (use recent variance). This ensures orders cover current period demand while avoiding oversized replenishment driven by older low-demand history.

To reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data, I use promised lead time (default) and compute demand stats from the recent post-changepoint regime (Periods 31\u201346, N=16). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat toward the current higher mean and observed volatility, letting the OR backend set base stock for higher service with cap limiting extreme orders given holding cost=profit.
