{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history (Periods 1..46) confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals occur same period). Inventory: on-hand=3, in-transit=0 so available before demand this period = 3. Demand outlook: recent sustained high demand since Periods 30+, most recent weeks (P43\u2013P46) = 122,130,126,122, mean \u2248125 units/week; this elevated regime (avg \u2248108\u2013125 in P26\u2013P46) is sustained. Economics: profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=4/5=0.8 (z\u22480.84) so we want safety but primary driver is very high one-period demand. OR recommends 104 (understates recent peak weeks). With lead time 0 we only need to cover one future period (L+1=1). Target on-hand after arrival \u2248 recent one-period demand + modest safety \u2248125 (matching recent mean and safety). Order = target \u2212 on-hand = 125 \u2212 3 = 122. This fills to expected single-period demand while minimizing extra holding cost given strong recent sales and 0 lead time. Follow-up: monitor next periods for any demand reversal; no new carry-over insight recorded.",
