Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248173.4 units/week and std \u224818.2. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected; no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. I use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set. This balances service (use historical mean) against holding cost given no evidence of regime change or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~173.4 units/week. Period 1 concluded an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 and heavy realized demand (227) consumed the 191-unit arrival leaving on-hand=0 and no in-transit. Pipeline is empty going into Period 2 so we must cover current period demand after decision. I set L by computing observed lead times (single observed lead_time=0) so the backend will treat lead time as 0. For demand forecast I use the default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to be anchored to historical weekly mean; volatility also uses default to reflect historical variability. These conservative defaults balance service (cover typical weekly demand) while avoiding excess holding given positive holding cost and the recent high outlier demand in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two confirmed arrivals with observed lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; demand in concluded periods exceeded arrivals (sold 191,207 vs demand 227,284) but this is only a two-period uptick \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Use promised/observed lead time 0 (default). Use default demand estimation (1+L times mean of all historical samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend apply its standard base-stock calculation without overreacting to a short two-period spike while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $754.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand shows a sustained upward shift: Period1-3 demands = [227, 284, 198] (avg 236) vs earlier historical samples (161,145,179,196,186 \u2192 avg 173). All observed lead times in concluded history = 0. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead time average (0). To capture the recent higher-demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 (the three most recent periods) so the OR backend targets service for the new demand level while keeping volatility based on the recent regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by avoiding dilution with older, lower-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: avg demand increased from 173 (older samples) to 236 over Periods 1-3 (+36%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent realized weekly demand has been elevated (P1-4 demands = 227,284,198,214) versus older historical mean (~173). On-hand=60, in-transit=0; concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders in P1-P4 arrived with 0 periods). To reflect the confirmed short lead time and recent higher demand, set L via calculate (avg observed lead times=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to base the (1+L) forecast on the last four realized demands, capturing the new regime while limiting noise. This balances service level (captures demand uptick) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the older lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $812.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P5 each arrived same period), so I set L by averaging observed lead times. Recent demand samples (P1\u2013P5: 227,284,198,214,215) show a sustained higher regime (carry-over noted previously); overall sample mean \u2248 227.6. To let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost using full-sample stats, I choose default demand/volatility inputs so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the policy responsive to the confirmed higher demand while relying on observed stable lead time (no evidence of lost shipments).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (Periods 1\u20136). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty and demand has been higher than older baseline (~201\u2013284 recent weekly demand). A sustained higher-demand regime was previously detected (Periods 1\u20133 onward). To balance service vs holding cost, keep lead time set to observed average (calculate=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime while limiting noise. Use the same recent window for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand (Periods 1-7) averages ~220 units/week with moderate variability; on-hand=68, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 historically, so I set L via calculation of observed lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and avoid understocking, I use recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility (captures all available post-shift samples). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current demand while the sigma estimate preserves safety stock; this balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by prioritizing service (reduce lost sales) but using recent volatility to limit excess inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has averaged ~216 units/week with volatility; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Observed historical conclude messages show actual lead time=0 consistently, so use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (periods with demands 214,215,215,186,249 \u2192 mean\u2248215.8) so mu_hat reflects current weekly demand without stale older samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and ensure the base-stock safety buffer aligns with recent variability. These choices favor service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to recent higher mean while keeping safety driven by recent std to limit excess holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (periods listed) shows no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this balances service vs holding costs given stable lead time and recent moderate variability. No overdue shipments to flag.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been lower than early samples; to reflect the most recent demand regime I use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility (last 5 periods) and keep promised lead time default=0. This keeps orders responsive to the latest observed demand while avoiding excess holding given $1/unit holding cost vs $4 profit.

Recent demand has varied but no new, sustained regime shift since prior insight. Use default promised lead time and demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level given zero pipeline while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no in-transit stock; on-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples available (weeks in Feb) and subsequent periods show stable variability with no new sustained regime shift since prior carry-over. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps orders aligned with observed delivery reliability and balances service level vs holding cost given current on-hand buffer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 periods (orders from P1\u2013P16 concluded with W=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demands fluctuate but long-run sample mean (historical series provided) remains stable; no new 3+ period sustained regime shift beyond the previously recorded insight. To balance $4 profit vs $1 holding, use default demand estimates so OR backend applies base-stock from full-sample mean and variance; this keeps service high while avoiding unnecessary additional holding given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent weekly demand has moderated vs. earlier high weeks; on-hand=80, in-transit=0, no overdue or lost shipments (all concluded lead_times=0). Historical concluded lead_times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time. To keep responsiveness to recent demand while limiting holding cost, I forecast using the last 5 weeks (captures recent lower demand since May). Therefore: L=default (0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to target current demand level. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability. No evidence of new lost shipments or lead-time shifts.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand has drifted lower versus early periods (last 5 demands: 143,168,118,139,122; recent mean ~138). On-hand=57, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so keep L=default (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and avoid overstock given holding cost; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances a high target service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> high q) while limiting excess inventory from earlier higher-demand periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand 82, in-transit 0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders arrived same period). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks but no new sustained regime shift detected. Use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and scaled std over all samples; this leverages full history while respecting observed zero lead time and lets the backend balance service level (profit/holding cost = 4/1) against inventory cost.

Recent demand has fallen versus earlier regime; last 5 observed demands (Periods 18-22) average ~114 units. I set L=default to trust the repeatedly observed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the recent lower-demand regime and avoids overstocking. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for the backend service-level calculation while limiting holding cost exposure.

This keeps targets responsive and balances service level (profit>holding) while limiting holding costs given current high on-hand inventory.

Recent demand has declined vs earlier months (last 5 demands: P21-25 = 116,120,120,63,94) so I downweight long-run mean and base forecast on the most recent regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals observed in concluded history. These choices keep target stock aligned with current demand to balance service (profit $4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover next period demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in P1\u2013P26 all concluded with lead_time 0). Recent demand (Periods 22\u201326 = 120,120,63,94,146) has mean 108.6 and noticeable variability; I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime rather than the full-sample mean. Set L=default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat recent_N N=5 uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean to target next-period demand. sigma_hat recent_N N=5 uses recent sample volatility to size safety stock given higher service level (profit/total cost implies high service target). This balances service (avoid lost sales with on-hand 0) against holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent Period 27 showed a one-off demand spike (301) but not a sustained regime change (only one period). No overdue arrivals observed; historical concluded lead times remain 0. To avoid overreacting to a single spike, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level against holding cost given limited evidence of a new demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp spike (Periods 26-28: 146,301,251) vs earlier baseline. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep L=default (promised lead time). To react to the new high-demand regime while limiting hold cost exposure, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current spike, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased volatility from these three most recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 27: avg demand over Periods 26-28 = 232.7 vs avg over Periods 20-26 = 104.6 (+123%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent strong demand spike (Periods 27-29: 301,251,231) is the dominant signal; to reflect the new higher regime while keeping response responsive, I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=3 (most recent three demand samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the spike. No overdue or lost shipments observed. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the new high-demand regime while sigma_hat based on the same 3 recent samples captures increased volatility and keeps orders from overshooting given holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Recent demand shows a sustained spike starting Period 27 (demands: P27=301, P28=251, P29=231, P30=357) \u2014 regime length 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus elevated regime. Set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping variance estimate recent. This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and volatility to reduce stockouts during the confirmed spike while cap still limits extreme over-ordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand spike started Period 27 (demands: P27-31 = 301,251,231,357,328; avg\u2248293 over 5 periods) \u2014 materially above earlier baseline. No overdue arrivals observed. I set L=default (promised lead time=0, historically observed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers P27\u2013P31). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the confirmed high-demand regime while letting the backend compute safety stock from observed recent mean and std, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201332: demands = 301, 251, 231, 357, 328, 341 \u2014 six periods elevated vs earlier history). To capture this recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (focus on the last six samples) so the OR backend raises base stock for the sustained spike while L stays at default. No currently missing shipments to adjust for.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Demand has a clear, sustained high-demand regime since Period 27 (demands: 301,251,231,357,328,341,612); I capture this by using recent_N=7 for demand mean and std to bias the base-stock toward the higher recent demand and to reflect increased volatility. This ensures pipeline targets cover the new elevated demand while sigma from recent data inflates safety stock to preserve service without excessive long-term holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Demand shows a sustained high regime starting Period 27 (Periods 27-34 all elevated vs earlier history); I therefore bias forecast to recent demand. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent high-demand regime (Periods 27-34). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 27 (sustained high weekly sales through Period 35, incl. a 612 spike in P33 and multiple 300+ orders). On-hand=158, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty so available cover is only on-hand. Promised lead time historically observed = 0. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent samples from the post-changepoint window (Periods 27\u201335, 9 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility. L kept as default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded lead times=0. Using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat increases the base-stock to cover the higher immediate demand; recent_N for sigma_hat increases safety stock for the observed higher variability. This balances service (avoid lost sales during the sustained spike) against holding cost given current positive on-hand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0) and there are no overdue/missing shipments, so use promised lead time. Recent weeks (Periods 32\u201336) show elevated and volatile demand vs earlier in-year; to adapt quickly I set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). This balances higher service level for recent demand spikes against holding cost given already healthy on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows sustained high regime since Period 27 (large spike through Periods 27-37); to capture current elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N=6 (most recent 6 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while limiting carry. This balances higher service during the sustained spike against holding cost given on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): on-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 \u2192 confirmed actual lead time = 0. Recent sustained high-demand regime begins at Period 27 (covered in prior carry-over insight); use recent data from this regime to forecast. Set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (regime length Periods 27\u201338 = 12) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most relevant recent samples. This raises service-level targeting to cover elevated demand while keeping safety stock tied to observed recent volatility, balancing profit-driven fill rates vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (large spike sustained through Periods 27-39). On-hand=185, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To capture the sustained elevated demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility, using the recent high-demand regime length (~13 periods from P27\u2013P39) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the most relevant samples and reduces stockouts versus using the old low-demand baseline. L remains default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm lead_time=0. This balances service level (higher mu_hat from recent regime) against holding cost by using recent samples rather than overreacting to single peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently\u2014use promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated since late Aug (sustained spike through Oct-Nov); to capture the current higher regime I use recent window to compute demand across review+lead. Choose recent_N with N=12 (captures roughly the last 12 weeks of elevated demand) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a higher base-stock while measuring recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost given current sizable on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=169, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand has been elevated since late Aug/Sept (carry-over insights already recorded). To keep policy simple and let the OR engine use full-sample statistics, I use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids overfitting short-term noise while the on-hand balance (169) provides buffer against demand variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (no evidence of delays or lost shipments), so keep promised lead time. Recent weeks show volatile/high demand (including an extreme censored demand spike in Period 42 where on-hand constrained sales), but there is not yet a sustained new regime (>=3 concluded periods) beyond earlier recorded shifts. To let the OR backend use full-sample statistics while avoiding overfitting to the single extreme censored spike, I choose default methods so the engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent history shows high variability including a single large surge at Period 42 (733) but no new sustained regime change of 3+ periods since prior recorded insights. Promised lead time remains appropriate.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=23, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 27 (summer spike continuing through autumn) so I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent elevated mean and volatility; choose N=18 to cover the recent regime (Periods 27\u201344) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to serve the (1+L) review+lead horizon while reflecting current demand and risk. This increases service level to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while accepting higher holding cost given profit>holding.

Recent demand (Periods 43-45 = 169, 304, 258) shows elevated demand vs long-run; I use recent_N to capture this short-term regime: set L=default to keep lead time=0, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility.
