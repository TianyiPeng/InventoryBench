Step 2 \u2014 Demand evidence: historical weekly mean from samples = 173.4, std \u224820.4. OR computed base-stock 190.6 and capped to 207 (matches OR's recommendation). However Period 1 realized demand was 227 with a stockout (sold 191, unmet demand 36), indicating recent demand > historical mean. Step 3 \u2014 Decision tradeoff: with lead time = 0 we can react immediately; a one-period high demand spike is not yet a sustained regime shift (only one observation), so I avoid a large permanent increase. To avoid repeating the recent stockout while not overstocking, I order enough to cover the realized demand from Period 1 (227 units). This slightly increases OR's 207 to match observed demand and uses same-period arrival to satisfy Period 2.

Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=52, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has been elevated through autumn and into December (Periods 39\u201344 sold: 231,278,245,297,169,304 with a massive constrained demand event P42=733), and calendar date 2019/12/16 implies holiday-season demand risk of sustained high sales. OR baseline recommends ordering 276 units using promised L=0 and historical demand; its cap mitigates extreme swings. Given confirmed L=0 (so no pipeline delay) and elevated recent demand plus positive profit margin (profit $4 > holding $1), I follow the OR recommendation to replenish aggressively to avoid stockouts during peak season. Final action: order 276 units (arrives same period), which with on-hand 52 provides 328 units available for immediate demand. This balances lost-sales cost vs holding cost in a high-demand period.",
