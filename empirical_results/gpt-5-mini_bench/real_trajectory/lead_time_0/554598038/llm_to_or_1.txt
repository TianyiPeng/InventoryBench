Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows an upward shift (last three weekly samples: 11, 17, 38). No on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default L=0). To capture the recent upward regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (weights last 3 weeks). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage for the emerging demand while keeping lead time at the promised value due to no observed arrivals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period1 conclude shows order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=22, lead_time=0) confirming at least one 0-period arrival. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand ~13.2 with higher recent observed demand (censored at 54 in Period1), but that Period1 demand was stock-limited so not reliable as a full-regime shift. Promised lead time is 0 and the single confirmed arrival supports keeping the default promised lead time. To avoid overreacting to a censored spike, use default demand estimates: mu_hat default (1+L \xd7 mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std of all samples). This balances service vs holding cost conservatively given limited confirmed evidence of a sustained demand increase or lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 in both concludes). Demand has jumped recently: historical series (0,0,11,17,38) plus Period1 demand=54 and Period2 demand=100. I treat lead time as confirmed 0 and use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the upward regime. Chosen methods: L by calculate to confirm observed lead time=0; mu_hat recent_N with N=3 using the last 3 demand samples (38,54,100) to reflect the new higher mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to meet current higher demand while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: recent avg (Periods with demands 38,54,100) = 64 vs prior overall avg 13.2 (+~384%); treat as sustained until contradictory evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime (recent demands: 54, 100, 113) vs prior low demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for higher regime. Observed concluded lead times for prior arrivals are 0 periods (Periods 1-3), so use calculated average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (N=3 = last three demand observations). This raises the base-stock to protect service without excessive holding given Profit=Holding.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime (recent demands: 54,100,113,88; recent mean \u224888.75) versus earlier low values. On-hand=1, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded history shows arrivals same-period (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm 0. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (N chosen = 4 recent periods in the regime). These parameters steer the OR backend to a base-stock that covers the current elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows sustained higher demand since Period 3 (Period3-5 demands = 113,88,56). On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments observed. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead times are 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To capture the higher recent regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 3-period regime (N=3). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead_times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period), so set L by calculate to reflect observed average lead time=0. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 3 (demands P3\u2013P6 = 113,88,56,71; recent mean=82) so use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to match the higher post-change demand while keeping L factual, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has increased and stabilized since Period 3 (higher mean from Period 3 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Use observed lead times (all concluded = 0) so set L via calculate (avg observed = 0). For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u20137) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. For volatility, use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock vs holding tradeoff.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently (orders arrived same period), so use default promised L. Demand shifted up at Period 3 and has held: recent demands (Periods 3-8) = [113,88,56,71,114,107], regime length = 6. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher mean and current volatility. This ensures the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk aligned to observed variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent weeks show sustained high demand since Period 3 (runs of weekly demands: 54,100,113,88,56,71,114,107,122) \u2014 a clear regime shift vs earlier low weeks. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I set L to default (promised=0) since observed lead times confirm same-period arrival. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (regime from Period 3\u2192Period 9 length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-changepoint mean/volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1). This raises target base stock to meet the higher sustained demand while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Periods 1\u20139 orders all arrived same period, e.g., P1 ordered arrived P1, ... P9 ordered arrived P9)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 3 and has persisted (high weekly sales 54\u2192133). All recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). I therefore use promised lead time (default) to let OR assume same-period arrivals, and set demand forecast using the recent regime (most recent 8 periods from the changepoint at Period 3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand and recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding (service quantile q=0.5). No evidence of lost shipments to adjust L or safety stock further.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (much higher weekly demand since P3). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes (P1\u2013P11) confirm actual lead time = 0, so keep L as default. For demand forecasting, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u201311, 9 samples) to capture the higher sustained mean and volatility; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service (higher mean) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows sustained higher demand starting Period 3 (weeks with demands 38,54,100 then continued high weekly demand through Period 12). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u201312 confirm actual lead time = 0. To capture the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime (Periods 3\u201312, length=10) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the recent high-demand samples. Use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts in sustained higher-demand regime) while letting the backend apply the capped order cap to limit excess holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history (Periods 3\u201313) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs pre-Period 3 (avg jumped ~+384%). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages. I set L based on observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand and volatility using the full recent regime (Periods 3\u201313, 11 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand rather than long-run low past. This balances service (capture higher mean) against holding cost by using recent-data estimates.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0 (orders in P1\u2013P14 arrived same period). Demand regime shift detected at Period 3 (sustained higher demand since P3). Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (periods P3\u2013P14) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean/volatility and avoid dilution from pre-shift zeros. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the sustained higher-demand regime.

Historical concludes show confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3 with much higher weekly demand through Period 15. I keep L as default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (Period 3\u201315 regime length) so the OR engine bases forecasts and variability on the new, higher-demand regime; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P16) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 3 (weeks with large demands since P3). Use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201316, length 14) so the OR engine targets current elevated demand. Choices: L default (promised 0); mu_hat recent_N N=14 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=14 to capture volatility of the same regime. This ensures orders reflect the sustained higher demand while keeping holding risk aligned to recent variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime (since Period 3) is much higher and sustained (~mean \u2248 120 over last 15 weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Set L using promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows lead time = 0 consistently. Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (15 recent samples since changepoint at Period 3). This gives the OR engine a forecast and volatility that reflect the new higher-demand regime, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P18) show actual lead time = 0 consistently and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 3 (higher demand since P3). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (will be ~0). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 3\u201318) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service for the higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples; with lead time confirmed 0 there is no pipeline to cover beyond the current period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 3 (weekly demands high since then). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Set L to default (promised 0) reflecting confirmed observations. Use recent_N (N=17, Periods 3\u201319) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime rather than older low-demand samples; N=17 equals the regime length (capped rules).

For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained high-demand regime: use last 18 post-changepoint samples (Periods 3\u201320) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility, improving service while controlling holding given profit=holding.

To capture the post-changepoint regime, set lead time to calculated (confirming observed 0) and use recent_N over the regime since Period 3 to estimate demand mean/volatility. Regime length = Periods 3\u201321 (19 samples) \u2192 N=19. This balances service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost by basing forecasts on the sustained higher-demand regime while respecting confirmed zero lead time so orders arrive same period.

Date 2019-07-15. Demand has remained in the higher regime since Period 3 (sustained weekly demand ~100\u2013150 in recent weeks). On-hand=35, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to use promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (last 10 weeks mean \u2248121 units) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep safety stock aligned to the sustained elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time=0) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3. I set L via calculate to let the backend confirm the historically observed lead time (avg observed = 0). To capture the sustained elevated demand pattern, I use recent_N N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility emphasize the recent high-demand regime while still smoothing variability across recent weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high weekly demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand statistics.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained higher weekly sales vs earlier samples). On-hand=11, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed (historical concludes show lead_time=0 consistently). I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (all concluded lead_time=0). To capture the sustained higher demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (capped at 20) so the OR backend bases base-stock on the most recent high-demand regime and corresponding volatility. This balances service (meet higher demand) against holding costs by sizing forecast and uncertainty from the recent regime rather than diluted older low-demand data.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). History shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 3 (many weeks of 80\u2013160 weekly demand vs. two near-zero early samples). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages. To focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime, I use recent_N for demand with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 weeks, bounded by the guideline). sigma_hat also uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms 0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201326) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3. To reflect recent sustained higher demand while using the backend's lead-time assumption, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (N=20) so (1+L)\xd7mean uses recent samples rather than long-ago low-demand weeks. Keep sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) against holding cost given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3. I keep L = promised (0) to match observed arrivals and avoid inflating pipeline. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand periods (captures the sustained elevated demand while smoothing older low samples). With profit=holding, the backend targets q=0.5; using recent statistics helps balance service level vs holding cost given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 3 (sustained higher weekly sales); on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Lead time history (concluded messages) consistently shows same-period arrivals; I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent 20 weeks of demand rather than older low-demand samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in the higher regime) against holding cost by using recent demand stats and an accurate short lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time reliably 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P29). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 3 (carry-over insight): recent demand levels are materially higher than the pre-Period-3 baseline. To capture the sustained higher demand, set lead time to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts and volatility reflect the post-changepoint regime (using the most recent 20 demand samples). This balances higher service-level needs from elevated demand while avoiding over-reacting to older low-demand samples; with profit=holding, the backend will set z accordingly.

With promised lead time 0 and confirmed behavior, use default lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for demand mean/volatility to capture the sustained higher regime (most recent 20 samples reflect current seasonality and reduced variance vs very early low-demand samples). This keeps (1+L)=1 so mu_hat reflects one-period demand forecast and sigma_hat captures recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To be responsive to the recent decline while respecting the long-run regime signal, I set L to default (promised=0) and base demand estimates on the last 3 periods (recent_N N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps the OR engine focused on the near-term demand level (reducing overstock risk) while leveraging the backend's service-level math.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201333). Recent demand has fallen from the prior high regime (~110\u2013120) to a lower sustained level over Periods 26\u201333. No overdue shipments detected. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed deliveries. For demand forecast, use recent_N on the most recent detected lower-demand regime (Periods 26\u201333) to capture the sustained drop; set sigma_hat recent_N on the same window to reflect reduced variability. These parameters reduce excess stocking from the old high-demand regime while preserving service given short lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg demand P26\u2013P33 = 56.9 (8 periods) vs prior avg ~115 (+/-), sustained lower regime confirmed

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand settled into the lower regime that started Period 26 (P26\u2013P33 avg \u224856.9); latest week P34=24 but not enough to overturn the established lower regime. On-hand=33, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrivals. Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the confirmed lower-demand regime (uses P26\u2013P33). This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service for the lower demand level given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 26\u201335) shows a sustained lower-demand regime after the earlier high regime (carry-over note: regime shift starting Period 26, avg \u224856.9). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). To reflect the recent lower regime, I set demand estimates using recent_N with N=10 (covers Periods 26\u201335, regime_length=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to the current demand level and variance. No overdue shipments detected; policy will avoid overstock by using recent demand statistics.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (P26\u2013P36 avg \u2248 56.9 then falling to ~33 over last 7 weeks). On-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments (historical lead time consistently 0). Because actual lead time is stable at 0 and recent demand regime is lower/smoothing, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower-demand regime (Periods 26\u201336 inclusive) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime, reducing excess inventory while preserving service given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P37). Recent demand has fallen from earlier high regimes; last 8 weekly demands (P30\u2013P37) = [53,37,29,45,24,16,17,27], recent avg ~31/week. No evidence of new sustained changepoint beyond the known lower-demand regime. To minimize holding cost with low demand and zero observed lead time, keep promised lead time (default=0), forecast demand using recent data (capture current lower mean) and estimate volatility from the same recent window so OR backend sets a smaller base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 34 (recent demands P34\u2013P38 = 24,16,17,27,12; recent average \u224819). To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost, I reduce forecast to reflect the new low regime by using recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. Use default lead time (promised 0) which matches observed concludes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders P1\u2013P39 arrived same period). Recent demand has dropped into a lower regime: Periods 32\u201339 demands = [29,45,24,16,17,27,12,12], recent avg \u224822.75. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These settings align the backend base-stock toward lower demand and avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 26 (avg \u224856.9) and recent weeks (P34\u2013P40) show low weekly demand (24,16,17,27,12,12,8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the current lower regime: choose N=15 (regime length P26\u2013P40 \u224815 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent lower mean/volatility and avoid overstock while maintaining service given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the lower regime confirmed earlier (Periods 26\u201333 note and sustained low demand since Period 34). Last 8 demands (P34\u2013P41): 24,16,17,27,12,12,8,15 -> recent avg \u224816.4/week. On-hand=24, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time default is 0 and historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to use promised 0. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 so the backend targets ~(1+L)*recent mean (~16.4). For variability I use recent_N sigma_hat with N=8 to measure volatility from the same recent window. This reduces excess holding while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Current on-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing arrivals visible in concludes. Historical concludes show confirmed lead_time=0 in many periods. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (sustained lower weekly demand). Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to let backend confirm 0. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the identified lower-demand regime (Periods 26\u201343, regime_length=18) so mu_hat reflects current lower weekly demand multiplied by (1+L). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture recent variability. These choices reduce excess holding given profit=holding cost, while maintaining service for the lower current demand level.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a low recent regime since Period 34 (recent 11 weeks P34\u2013P44 avg ~15 units/week). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the current low-demand regime (so base_stock will reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility), balancing fill-rate needs against equal profit/holding cost (q=0.5) which favors median stocking. This approach responds to the sustained lower demand while relying on confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use observed lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility based on the last 7 periods (captures the most recent pattern while meeting the N rules). This keeps target base-stock small (reducing holding cost) but preserves service for the current low-demand level.
