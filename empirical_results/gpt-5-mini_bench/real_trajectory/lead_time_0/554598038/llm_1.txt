  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-02-11 \u2014 no major apparel holiday this week, but Valentine\u2019s Day (2019-02-14) is imminent and can modestly boost womens' T\u2010shirt demand. Product: everyday womens' jersey T\u2010shirt \u2014 relevant to steady/seasonal wear rather than one-off seasonal item. Historical demand: recent 5 weekly samples show a clear upward shift: 2019-01-07=0, 2019-01-14=0, 2019-01-21=11, 2019-01-28=17, 2019-02-04=38. Demand appears to have entered a higher regime over the last 3 periods (avg \u224822 units/week). Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time 0 but no concluded arrivals yet; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0, so any order placed now is the only available supply for upcoming demand (and will arrive during this period but only be visible next period). Cost tradeoff: profit $1/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is expensive (equal to profit), so avoid large overstock. Forecast & order logic: adopt conservative order near the recent 3-period mean to cover expected demand while limiting holding exposure, with slight awareness of a small Valentine\u2019s uplift. Therefore order 22 units.",
