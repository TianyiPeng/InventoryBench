Demand history (weekly): 0, 0, 11, 17, 38 \u2014 clear upward trajectory but only one very large recent observation (2019-02-04). OR's capped base-stock recommendation is 14 units (uses historical mean/variance and promised L=0). Risk tradeoffs: profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), so overstocking is costly; understocking loses the $1 profit per unit. Given the single recent spike, I won't assume a sustained regime shift (insufficient 3+ period evidence), but I will modestly increase stock above OR to protect against near-term demand surge. Action decision: order 18 units (slightly above OR's 14) to cover a higher near-term demand while limiting holding exposure.
