Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows an increasing trend (23,29,31,38,50). No on-hand or in-transit stock and promised lead time is 0. Use L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 (samples 2019-01-21,2019-01-28,2019-02-04) to capture the upward regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward vs. long-run mean to reduce stockouts given rising demand while keeping holding risk moderate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: avg increased from 34.2 to 39.67 (+16%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Last conclude shows Period1 order arrived (lead_time=0). No overdue shipments. Demand recent uptick (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) motivates using the most recent 3 samples for demand forecast. Choose L=default to trust observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent mean (~39.67); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to improve service while holding cost equals profit, so moderate safety stock via recent volatility is appropriate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded lead times (Periods 1-2) = 0 periods. Recent sales (Period1=36, Period2=60) exceed older historical mean and carry-over flagged a regime increase beginning 2019-01-21. Set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead times confirm 0. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to upweight recent high demand while still smoothing historical data, helping the OR backend raise the base stock for higher service without overreacting. Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full sample history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). Recent demand (concluded) = [36, 60, 37]; historical earlier samples show a prior upward shift captured in carry-over. I choose L=calculate to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded arrivals. Demand is volatile recently (60 spike), so use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the last three realized demands; (1+L) multiplier will be applied by backend. This keeps base stock responsive to the recent spike while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show all observed lead_times = 0 (Periods 1-4). Demand in the last 4 concluded periods = [36,60,37,51], which is more relevant than earlier Jan samples and indicates a higher recent mean. Set L by calculating average observed lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current elevated demand regime; this focuses the base-stock on the most recent behavior and keeps safety stock responsive given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent zero actual lead time (all arrivals annotated lead_time=0). Recent demand in Periods 1-5 = [36,60,37,51,44], clearly above earlier base samples; carry-over previously recorded a +16% upward shift around 2019-01-21\u21922019-02-04. On-hand=2, in-transit=0; with profit=holding, service-level tradeoff requires provisioning for the elevated recent demand. I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirming 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine targets base stock appropriate to the new higher regime and reflects recent variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). Recent demand (Periods 1-6 concluded) = [36,60,37,51,44,54]; there is higher and variable demand vs earlier sample set, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Choose L=default to reflect the promised/observed zero lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand mean and volatility over the latest 6 periods, which balances service (cover higher recent mean) against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated and variable (concluded demands over last 7 periods: 36,60,37,51,44,54,49) and on-hand + in-transit = 0 so we need coverage. All concluded lead-time observations = 0, so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the most recent regime and volatility (captures the post-2019-01-21 higher demand regime). This balances service (use recent mean across (1+L) periods) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the latest 7 samples rather than long-ago history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 all arrived with lead_time=0), so use observed lead time behavior. Recent demand has risen (last periods: 51,44,54,49,68) \u2014 I treat a recent higher-demand regime. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5-week regime (captures the upward shift), balancing service level against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base_stock from recent mean and volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows every order arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low versus recent weekly demand (mean ~48.7). To keep OR backend aligned with observed operations I set L using observed lead times (average=0). Demand forecast and volatility use all historical samples (no strong new sustained regime beyond the previously recorded shift), so use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (capture recent mean ~48.7) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22: recent weekly demand elevated and volatile (last 10 demands: 36,60,37,51,44,54,49,68,39,41). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline is effectively empty so we need higher target stock. All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so keep L=default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (periods 6\u201310 mean \u224850.2) which raises the base-stock to cover near-term demand while sigma from the same recent window captures current volatility and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-11) shows demand samples: [36,60,37,51,44,54,49,68,39,41,37] (mean\u224846.91). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals pending. All observed lead times have been 0 in concluded history, so I use the promised/default lead time. No sustained new demand regime detected beyond prior carry-over. I choose default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P12) show all arrivals had lead_time=0, so actual lead time confirmed as 0. No new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over insight. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals; use default demand/volatility (all samples) to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period). Demand has been elevated recently (last 6 demands: 68,39,41,37,50,50 \u2192 higher mean than early samples). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I set lead time to the observed average, and use a recent_N forecast (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime.

Recent demand has risen and is volatile (last 7 demands: 68,39,41,37,50,50,61); I use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current regime and the same recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

To cover current period plus lead, use recent_N demand estimate to capture higher recent mean and recent volatility for safety; keep L as default (promised 0). This balances service (avoid stockouts given spikes) vs holding cost by sizing to recent demand rather than long-ago low samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0. Demand has shifted up starting Period 14 (2019-05-13) with three+ high periods (61,76,79). I keep L as default (promised 0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. For demand I focus on the new high regime: use recent_N (last 3 periods: P14-16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility and to avoid understocking given current spike. This balances service (capturing recent higher demand) against holding cost by limiting to the small recent sample rather than the long-run mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg before P14 (P1-13)=47.38 -> avg P14-16=72.0 (+52%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent weeks (P14\u2013P17) show a sustained higher-demand regime (demands 61,76,79,78). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current period demand. Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L by averaging observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the detected changepoint (P14 onward) where regime_length=4, so N=4 to capture the new higher mean. Similarly use recent_N N=4 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while keeping variance estimate focused on the new regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has shifted higher since Period 14 (recent demands: P14-18 = 61,76,79,78,82; avg \u224875.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover (1+L) periods. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L to use observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the 5-period high-demand regime to capture the new mean; sigma_hat uses the same 5 most recent samples to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock up to service the sustained higher demand while keeping variability estimate recent so holding cost is not overstated.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 14 (higher summer demand). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; shipments historically conclude with lead_time=0. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (regime from P14\u2013P19 length=6) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent high-demand regime, which balances higher service need during the sustained summer uplift while avoiding overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P20 all arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 14 (P14\u2013P20 mean \u2248 72); I treat that as the current demand regime. Set L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 14\u201320) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the current high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the base-stock to the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time assumptions consistent with concluded evidence, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods, so keep L as promised (default). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (sustained elevated demand P14-P21); to capture the recent regime I use a recent_N forecast for demand with N=8 (P14-P21). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to the single large spike in Period 21.

All concluded lead times = 0 (no delayed or lost arrivals observed). I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (P14\u2013P22, 9 periods) so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to the sustained higher demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance; no explicit adjustment for missing shipments is needed because arrivals have consistently concluded with lead_time=0.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Recent demand has risen and become more volatile (Periods 21-23: 137, 93, 53); to react to the recent higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, set demand forecast based on the most recent 3 periods. Use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the base stock and cap to current elevated mean and volatility. This addresses zero in-transit and the need to replenish promptly after the large sales spike in Period 21.

All concluded orders have lead_time=0 so promised lead time remains appropriate. To reflect the recent higher demand, I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent 8 weeks (captures P17\u2013P24 high-demand periods) so the OR backend sets a larger base stock while keeping lead time at default to avoid understocking during the sustained spike. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 -> virtually no immediate cover. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many periods showing arrived with lead_time=0), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 137,93,53,47,79; mean=81.8), so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the new higher regime while keeping responsiveness (mu_hat recent_N N=5). Volatility is also best estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices raise the base-stock to match the recent higher demand while preserving the backend's cap behavior to limit overordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically so use promised/default lead time. Demand has remained in a higher summer regime since Period 14 (sustained higher means through Period 26). To reflect the current summer demand pattern I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 14-26, length=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent summer samples. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (P14-27 mean \u2248 80 over last 14 periods). Observed lead-times in concluded history are consistently 0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while trusting observed lead time data, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and std reflect the last 14 periods (the detected post-changepoint regime). This raises the base-stock to meet the sustained elevated demand while keeping variability estimates tied to the same window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted up since mid-May with sustained higher weekly volumes and volatility (carry-over noted earlier). To react to the new higher regime while limiting sensitivity to one-off spikes, I use recent_N on the last 8 weeks to set demand forecast across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Promised lead time retained (default) because all concluded arrivals so far show 0 actual lead time. Using recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility for safety stock.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a higher summer regime since Period 14 (sustained elevated volumes through Period 29). To capture the current regime I use a recent_N demand estimate spanning the regime length (Periods 14\u201329 = 16 periods). L set to promised (default 0) because concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=16 to reflect the summer demand mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to protect service during the sustained high-demand period while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded order shows lead_time=0). Demand has elevated and volatile since Period 14, with recent weeks showing high weekly demand (Periods 26-30: 62,77,78,59,81). To be responsive to current elevated demand while limiting overstock, I use promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat on the recent 5 demand samples to capture the latest regime. sigma_hat uses default sample-wide volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This gives the OR engine a short, up-to-date demand forecast while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals.

Recent demand shows a sustained summer/high regime (last 8 weeks P24-31 mean \u224873.4 vs earlier lower levels); use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime and recent volatility. This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate focused on the same window.

Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded lead_time=0). Set L=default to use promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent higher-demand regime (captures current weekly demand \xd7(1+L)). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility (~10.6). These parameters steer the OR engine to stock for the recent demand level while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand periods.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (Period14\u201333 regime length=20) so the OR backend targets service for the higher post-changepoint demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand elevated and volatile since the mid-May regime shift (noted in carry-over). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so we are effectively exposed to next period demand. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; use default promised lead time to match observed behavior. Use recent_N (N=8) for demand forecast and volatility to capture the latest high-demand regime (roughly Periods 27\u201334) rather than long-run averages, which would underweight recent spikes. These parameters produce a (1+L)-period demand forecast and tighter sigma reflecting recent variability, helping the OR backend set a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while containing holding cost by using a recent-window estimate.

Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; recent demand shows higher summer peaks but no new sustained changepoint since recorded insights. To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and full historical sample for stable estimates, use default lead time and demand statistics so the OR backend computes base stock from all samples. This balances service (uses all observed demand including elevated summer weeks) against holding cost given current on-hand buffer.

Recent demand shows regime variability with higher midsummer peaks and more moderate values in Sep\u2013Oct; to capture the most relevant recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=8 (covers the last two months of weekly data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend weights recent demand while keeping service for current seasonality and avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and stayed low since Period 35 (demands P35-37 = 45,44,42) \u2014 a sustained low-demand regime of length 3. Use default lead time (promised 0, historically confirmed). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecast and uncertainty to the new low regime, reducing overstock while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 31-38) shows lower, more volatile demand vs earlier peaks; I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the recent mean demand (lower than summer peak). Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while preserving service against recent variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent demand has fallen sharply starting Period 35 (weeks 2019-10-07 onward). On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised lead time. I detect a demand regime change at Period 35 (sustained 5 weeks). Set L=default to trust promised 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower mean demand (so base-stock targets reflect current lower regime). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced short-term volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering given the ~45% drop in demand while preserving service for the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg decreased from 79.38 to 43.40 (-45%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0 so keep L=default. Recent demand declined after Period 35; last 6 concluded demands (P35-P40) = [45,44,42,48,38,40], avg \u2248 42.83. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 -> z*=0).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent demand has settled much lower since the drop around Period 35; last 6 observed demands (P36-41) average \u224841 units/week. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 -> low cover today. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised lead time. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1 -> q=0.5), use recent demand estimates: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 periods to capture the new lower regime and current volatility. This gives the OR backend a base_stock tuned to current demand and avoids overstocking from older high-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show promised lead time 0 observed consistently (orders in P1..P42 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand regime dropped around Period 35 (avg before P35=79.38 -> avg P35-42=43.40; sustained lower demand for 8 periods). Recent spike in Period 42 (115) is a one-week event (likely holiday) and not yet sustained. To adapt to the lower post-P35 regime while avoiding overstock from single-week spikes, set L to default (use promised lead time 0), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime length (N=8) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service (captures current lower demand) vs holding cost and handles no missing shipments evidence.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting at Period 35 (avg dropped from ~79 to ~43, documented in carry-over). Use promised lead time (observed lead_times all 0) so keep L=default. For demand forecast use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (Periods 35\u201343, regime length=9) to capture the post-Period-35 mean and avoid being pulled up by earlier high summer peaks. Set mu_hat recent_N with N=9 and sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean_recent and volatility scaled to the review+lead period; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5, z*=0).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (no evidence of delays), so use promised lead time. Demand history shows prior documented regime shifts but no new sustained change in the last 3+ periods; therefore use default estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), letting OR engine set base_stock from the full-sample mean while sigma uses full-sample volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 41-45)= [40,115,23,53,48] shows high variability with a large spike at P42 (115) but no sustained new regime; demand appears moderate-to-variable heading into Christmas week. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (no evidence to extend). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time. To make the forecast responsive to recent volatility and the P42 spike, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (captures last 5 observed demands) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat so the backend computes mean and std over the same recent window; this balances service level (captures recent high demand) versus holding cost given low on-hand and zero in-transit.

Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=15, in-transit=0; recent demand since the Period35 downward regime has been lower (~40s). No evidence of lead-time deterioration (all concluded arrivals show L=0). To keep service but limit holding cost I use promised lead time (default L=0) and a recent demand estimate to reflect the lower post-P35 regime. I select recent_N=8 to capture the most recent two-month demand behavior (reduces influence of older high summer spikes). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.
