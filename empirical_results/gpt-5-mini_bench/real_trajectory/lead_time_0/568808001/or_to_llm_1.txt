Risk trade-offs: profit = holding cost, so overstock is as costly as one unit of profit lost, therefore avoid extreme over-ordering; but having zero on-hand and no pipeline risks stockouts if demand remains elevated. Decision: increase OR's recommendation moderately to cover likely higher near-term demand while limiting holding risk.

OR baseline: recommended 26 units (OR uses promised L and historical series; its critical fractile q=0.5 yields no safety stock).
