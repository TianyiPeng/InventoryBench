Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a sharp upward shift (samples: 0,0,26,111,277). No concluded arrivals observed (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Use promised lead time to avoid assuming unobserved shipment delays. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 3 samples: 26,111,277) so the OR engine increases target base-stock and caps appropriately while limiting variance dilution from older zero-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: previous two-week avg=0 (2019-01-07,2019-01-14); recent 3-week avg=138 (26,111,277) \u2014 sustained 3 periods of higher demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent demand increased starting 2019-01-21 (noted in carry-over). Latest observed demands: 2019-01-21=26, 2019-01-28=111, 2019-02-04=277, Period1(2019-02-11)=266 \u2014 sustained higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Set L=default since recent conclude shows actual lead time 0 (matches promised). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to focus the forecast and volatility on the four most recent higher-demand periods (captures step-up from prior zero-demand weeks) so the OR backend raises the base stock to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=115, in-transit=0. Two concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2), so set L by calculating average observed lead times. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples since changepoint: 26,111,277 plus recent period demands 266,158 => 5 recent periods). To capture the higher recent mean/variance, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 ((1+L) scaling handled by backend). These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost. No evidence of missing shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Observed concluded lead times for P1\u2013P3 all 0 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (most relevant) shows a higher regime vs early-Jan: last 3 observed demands = 266, 158, 115 (periods 1\u20133). On-hand=142, in-transit=0 so we must cover only the upcoming single-period demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current post-changepoint demand level and volatility (N=3 chosen as the regime length since the demand shift was first seen starting 2019-01-21 and sustained across the last 3 periods). This biases orders toward meeting near-term demand while avoiding excess holding cost given high holding vs modest profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (observed arrivals in Periods 1\u20134 with lead_time=0). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Demand recently settled into a higher regime (carry-over noted: shift starting 2019-01-21). I use a short recent window to capture the post-changepoint demand: set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent demand average (last 3 concluded demands ~158,115,117 \u2192 mean \u2248130) so (1+L)*mean \u2248130. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level for the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has settled after the Jan spike: last 5 demand samples = [266,158,115,117,89], mean=149. On-hand=62, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To reflect the recent regime (sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21) I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) and recent_N volatility over the same window; lead time set from observed history (calculate). This balances service (capture current elevated mean) against holding cost by using recent data rather than historical zeros.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent history shows sustained higher post-2019-01-21 demand; observed lead times in concluded periods 1\u20136 are consistently 0. Current on-hand=112, in-transit=0 (no overdue/lost shipments visible). I set L using calculate to reflect the average observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 concluded weekly demands: 266,158,115,117,89,96) so mu_hat reflects the current higher regime and recent variability; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock anchored to the confirmed higher-demand regime while using recent variance to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed in Periods 1\u20137 all arrived same period) so use promised lead time. Demand rose starting 2019-01-21 and has since been consistently higher (recent concluded demands: 266,158,115,117,89,96,109). To capture the current higher regime and recent variability, I use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base_stock reflecting the new regime while keeping variability from the same window. No new carry-over insight to add.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded orders had lead_time 0), so use default promised lead time. Demand has been elevated since 2019-01-21 (previously recorded); no new sustained changepoint in recent periods. Use backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), allowing the OR engine to compute the base-stock balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20139) show all arrivals had lead_time=0 \u2192 lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has stabilized after the Jan-21 regime shift; last 6 demand samples (Periods 4\u20139) capture the current level while smoothing a couple of spikes. To balance profit ($4) vs holding ($1), use a recent-N demand estimate to keep base-stock responsive to the current regime while keeping variance estimate focused on the same window. L set via calculate (observed average lead time = 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=6 to reflect current demand regime and recent variability, avoiding overweighting older pre-shift zeros.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arrived same-period (observed lead times = 0 consistently), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand over the most recent 5 concluded periods (Periods 6-10): [96,109,137,97,87], recent mean = 105.2. No new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Jan uptick. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the current demand regime and avoid dilution from earlier zeros. This produces a base-stock tuned to current weekly demand while keeping holding costs moderate given low lead time and existing on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has been consistently elevated since 2019-01-21 (sustained higher regime). On-hand=55, in-transit=0, so we need to replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Observed lead times in concluded history are all 0, so set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-regime data; I select N=8 (last 8 demand samples) to capture the current stable elevated demand while smoothing older zero-demand weeks. This balances service level (protect against stockouts given higher recent demand) versus holding cost by not overreacting to older low-demand history.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in history are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Demand shows a sustained regime change in late Jan (noted in carry-over), but recent weeks (Periods 8\u201313 demands = 137,97,87,67,94,47) form a new, lower recent regime (6 periods) with mean \u224888 units. To keep orders responsive to the current run-rate and avoid excess holding cost, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures latest demand regime). L set to default so backend uses promised lead time=0. This concentrates safety stock around recent demand volatility and reduces over-ordering from earlier high spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period ordered). Demand since the January regime shift has stabilized but shows week-to-week variability. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent 8-week mean (weights recent behavior, limits carryover risk). Sigma also set to recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent mean) against holding cost by avoiding outdated large base-stock from early high-demand weeks.

Recent demand has moderated vs. the initial spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [94,47,75,56,48], mean=64. To be responsive to the current regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the last 5 weeks' mean demand across the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. No overdue or missing arrivals in recent conclude messages (all orders have arrived with observed lead_time=0). Prior carry-over noted a demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21; no new sustained changepoint since. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples (scaled by 1+L) to compute base-stock and safety. This balances high service level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.8 against holding cost while avoiding overreaction to short-run fluctuation.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in history arrived same period) so use promised/default lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Recent demand has been lower and more stable than the early 2019 spike; I base demand forecast on the last 10 concluded demand observations (Periods 11\u201320) to reflect the recent regime (mean \u224852.6 units/week) and use the same window for volatility to capture current variability. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces risk of overstock from older high-demand weeks while default L preserves backend lead-time assumption. This balances high target service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) with the current lower demand pattern and existing on-hand stock to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No evidence of lead-time changes (all concluded lead_time=0 historically). Use promised lead time (default L) to keep OR aligned with supplier promise. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=12 to capture the latest sustained post-regime demand level while smoothing older high early-period spikes; same recent_N (N=12) for sigma to reflect current variability. This increases service for current observed demand without overstocking from early-season spike, balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201322) consistently show arrived orders with observed lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of increased or lost lead time. Recent weekly demand has moderated (many weeks in range ~20\u2013120) and the earlier demand regime shift noted in Period 1 (Jan) is already recorded. No new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised L=0) so backend uses full history for demand estimates; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given stable observed lead time and no new signal.

Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) without over-reacting to short recent variability or temporary order gaps.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=94, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded messages show consistent 0-period actual lead time \u2014 use default promised L. Recent demand has settled lower (~20\u201340/week) versus the early Jan spike; use a recent_N forecast to reflect the current regime. I choose recent_N with N=5 (periods 21\u201325 demands = 27,39,24,14,43) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat uses recent volatility from the same window. This keeps orders aligned to current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Inventory is positive but modest relative to weekly demand variability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean since), with no new recent sustained changepoint; to capture the post-shift demand pattern while emphasizing recent behavior, I use recent_N over a long recent window (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the sustained higher-demand regime but remain responsive to recent fluctuations. This balances a high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) against holding cost given current on-hand and zero in-transit inventory.

Recent weekly demand has averaged moderate volumes (recent demands: 14,43,54,74,57) but no new sustained regime shift. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and a high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8), use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history to set the base-stock; this balances service level against holding cost while leveraging all available data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand has settled to ~45\u201355 units recently (Periods 24\u201329: 14,43,54,74,57,44) after the earlier Jan regime shift; I use a recent-window (N=6) forecast for both mean and volatility to reflect the current lower, relatively stable demand and avoid overstock. These parameters give the OR engine a short-horizon demand estimate (L+1 period) and tighter sigma to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost >0.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time=0 (consistent). On-hand + in-transit = 39; no overdue shipments. To balance service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1), use promised/default lead time so backend uses observed sample mean/variance across all historical demand. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample statistics, avoiding overfitting to short blips while reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime detected earlier.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (most recent demands: 48,48,44,57,74,54,43,14,24,39,27,20,33,39,47,48,87-> historical samples show no new sustained jump or drop). On-hand=80, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically, so no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shift. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time; mu_hat=default to use full-sample mean (1+L)*mean across all samples for stable baseline; sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility. These settings balance service level (using full-history mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 18; recent 8-period mean (Periods 25-32) = 52.25 units/week, well below long-run mean (~72). Promised lead time observed constantly 0 in concluded history so use L=default (promised). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, set mu_hat based on recent_N (N=8) to reflect the lower recent demand; set sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base stock and holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: avg decreased from 97.53 (Periods 1-17) to 44.07 (Periods 18-32), \u221254.8%.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand had a one-period spike (Period 33 demand=86) but no sustained regime change; carry-over insights already capture prior sustained shifts. To avoid overreacting to a single high week and to let the OR backend use full-sample statistics, I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively given zero inventory and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P30-P34 = 48,48,50,86,81) shows a modest uptick vs earlier regime (5-sample mean \u224862.6); to capture this short-term shift while limiting inventory risk given $4 profit / $1 holding, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the recent demand level without overcommitting to older data. No overdue/lost shipments detected.

Recent demand has risen vs earlier low regime; last 5 demands = [48,50,86,81,52], recent mean \u224863.4. I keep L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent uptick while limiting sensitivity to a single high week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a lower post-Period-33 regime but last 5 weeks demand = [50,86,81,52,82], mean=70.2. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 consistently; use default lead time. To target a high service level (q \u2248 0.8 given profit $4 / (profit+holding) = 0.8) while limiting holding, set mu_hat based on the recent 5-week mean ((1+L)\xd7mean) to capture current regime and sigma_hat based on recent 5-week volatility. Methods: L=default to trust promised lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent (lower) regime and avoids overstocking against outdated higher-demand samples.

No evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments (all concluded lead_time=0). Use L=default (promised 0) and recent_N for demand to capture the recent elevated demand while keeping responsiveness high; match sigma to recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (orders consistently arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Prior carry-over identified a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 and a later decrease around Period 18; no new sustained changepoint in the most recent history (last ~10 periods shows intermittent demand 48\u201393). I select L=default so the OR engine uses promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set\u2014this leverages all historical demand while the confirmed lead time=0 minimizes pipeline uncertainty and balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand since the last recorded regime change (Period 33) shows elevated and more volatile weekly demand (Periods 34-39: 81,52,82,93,60,51) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Set L to promised/default (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length 6) so the OR engine targets the current demand level/volatility and balances service-level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 34-40) = [81,52,82,93,60,51,49], recent mean ~68.6/week. To keep the base-stock responsive to the latest post-regime demand while limiting holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast and volatility based on the last 7 observed weeks (captures the immediate post-stockout trade-up in weeks 34\u201336 and the stabilization thereafter). This balances service level (capture elevated recent mean) against holding costs given modest on-hand and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent carry-over insights already captured past demand regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint detected. Given stable observed lead time and broad demand history, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high target service level (q\u22480.80); defaults use full-sample moments to reflect seasonality and past regimes while the backend will set safety stock accordingly.

Recent demand has been variable (no new sustained regime change since prior carry-over insights).

Recent demand (Periods 39-44) shows moderate activity with one spike (119 in Period 42); to keep responsiveness to recent pattern while limiting holding cost, I use recent_N over the last 6 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L uses default (promised = 0). This raises the base-stock to cover the immediate (L+1) period demand using recent realized demand and recent variability to balance service level versus holding cost.

No new sustained demand regime detected (previous shifts already recorded). I keep L=default (promised 0). To reflect recent level/volatility and react to short-term holiday variability, I use recent_N for demand and sigma over the last 8 weeks (balances responsiveness vs noise). This keeps the OR base-stock focused on recent demand while the backend caps orders by its safety-cap calculation, limiting excess inventory and holding cost risk.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Demand shows a regime change earlier in the year; to focus the forecast on the current seasonal/regime behavior I use the most recent 13 weeks (Periods 34-46) for both mean and volatility to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (captures recent elevated holiday demand spikes) against holding cost by avoiding overly large estimates driven by older data.
