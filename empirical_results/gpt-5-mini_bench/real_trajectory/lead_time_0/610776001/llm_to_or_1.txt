Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit; five weekly historical samples (145,144,105,181,212) show no recent regime change. Promised lead time is 0 and no concluded arrivals exist to suggest longer lead time or lost shipments. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting to sparse data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 sold 192 (demand 206, stockout). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last Period1 order of 192 arrived with observed lead_time=0. No sustained change in demand or lead time (only one high-demand period). Use promised/default lead time to keep backend expectation aligned with observations and use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine uses full historical sample base while avoiding overreacting to a single high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent observed demands (Period1 demand=206, Period2 demand=239) exceed older sample mean (\u2248157), suggesting upward pressure but only two high periods so not yet a sustained regime change. Lead times observed in concluded history are 0 periods. To balance service vs holding cost I use inferred lead time average, an EWMA forecast to weight recent high demand (gamma=0.5) without overcommitting, and default sigma to reflect full-sample volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1-3 are all 0 \u2192 use calculated lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) = [206,239,350], markedly above historical pre-period mean (~157); detect a sustained upward regime over the last 3 periods. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma from the same recent window ensures safety stock reflects increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 1-3 avg demand = 265 vs historical avg \u2248157 (+68%); treat as new higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $971.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 1-3 avg=265 vs older historical \u2248157). On-hand=69, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 with consistent observed lead_time=0. To capture the new regime I use recent demand estimates over the most recent 3 periods (regime length=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility; keep L as default since observed lead time has been consistently 0. This raises the base-stock to better cover (1+L) periods of demand while the sigma estimate targets appropriate safety stock against variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has shifted higher (Period4+): recent demands P3-P5 = [350,260,245], on-hand=88, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L by calculating observed average. To reflect the detected higher-demand regime while remaining robust to limited regime length, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) so the OR backend targets stock for the recent elevated demand (with L incorporated downstream). This balances service (capture higher recent mean) vs holding cost by using a short recent window rather than all historical data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent weeks (Periods 4-6) show a sustained higher-demand regime (~260,245,242). On-hand=91, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new regime (Periods 4-6 average demand) and pass that (1+L)*mean to the OR engine. Sigma set recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the confirmed higher demand while keeping holding risk controlled by using only the recent regime samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P7 arrived same period). Demand has shifted up since Period 4; recent regime (Periods 4-7) shows higher mean (~299). I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 4-7) so the OR base-stock targets higher service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = $1. This addresses potential understocking from the upward shift without overcommitting inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. Demand since Period 4 is higher (P4-P8 mean \u2248315). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and estimate demand using the most recent 5 periods (P4\u2013P8). Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the higher regime while keeping volatility based on recent variation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=111, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 so I keep L=default (promised 0). A sustained higher-demand regime was detected at Period 4 (carry-over insight) \u2014 recent demand (Periods 4\u20139 = 260,245,242,448,382,284) reflects this. I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the regime length) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 6 periods, which raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma captures recent volatility. This balances service level (reduce stockouts under new regime) against holding cost given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P10 all arrived same period), so use promised/default L. Recent demand is elevated vs earlier history (last 5 demands: 242,448,382,284,273 -> mean \u2248325.8); I therefore set demand forecast using a recent_N window to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping volatility aligned to the same window. This raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts observed in recent high-demand weeks while capping orders via the OR engine to limit excess holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so set L by observed average. A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 (higher demand since Period 4); use recent samples from that regime to estimate demand mean and volatility. With L=0, we must cover (1+L)=1 period of demand; using recent_N=8 (Periods 4\u201311) captures the new regime length and provides stable estimates while meeting the changepoint detection rule. These parameters bias the base-stock toward the higher recent demand to avoid stockouts while sigma from the same window controls the safety-stock cap against excessive holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand shifted to a higher regime beginning Period 4; recent periods (P4\u2013P12) show substantially higher weekly demand vs pre-shift. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, keep L as default (promised=0) and set demand estimates from the recent high-demand regime using recent_N=9 (captures Period 4\u201312). Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so choose lead time method 'calculate' (avg observed = 0). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 (higher mean persistently through recent weeks). To capture the new regime I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility (Periods 4\u201313 are 10 samples), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=10. This biases the base stock toward the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time estimate accurate, balancing service level (avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime) against holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent weeks (Periods 7\u201314) show a sustained higher-demand regime vs early history; to capture current demand level I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 8 observed weeks (Periods 7\u201314). This raises the forecasted (1+L)-period demand and increases safety stock to reduce stockouts given zero in-transit. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect observed lead time=0; mu_hat recent_N to track higher recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by basing targets on the current higher-demand regime rather than older low-demand data.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently zero observed lead time; no overdue or lost shipments. A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 (higher-demand regime); I therefore use recent data from the post-changepoint regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture the post-Period-4 higher mean over the most recent 12 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. This biases the base-stock toward the new higher-demand regime to reduce stockouts while the sigma choice keeps safety stock tuned to recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 for all observed orders, so use promised/default lead time. A sustained higher-demand regime began at Period 4 and persists through Period 16 (use recent data from that regime). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current high-demand regime (Periods 4\u201316, N=13) so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to the elevated mean and volatility, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders in Period X arrived in Period X), so use promised/default lead time. A sustained higher-demand regime was detected at Period 4 (Periods 4\u201317 show elevated demand vs earlier history); to capture the post-change demand level while remaining responsive, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime length (Periods 4\u201317 -> N=14). This lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the recent higher-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4 (carry-over noted) and all observed lead times = 0. On-hand=64, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time to keep backend assumption aligned with observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=15 (covers Periods 4\u201318 inclusive) to capture the new higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the elevated mean and recent volatility, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has settled at a higher regime since Period 4 (historical samples much lower). On-hand=50, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculate to let backend confirm avg lead time=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, forecast demand using the recent 10 weeks (captures latest patterns while smoothing noise). Use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap around current demand mean and volatility, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and holding cost exposure given low pipeline.

A demand regime shift was previously detected at Period 4 (sustained higher demand since P4); therefore I use recent demand (post-changepoint) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the higher regime. I select recent_N with N=17 (Periods 4\u201320) to capture the new regime length and provide stable mean/volatility estimates; L left as default=promised (0) to reflect confirmed observations. This balances service (avoid stockouts in higher-demand regime) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from recent higher mean and measured variability.

Recent demand has settled higher than early historical samples; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21) average \u2248310.6 units/week, so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current higher-demand regime. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices (L=default, mu_hat recent_N N=5, sigma_hat recent_N N=5) raise the base-stock to protect service level under the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so keep L=default. To reflect the sustained higher regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=19 (Periods 4\u201322) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean capturing the new baseline. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=19 to capture recent volatility rather than long-run variability. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding over-weighting older, lower-demand history, balancing service level (profit) against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Recent weekly demand has trended lower (Periods 20-23: 326, 223, 173, 161) vs earlier high regime; to adapt quickly I use a short recent window for demand forecast. Promised lead time and observed lead times remain 0 historically, so use default L. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand level while smoothing noise. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (responsive to recent lower demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=145, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained downward shift starting Period 21 (demands 223,173,161,173) with recent average ~182.5, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 each period, so keep L as promised (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the four-period recent regime; this keeps the OR base-stock focused on the current lower-demand regime and avoids overstock given holding cost. No evidence of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand P21-P24 = 182.5 (223,173,161,173), down ~40% from earlier ~300s; treat as new lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:

All concluded lead-times = 0 so use promised lead time. To reflect the new lower-demand regime and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (captures the downturn while smoothing a bit). This balances service (cover current + lead period demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Current on-hand=106, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 (demands P21-P26 = 223,173,161,173,111,96). Promised lead time has been reliable at 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To capture the recent lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length = 6), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 6 samples. This balances reducing on-hand holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed lower-demand regime. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent weeks show the lower-demand regime identified at Period 21 (weekly demand ~223\u2192173\u2192161\u2192173\u2192111\u219296\u219284). On-hand=112, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue or lost arrivals visible. Use promised lead time (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to reflect the sustained lower regime: choose N=7 (Periods 21\u201327) which captures the full post-changepoint window. Apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the lower, current demand, reducing excess holding while maintaining service for the new regime.

No overdue shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (historical concludes confirm 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new lower-demand regime (most recent 8 weeks) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and reduced cap, balancing profit vs holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime identified earlier (changepoint at P21): P21-P29 demands = [223,173,161,173,111,96,84,110,109], recent average \u2248143. On-hand=73, in-transit=0 so no incoming units; promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (orders from P1\u2013P29 all arrived same period). I select L=default to use the promised 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime (regime length=9 periods P21\u2013P29) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of those 9 recent samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned to the new lower demand, avoid overstock and reduce holding cost while preserving service for the sustained lower-demand regime.

All observed lead times = 0, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 21-30) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a smaller base stock and limits holding cost while maintaining service. This balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) given current lower demand and no in-transit cover.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has stayed in the lower regime identified previously (P21\u2013P32 avg ~110\u219270 trend); on-hand=36, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs recent weekly demand (~70\u2013110). All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 historically. I choose to keep L as default (promised 0) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history; this balances service level with holding cost given the confirmed lower-demand regime and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. No explicit upward adjustment to mu_hat to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 and modest profit per unit=$4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand = 250, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use default promised lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N demand estimates over the current regime (Period 21\u201333, 13 observations) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the new lower mean and reduced volatility; this keeps base-stock tight to avoid excess holding cost given low demand and holding cost = $1 vs profit $4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=204, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments observed; recent demand has been at the lower regime since ~Period 21 (weekly demands mostly ~70\u2013173, last 10 weeks especially low). Promised lead time historically observed = 0 periods in concluded messages, so use default L to match promise. To align forecasting with the sustained lower-demand regime (regime start ~P21, length 14 periods through P34), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant samples. This reduces target base-stock and cap, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the confirmed lower-demand regime given profit=$4 and holding=$1 tradeoff.

I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 weeks, capturing the clear recent decline and avoiding excess stock. I also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for current low-demand regime given holding cost >0.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically. Demand has shifted to the lower regime that began around Period 21 (avg ~182.5 then drifting lower); recent weeks show persistently low weekly demand (Periods 30-36 avg \u224859). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N to prioritize the most recent low-demand data (regime length since P21 \u224816 periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 16 demand samples. This reduces target base-stock vs earlier high-demand regime and lowers overstock risk while keeping service given current low demand and zero in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has fallen sharply since Period 33 (P33-P37: 74,46,34,43,49) indicating a new low-demand regime versus the earlier lower regime (P21-P24 avg=182.5). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0 for many periods, so use default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5-week regime (captures current low demand). This yields lower base_stock and tighter cap to reduce overstock risk given high holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg demand P33-P37 = 49.2 (74,46,34,43,49), down ~73% from P21-P24 avg 182.5; treat as new sustained low-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled into the sustained low-demand regime detected at Period 33: recent demands P33-P38 = [74,46,34,43,49,24], recent average \u224845.7 units. On-hand=76, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock covers ~1.7 periods of recent demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. No evidence of lead-time slips (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L=default to trust promised 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (regime length since Period 33 = 6) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last 6 samples), and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce orders to align with the new lower-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute an appropriate service-level-based base stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Current on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Recent history shows the sustained low-demand regime beginning at Period 33 (P33-P37 avg \u224849.2), confirmed by 5 consecutive low weeks (74,46,34,43,49) and continued low demand in P38-P39 (24,43). No overdue arrivals observed. I set L=default because all concluded lead-time observations are 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples), which reduces target base stock and lowers holding cost while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the sustained low-demand regime detected earlier (Periods 33\u201340 avg \u224838 units/week). Observed lead times historically = 0 (no evidence of shift). To keep inventory appropriate for the low regime and limit holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand samples. I choose recent_N=8 to cover the most recent 8 weeks (P34\u2013P41 history) representing the current regime; this keeps target base-stock small and reduces excess holding while maintaining service.

No evidence of lead-time change (observed lead_time=0 consistently). To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised lead time and base demand on the recent low-demand regime (capture last 9 concluded periods from the changepoint at P33). Selected methods: L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to scale forecast to (1+L) periods using the most recent low-demand data, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to reflect current low volatility.

Demand has been in the sustained low-demand regime since Period 33 (recent demands: P33-P42 = 74,46,34,43,49,24,43,30,25,47). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead_time=0. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the confirmed low-demand regime (N chosen = 10 recent periods in the regime). This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand pattern.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=34, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0, so use default L. To reflect the new low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest low-demand weeks (captures (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 5 samples). This keeps target stock low to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the current low demand pattern.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=24, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost arrivals observed (historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=12 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the full low-demand regime since Period 33 (regime length=12), so the forecast reflects the lower sustained demand while smoothing week-to-week noise. I choose sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to capture volatility in the same recent low-demand window.

LLM Rationale:

Last 13 periods since P33 show low weekly demand (examples P33-P45: 74,46,34,43,49,24,43,30,25,47,20,19,35; recent avg \u224829). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0), so use default L to keep backend lead time = promised. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align forecast and volatility with the confirmed low-demand regime so the OR engine sets a much lower base-stock and avoids excess holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals; no evidence of lost shipments and historical lead times have been consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates, using N=14 (regime length P33\u2013P46 = 14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 14 samples; this reduces bias from earlier high-demand periods and tightens the forecast/volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given current low demand and non-negligible holding cost.
