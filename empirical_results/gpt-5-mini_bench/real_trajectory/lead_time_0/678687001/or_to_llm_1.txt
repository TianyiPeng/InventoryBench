Recent realized demands (Periods 5-9) = [118,100,123,182,101] show a recent-average \u2248124.8 with a one large spike (182) in Period 8; this suggests slightly higher short-run mean but not a sustained regime shift.

Rationale: with confirmed L=0, current period demand will be satisfied from on-hand+arrivals this period; ordering 80 adds to same-period availability and keeps target base-stock near recent demand (\u2248125) without exposing us to excessive holding cost (profit=holding so overstock is costly).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), so orders placed now would arrive during this period's arrival phase and be available for demand this period. Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand analysis: long-run demand has fallen from historical ~111 down through mid-year to low 20\u201340s (carry-over insights). Very large recent spikes in Periods 45\u201346 (409, 338) and Period 42 (136) coincide with late-December holiday weeks and are short-lived (2\u20133 periods) rather than a sustained regime shift. OR baseline=84 uses historical averages and promised lead time; with profit=holding cost the OR critical fractile implies little safety stock, but OR cap/mean yields 84. Strategy: avoid overstocking for a likely transient holiday surge given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and lead time=0 (we can respond next period if demand persists). Place a conservative order to cover expected post-holiday demand (~30 units) to balance missed sales risk vs holding cost. If high demand persists next period, raise orders then (lead time 0 allows quick response).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 84\u219230: lead time confirmed 0 and Dec spikes (409,338) look temporary holiday surges; prefer conservative stocking to avoid high holding cost while remaining able to respond next period.",
