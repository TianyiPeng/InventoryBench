Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (13,21,55,47,23) give mean \u224831.8. No evidence of changepoint or delayed arrivals yet. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring standard base-stock sizing.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 showed an order with observed lead_time=0 (arrived same period). Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean \u224831.8 with one large observed demand spike in Period 1 (demand=79) that is not yet a sustained regime change. Use promised/default lead time to keep model aligned with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overreacting to a single spike while letting the OR engine compute service-level stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Two concluded arrivals show actual lead times = 0 periods, demand in the last two weeks (79,115) is higher than the Jan historical samples but not yet a 3+ period sustained shift. To avoid overreacting to a short spike, set lead time based on observed data and keep demand and volatility estimates using the full-sample defaults so the OR engine uses conservative base-stock sizing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P3) show actual lead_time=0 each. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical older weekly samples (Jan) had mean ~31.8, but last 3 observed demands (period concluded demands 79,115,96) indicate a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime ((79+115+96)/3 \u224896.7). This raises the base_stock appropriately to meet service while avoiding excessive holding given high holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Periods 1\u20133): avg demand increased from 31.8 (historical Jan samples) to 96.7 over the last 3 concluded periods (+204%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded periods (P2\u2013P4) show elevated demand vs historical Jan samples; actual lead time has been consistently 0 (observed arrivals in P1\u2013P4). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we must cover imminent demand. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (latest 3 concluded demands P2\u2013P4 avg \u2248109.3) to capture the new higher regime; sigma also recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders up to satisfy higher current demand while leveraging that lead time is 0, balancing service level vs holding cost (profit=holding so target z\u22480).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 Period 6. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for Periods 1\u20135). Demand has been elevated recently; using the most recent 3 concluded demand observations to capture the new regime while keeping L at promised 0. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the higher short-term mean while using recent volatility for service-level sizing and avoiding excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6) = [117, 81, 92], recent average \u224896.7 over last 3 periods, clearly above historical Jan samples. All observed lead times from concluded messages = 0. I use default L (promised lead time=0). To capture the new higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). To reflect recent variability, I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 (uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 3 samples). This favors stocking to meet the sustained higher demand while the backend will cap orders to limit risk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders arriving same period). Demand showed a sustained upward regime starting Period 4; recent demand (Periods 5-7 = 81,92,95) averages ~89.3. No shipments are overdue. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed=0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent weeks. This balances service (match current elevated demand) versus holding cost by limiting forecasting window to the confirmed recent regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand shows a sharp spike in Period 8 (190) after three higher-volume periods (P6=92, P7=95, P8=190). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use default lead time. To capture the recent upward demand regime while remaining responsive to the large P8 spike, set demand forecast using the most recent 3 concluded samples (Periods 6\u20138) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 3). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given current zero on-hand/in-transit while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand history shows elevated and volatile demand (notably Period 8 demand=190; recent periods 79\u2013190, mean ~80 across all 14 samples). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. Current on-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), use promised/default lead time so OR backend retains 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this incorporates the full history including the recent spike while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap rule.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand last 3 concluded periods = [190,101,81], recent mean=124.0 with notable spike at Period 8 but last 3 show elevated level vs earlier Jan samples. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because all observed concludes show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher-demand regime and current volatility; this focuses orders to meet (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scaled recent std, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 neutral z).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded demands (P1\u2013P11) show a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 4; on-hand=50, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 with all observed lead_times=0. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 4\u201311) to capture the post-changepoint regime mean for mu_hat and its volatility for sigma_hat; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the higher sustained demand while avoiding dilution by the much lower historical Jan samples. This balances service level (meet elevated demand) against holding cost given current inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; concluded history shows all past orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand clearly shifted upward starting at Period 4 and has persisted; to capture the post-changepoint regime I use recent_N over the recent regime (Periods 4\u201312). Thus: L=default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 (covers Periods 4\u201312) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 samples, which balances higher recent demand with the equal profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313) show a higher sustained regime vs. initial Jan samples; on-hand=32, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (observed lead times all 0). Forecast demand using recent data to capture the new higher regime: set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 concluded periods (captures recent mean \u224886 units/week * (1+L)). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps safety stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P14 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated vs. Jan baseline, but the increase was already recorded previously (Period 4 insight). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the engine computes base_stock from the full sample mean and std. This balances service (use full-sample demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so set L based on observed lead times. Recent demand shows a higher post-Jan regime; use the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201315: 74,104,72,81,96) to capture the current demand level (mean=85.4) and recent volatility. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1/$1) so the backend target service quantile is 0.5; using recent demand stats aligns base-stock with current realized demand while avoiding excess holding. No shipments appear overdue in concluded history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 concluded demands: 104,72,81,96,243). To balance service vs holding cost I use a short recent window (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the raised recent mean without overreacting to a single spike; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 3 concluded demands: 96, 243, 178) so use a short recent-window forecast to capture the current regime while keeping lead time at the promised value (all observed lead_times = 0). Set L=default to trust promised 0. Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples and capture the current high mean. Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase service against current high demand while limiting excess inventory by using a small, evidence-based window.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). SKU 711053003 on-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (orders always arrived same period). Recent history includes high, variable weekly demand (several large spikes) but no new sustained regime change since prior recorded insight. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations and its assumed lead time, I use default settings: L=promised (0), mu_hat and sigma_hat = backend defaults computed from all samples. This leverages full-sample statistics to balance service vs. holding costs given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (demands: P16=243, P17=178, P18=132, P19=273) vs earlier weeks. No overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 concluded demands) and sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect current volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk bounded by using only the recent regime data.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (orders in history show arrived same period), so use promised lead time (default). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime in recent weeks (Periods 16\u201320 demands = 243, 120, 132, 273, 201 with several very large weeks and earlier noted regime shift at Period 4). To make the order policy responsive to the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the recent elevated mean and volatility while respecting the N rules). These parameters will raise the base-stock to improve service while sigma_hat from recent data informs safety stock; L=default preserves correct lead-time assumption from concluded data.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent concluded history shows substantially higher weekly demand since Period 4; on-hand=46, in-transit=0, so current inventory is modest vs. recent weekly sales (often >100). All observed concluded lead times = 0 so use default promised lead time. To let the OR backend use full historical mean/variance (stable long-run estimate) and because no new 3+ period sustained change beyond the previously recorded insight is being added, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level given profit=holding cost by letting OR compute z from profit ratio.

Recent demand (Periods 18\u201322 = 132, 273, 201, 160, 109) shows a higher regime; I use recent_N N=5 to capture the current elevated mean/volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base stock to cover current demand without relying on stale January samples.

Recent demand has risen and is volatile (last 5 concluded demands: P19-23 = 273,201,160,109,268; mean\u2248202), so forecast using recent_N=5 to capture the current higher regime; same recent_N=5 for volatility to reflect current variance.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been persistently higher than the historical Jan samples (sustained high weekly sales since Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must rebuild pipeline to meet elevated demand. Use promised lead time (default) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher regime across the last 10 concluded periods (reduces bias from older low-Jan samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility and avoid under/over-stocking from older variance estimates. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while sigma_hat informs safety stock so the OR backend balances profit vs holding cost.

To reflect the sustained higher recent demand I set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, which biases stocking toward the current higher-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has settled above historical Jan levels; last 5 concluded demands = [216,168,121,106,99], mean \u2248142. On-hand=50, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). All observed lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to trust supplier; set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting current elevated demand while avoiding over-reliance on long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P29 arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 concluded demands: 168,121,106,99,259) so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current regime. I set L to default (promised lead time 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand level and volatility (captures current spike and variability) so the OR backend will size base stock to serve the (1+L) period and balance profit vs holding cost given high recent demand and zero promised lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u201330), so use default promised lead time. Recent weeks show elevated, variable demand but previous carry-over recorded the major regime shift; no new 3+ period sustained change detected, so use default demand/volatility estimators. Profit=$1 and Holding=$1 imply q=0.5 (z*=0) which the OR backend will apply when computing base stock.

All observed lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand weeks, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current demand level and variance. This balances service (reduce lost sales) vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every conclude shows arrived same period). Recent demand is elevated vs early Jan samples; last 5 concluded demands = [99,259,179,214,141], mean \u2248178.4 and std supports higher volatility. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (covers last 5 periods where demand averaged \u2248178), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Recent demand remains at an elevated regime vs the Jan samples; last 3 concluded demands = [214,141,177], recent mean \u2248177.3. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 weeks \u2248177.3) so the base-stock targets recent demand rather than diluted long-run Jan means. I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (reduce lost sales) given very low on-hand and no pipeline, while keeping holding exposure limited by using a short recent window rather than long-term higher variance.

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Periods 1\u20133 shift noted earlier, but no new sustained changepoint since last insight. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Recent demand is elevated compared to early Jan samples but no new sustained changepoint since prior Period 4 insight. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full historical demand stats, use default lead time and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while ensuring pipeline targets cover current review+lead period. Defaults also respect that there are no in-transit units to cover upcoming demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover; recent demand regime is higher than the small historical Jan samples. I use promised lead time (default) since concluded history shows L=0 consistently. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (post-Period 4) while capping lookback to 20 weeks; same window for sigma to reflect recent variability. This provides the OR backend an up-to-date (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility focused on the current high-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent history shows sustained higher weekly demand vs the very small Jan samples; no outstanding arrivals or lost shipments visible in concluded history. I keep L at default (promised lead time=0) since concluded messages consistently show 0-period arrivals. To let the OR engine use full historical demand evidence and its built-in caps, I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (uses long-run mean/variance) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0, so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand (Periods 37-39) = [185,146,85], showing elevated but variable demand; use recent_N for mu_hat to focus the (1+L) forecast on the latest regime (N=3). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while avoiding overweighting older, different regimes and limits holding costs given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (many periods with 'lead_time was 0'), so use recent demand to set forecasts. Recent demand (Periods 36-40) = [108,185,146,85,162], avg \u2248137.2 units/week. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Choose L by calculation of observed lead times would yield 0, but use default promised lead time behavior by referencing recent demand window. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture current demand regime (N=5) so (1+L)*mean reflects current higher-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and avoid under/over-stocking given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 service quantile 0.5); this lets the OR engine compute base_stock appropriate to recent mean and volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=79, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments observed (historical concluded lead times = 0). Recent demand volatile; to react to short-term changes I use a recent window to set demand forecast and volatility so base-stock adapts quickly while keeping L as promised (0). Chosen L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. Chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to weight the last 5 demand observations and capture current demand level and variability for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (respond to recent high demand weeks) vs holding cost by avoiding long-term averaging that would keep excessive inventory from older high-demand regimes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (pre-December season). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no concluded late/missing arrivals. Recent realized demand is variable but elevated in some weeks (Periods 38-42 demands: 146,85,162,59,126). To respond to recent volatility and possible holiday demand without asserting a permanent regime change, set lead time to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent weeks more heavily while limiting overreaction.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=63, in-transit=0. No overdue arrivals observed; historical lead times have all been 0. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: Periods 41-43) = [59, 126, 53], showing a higher regime than the original Jan samples. To capture the recent regime while keeping lead time at the promised 0, I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to recent demand patterns and avoids understocking.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0) so use promised/default L. Recent demand remains elevated vs. early-Jan historical baseline; to capture current regime and be responsive I use a short recent window for demand forecast. Chosen: L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent 5 demand samples; sigma_hat=default to provide volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) vs. holding cost given limited on-hand and no in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas). Recent concluded demand has fallen (Periods 43-45: 53, 35, 47). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the near-term holiday demand dip I use recent_N (last 3) for demand mean and volatility; keep L as default (promised=0). This biases orders down to avoid holding cost while reflecting the latest regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical Jan samples mean=31.8 but recent weeks show higher and volatile demand (Periods 42-46 demands = 126,53,35,47,120). Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0), so use default L to let backend assume promised behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility (includes the large 126 and 120 observations) so the OR engine will raise base-stock for higher recent demand while accounting for higher variance. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments needed (no overdue arrivals in conclude history).
