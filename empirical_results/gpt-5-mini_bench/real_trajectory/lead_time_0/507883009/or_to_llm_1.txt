Subtract on-hand 25 \u2192 order \u224876 units. Cap not applied because pipeline=0 but order size is moderate and avoids excessive holding cost.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Current inventory: on-hand=36, in-transit=0. OR recommends 134 using full-history base-stock cap; that yields on-hand+arrival=170 before demand. Recent weeks show moderate demand (~65\u2013110, recent 5-week avg \u224872) but historical demand often runs higher (many weeks 100\u2013200). With LT=0, orders immediately cover this period's demand; ordering OR's 134 balances stockout risk from historically higher demand while limiting excess holding (holding cost=$1/unit).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history through Period 46 shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0), so orders placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Inventory/demand: on-hand=119, in-transit=0. Recent demands (P43\u2013P46) = {49,67,65,51} averaging ~58; seasonal calendar (2019-12-30) and recent weeks show subdued demand, not a spike. OR recommends 50, but that policy ignores current on-hand. With profit $4 and holding $1, overstock is penalized; on-hand 119 already covers ~2 weeks of recent demand and exceeds OR's single-period target. Strategy: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while same-period lead time ensures we can top up in future periods if demand rises. Monitor next periods and order only if on-hand + concluded arrivals drop below target coverage.",
