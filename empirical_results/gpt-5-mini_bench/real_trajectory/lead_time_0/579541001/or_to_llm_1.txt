  "rationale": "Lead time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (previous carry-over insight Period 5). Therefore orders arrive same period they are placed and we only need to cover this period's demand to avoid holding cost. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 22, in-transit = 0. Recent demands (P42\u2013P46): 120, 69, 105, 136, 109 \u2192 recent average \u2248108 units/week. OR recommends 133 (uses long-run history and promised L), which would create excess ending inventory given equal profit and holding cost. Final strategy: order to meet one-period expected demand minus on-hand: 108 \u2212 22 = 86 \u2192 round conservatively to 88 units to allow small buffer for variability while avoiding large holding cost. This follows that with profit=holding, overstock is costly; with L=0 we target one-period demand coverage. ",
