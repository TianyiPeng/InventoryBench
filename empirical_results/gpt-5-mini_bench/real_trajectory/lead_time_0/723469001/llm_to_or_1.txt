Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead time changes. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~63 units/week. Promised lead time used (default). Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service vs holding cost with no evidence of recent regime shift or delayed shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History: two orders (P1,P2) both concluded as arrived in same period they were ordered (lead_time observed = 0 twice). Demand history available (historical sample mean ~63) with a single large observed demand in Period 2 (118) but only two recent periods\u2014insufficient sustained changepoint. I therefore set lead time by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use the default aggregate forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to avoid overreacting to a single spike. Volatility uses the default full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given no sustained regime change and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all had lead_time=0 (consistent same-period arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent sales were 43,118,84 and historical weekly sample mean=63 (samples:85,71,74,49,36). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast (mu_hat\u224863) and volatility for safety given recent variability while avoiding overreaction to one high week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent observed concluded demands (Periods 1-4) = [43,118,84,69], on-hand=1, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded orders; demand appears to have shifted higher versus the older Jan samples (mean of older samples=63). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded lead times are consistently 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 4 concluded demands (mean=78.5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost considerations (profit=holding cost -> service quantile = 0.5) and cap constraints handled by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 1-4 avg demand = 78.5 vs prior sample avg = 63.0 (+24%), sustained for 4 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: Periods 1-4 avg = 78.5 vs prior sample avg = 63 (+24%) and Period 5 demand 47 leaves on-hand=32, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To respond to the detected higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, keep L at promised (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (use the most recent 4 periods of observed demand to capture the regime shift). This biases the OR engine toward replenishing to cover the new higher mean and uses recent variance for service-level sizing.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across concluded periods), so use promised/default lead time. Recent history: a previously noted demand regime shift (Periods 1-4 avg=78.5 vs prior 63.0) exists but the last two concluded demands (Periods 5-6 = 47,49) are lower \u2014 signal is mixed and not yet a new sustained regime. To avoid overreacting to short-term noise, use default demand stats (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full sample set while honoring observed lead time=0. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Observed actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P7). Recent demand (Periods 4\u20137: 69,47,49,59) averaged ~56, lower than earlier spike. To respond quickly without overstocking, keep L=default (promised=0) and use recent demand for the review+lead period: mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect the newest regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture recent variability. This tightens orders to current demand levels and limits holding cost while preserving service given same-period arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to meet immediate demand. Historical concluded lead times = 0 in all periods, so set L via calculate (avg observed lead time = 0). Recent demand shows a higher and more variable regime (large spikes in P2 and P8); to capture current mean/volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the most recent demand regime and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show every observed order arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent across Periods 1\u20139). Demand regime shift was recorded at Period 5 (sustained higher mean since then). To capture the post-changepoint regime I set L to default (promised=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5\u20139) to reflect the sustained higher demand, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility including the large spikes in Periods 8\u20139. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data controls safety-stock sizing to limit excess holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P10 all arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a higher regime since Period 5; last 5 demands (P6\u2013P10 = 49,59,121,110,73) average ~82.4 with elevated volatility. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to respond to the sustained higher mean and for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (reduce stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the most relevant recent regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand has been volatile with several high weeks (Periods 8-11: 121,110,73,76) so I bias forecast to the most recent regime. I set L=default to keep backend lead time at 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 concluded demands) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while sigma captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand and no pipeline) against holding cost by relying on short lead-time policy and recent-demand statistics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-12) show all arrivals with lead_time=0 so keep L as promised. Demand has been persistently higher since the regime shift detected at Period 5 (sustained elevated demand); to capture the post-shift regime I use recent_N on the most recent 8 weeks (Periods 5-12) for both central forecast and volatility so the OR engine targets service for the new higher mean while accounting for recent variability. This balances profit vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand rather than the older lower-demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded orders arrived same period). Recent demand has varied but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Period 5 shift. Given profit=holding, target service quantile q=0.5 so conservative choice is to use default demand estimates (use all samples) and default volatility; keep L at promised (default=0). This keeps base_stock = population mean demand across review+lead and balances service vs. holding cost with no evidence of delayed or lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Historical concluded lead times are all 0 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P14 all arrived same period), so set L to 'calculate' (avg observed = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime identified earlier (Period 5 shift), but no new changepoint since. Use default demand scaling: mu_hat='default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat='default' (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates while respecting observed lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent sales show a sustained higher regime detected at Period 5 (user note): recent demand elevated vs original sample. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (no missing shipments). To be responsive to the confirmed higher recent demand I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility (captures the last regime). I keep L=default since concluded history confirms promised lead time = 0. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets the (1+L)-period demand under the recent regime, increasing service while holding cost equals profit so this balances fill vs inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand has a known regime shift recorded at Period 5 (higher mean) but no new sustained change in the last 3+ periods (recent spike in Period 16 appears episodic). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and overall demand, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level (uses full sample mean) against holding cost without overfitting a single large spike.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Historical concludes show all past orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent large demands (Periods 16-17: 203, 222) are abrupt but not yet a sustained regime (only 2 periods); earlier carry-over noted Period 5 shift remains. To avoid overreacting to a short burst while preserving service, use promised lead time and default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std) so the OR backend computes base stock from the full-sample mean/variance. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear, sustained spike in Periods 16-18 (203, 222, 157). Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (Periods 16-18). This raises the base-stock to meet the much higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for volatility. This addresses zero pipeline and reduces stockouts at the cost of higher holdings, which is appropriate given profit=holding cost symmetry and the large demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand for Periods 16-18 = 194 vs prior recent avg \u224878.5 (+148%), sustained 3 periods

All concluded lead times = 0, so keep promised lead time. To prioritize service during this confirmed higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the elevated mean and volatility while keeping L default. This raises target base-stock to cover the new regime without assuming longer lead time or lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has stepped up sharply starting Period 16 (periods 16-20 demands = 203,222,157,178,230; recent mean \u2248198). All historical concluded lead_times = 0, so use promised/default L=0. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (covers Periods 16-20) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the sustained spike. Volatility also elevated; use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data, and aligns safety stock to recent variance given equal profit and holding costs.

Demand has a sustained high regime since Period 16 (demands: 203,222,157,178,230,151 \u2014 6 periods). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current higher mean and volatility; L default lets backend apply (1+L) multiplier = 1. This focuses orders on the new high-demand regime while avoiding overly large safety stock given equal profit and holding costs.

Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L=0. Recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7) focuses the OR engine on the elevated demand regime to raise base stock and reduce stockouts while keeping variance estimate aligned with recent volatility.

On-hand=70, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed historically (all arrivals had lead_time=0). To protect service during the sustained high-demand regime, use lead time default (promised=0) and base mu/sigma on the recent high-demand window. Chosen L=default preserves promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 (captures Period16\u201323 elevated mean/volatility) so the OR backend raises base-stock for the new regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand data.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 in every concluded period (consistent, no delays). Demand has been elevated since Period 16 (sustained higher regime); to capture this regime I use recent_N on the most recent 9 demand periods (Periods 16-24). L uses calculated observed lead times (will be 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 to make the OR backend size the base-stock to recent elevated mean and volatility, balancing higher service needs from the sustained demand increase against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Observed lead time consistently 0 in concluded history (orders placed arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Demand shifted up starting Period 16 and has persisted; use recent demand (most recent 10 periods, Periods 16-25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current higher regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts given sustained higher sales) while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Demand has structurally shifted up from Period 16 onward (sustained higher regime); recent 11 periods (P16\u2013P26) reflect the new regime. To capture the elevated demand, set L by calculating observed lead time (will be 0). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock is sized to the higher recent mean and volatility rather than the older low-demand history. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the new high-demand regime) against holding cost by limiting N to the confirmed recent regime length.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in all concluded periods arrived with lead_time=0). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16-27 show higher mean demand ~150+ vs earlier ~78). I set L to default (use promised lead time 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16-27) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices align the backend base-stock toward the new higher demand while keeping lead-time assumptions consistent with observed concluded arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time=0 consistently. Demand has a sustained high regime since Period 16 (elevated weekly demand through Period 28). To capture the sustained regime shift I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 (periods 16\u201328 inclusive) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the confirmed high-demand regime. I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the forecast to avoid stockouts from the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety modest (profit=holding -> q=0.5) to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting around Period 16 (noted in carry-over) but recent weeks (Periods 26-29 demands: 88,130,65,60) are variable; no new sustained changepoint detected. Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample history, letting the solver balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows prior sustained regime shifts already recorded; no new sustained change in the last 3 periods (demands: 65, 60, 59). To keep the OR backend calibrated to long-run data and because no new significant changepoint is observed, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1), and current moderate on-hand inventory covers near-term demand.

No recent missing shipments or new sustained demand regime since last recorded insights. To let the OR engine use full history and current promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Demand showed two prior sustained regime shifts (P1-4 up ~24%; P16-18 large spike) but recent 5-week demand has stabilized around ~62 units (periods 28-32: 65,60,59,58,66). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), I target the short-term recent mean: use default promised lead time (0) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current regime and avoid overstock from earlier spikes. This keeps base_stock responsive to the current lower-rate regime while the OR backend caps orders using its cap formula.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 every observed period (orders always concluded same period). Recent demand regime shifts (Periods 1-4 and 16-18) are recorded in carry-over insights provided. Given zero pipeline and confirmed historical 0 lead time, use default lead time so backend uses promised L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage full-sample demand statistics (captures both pre- and post-regime data) and let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost. This keeps parameters robust to the documented regime shifts while avoiding overfitting to very short recent windows.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 59,58,66,113,44) shows a current short-run mean ~68, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the latest regime while limiting influence of older high-demand spikes. Set L to default (promised 0) to reflect observed stability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target current demand level and recent volatility, which helps the OR backend keep service (avoid stockouts from recent spikes) without inflating holding costs from older high-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has had earlier regime shifts (higher mean since Period 5 and another jump around Periods 16-19) but no new sustained change in the last several weeks; therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/variance (scaled by 1+L). This keeps ordering aligned with observed prompt arrivals while letting the backend's base-stock math balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows all arrivals on-time with observed lead_time=0 consistently. Demand has experienced prior sustained regime shifts (noted in carry-over) but most recent weeks (Periods 30-37) average demand ~61 with some spikes. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Use default lead time to match promised 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no new confirmed regime requiring an explicit override.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in every concluded period \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Significant demand regime shifts were already recorded in carry-over insights (Periods 5 and 19); no new sustained changepoint in the most recent periods. Profit = holding cost (q=0.5) implies z*=0 so base_stock will equal mu_hat; using default methods lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, balancing service vs holding given no new evidence and zero observed in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders consistently arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has varied (notably the mid-year spike already recorded in prior insights) but there is no new sustained changepoint in the last 3+ periods; therefore use default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation consistently. This balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 target z\u22480).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 56,116,88,71,56) reflects current regime (mean \u224877.4) which is lower than the mid-year peak but higher than early samples; to capture the most relevant mean/volatility for the (1+L) review+lead horizon I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps base stock responsive to the current demand regime while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; recent demand has returned to pre-summer levels after large mid-year spikes. No overdue shipments visible. Use default lead time to let backend trust promised L=0 and use full-sample demand stats for base-stock calculation; this balances service (use historical mean) against holding cost given profit=holding so no risk bias needed.

LLM Rationale:
Date Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand shows earlier sustained regime shifts (notably higher mean from Period 16 onward); recent weeks remain variable but reflect the newer higher regime. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding so target service quantile=50%), I use the promised/default lead time and compute demand forecast from the recent regime to capture the sustained uplift. I choose recent_N=20 to weight the last ~20 weeks (captures post-changepoint behavior) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base_stock reflecting the current higher-demand regime while sigma reflects recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained regime change since previously recorded shifts (Period 5 and Period 19). Use default lead time (promised L=0) so OR backend treats arrivals as same-period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost with the standard base-stock formula.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L at promised (default). Demand shows a sustained regime shift earlier (Period 16\u201319 spike) already recorded; more recently (Periods 38\u201344) demand has softened (multiple weeks with low sales in Dec). To make the forecast responsive to the recent downturn and seasonal December softness, use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures roughly the last 10 weeks of demand to adapt mean and volatility while smoothing short noise). This balances service (by using recent higher/ lower demand as appropriate) against holding cost given current high on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has cooled from summer peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 41-45) = [43,88,29,23,63], mean\u224849.2. No arrivals in-transit and no evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals have been LT=0 historically). To avoid stockouts given low on-hand but subdued recent demand, use a short-term recent demand estimate to set forecast and a matching recent volatility estimate. L kept as promised (default=0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N to capture current lower-season regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect recent variability. This balances service (cover immediate demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so solution favors modest provisioning.

Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; recent demand (Periods 42-46 = 88,29,23,63,65) shows lower, volatile December activity after earlier mid-year spikes. To keep service without excess holding (profit=holding so z*=0 \u2192 base_stock = mu_hat), I use the promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current lower-season regime and recent volatility.
