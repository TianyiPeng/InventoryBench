Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent history shows a clear upward shift in weekly demand: samples = [0,0,13,27,26]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the new regime. Set L to promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) while keeping estimates responsive. This increases target base stock to meet higher service needs while sigma_hat based on the same 3 recent samples captures volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg(2019-01-21..2019-02-04)=22 (n=3); prior period avg(2019-01-07..2019-01-14)=0

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent sample means = 22 (periods 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). Period 1 conclude confirms orders with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). To protect service while keeping holding cost low, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast to recent regime: use recent_N with N=3 (the 3-period higher-demand regime). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma to capture current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised LT=0; concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20132 show actual lead time = 0. Recent realized demand is much higher than the older sample window (recent demands: Period1=60, Period2=146). On-hand and in-transit are zero. Because demand has jumped sharply, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (reflect confirmed 0), set mu_hat explicitly to target the recent elevated demand (mean of last 2 realized periods = 103 units for the review+lead horizon), and set sigma_hat explicitly to reflect observed short-term volatility (std \u2248 43 between the two recent periods). These parameters push the OR backend toward a high service level (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost modest.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1866.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples show a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg = 22 units/week). Last three orders all arrived same period (observed lead_time=0). I set L to calculated average observed lead time (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime (captures mean\u224822 and corresponding volatility), which reduces stockouts while keeping holding costs low given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 arrived P2; P3 arrived P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent mean \u224822 over last 3 samples) and confirmed lead time 0 in concluded history. On-hand=70, in-transit=0. To keep service high given the higher recent demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the new higher regime (captures avg of 13/21/27? actually last 3 samples mean= (13+27+26)/3=22) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet increased demand while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand is high and volatile (recent demands: 60,146,102,104,95) vs. earlier low-season samples; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. To capture the recent higher demand regime and current volatility, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demand samples. This increases the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat_recent raises safety stock to maintain service with acceptable holding cost given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has stabilized above historical pre-2019 levels with last 5 period demands = [146,102,104,95,79] (mean \u2248105). On-hand=73, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0, one-period coverage is critical. Use L=default to retain promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime and set base_stock to cover ~1\xd7 recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) while avoiding excessive holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1953.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent sales show a sustained high-demand regime (most recent demands: 102,104,95,79,105). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient vs expected weekly demand (~97). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep promised L. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand samples. This raises the base-stock to meet service level given profit/holding tradeoff and avoids understock due to the recent upward shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1 (2019-02-11): avg demand Period1..Period7 = 98.7 (n=7), up from earlier samples (0\u219222);

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-02-11 (periods 1\u20138: demands 60,146,102,104,95,79,105,114; avg \u2248 101). On-hand=1, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concldues\u2014use promised/default L. To capture the new regime, set demand estimates using recent data (most recent regime length=8 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility and allow the OR engine to size base stock for high demand while holding costs remain low (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent history (Periods 1\u20139) shows a sustained demand regime since 2019-02-11: avg demand \u224898.7 over 9 periods (Period1..9) versus near-zero earlier; lead time has been consistently 0 (arrivals same period). To capture the new high-demand regime I set L to promised (default = 0) and use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 demand samples. This raises the base-stock to meet the higher demand spike while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent volatility; using recent_N reduces overweighting on the old near-zero samples and mitigates stockouts given confirmed 0 lead time and no missing shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (demands ~60,146,102,104,95,79,105,114,79,87; recent mean ~95-100). On-hand=52, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) confirmed by arrivals. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast using the most recent 10 demand observations (captures the new higher-demand regime and recent variability), which helps the OR backend produce a base-stock aligned to current demand while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

On-hand=40, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Observed lead times across concluded history are consistently 0; use calculated lead time reflecting observations. Set L by calculation of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with earlier zero-demand samples. This raises the base-stock to meet current demand while keeping sigma estimate recent to limit unnecessary safety stock given low holding cost (H=$1) and high profit (P=$19).

To cover the short review+lead period and recent high demand, set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast/volatility to the most recent sustained regime (balances service level given high profit $19 vs holding $1). This aims to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost modest.

Historical concludes show consistent 0 actual lead time and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-02-11 (recent weekly demands ~60\u2013146, carry-over already recorded). I keep L at promised/default (0) because arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 7 demand observations) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet current demand while limiting excess holding cost; using recent data tightens mean and volatility estimates to balance service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has declined from earlier spike but remains higher than the very early samples: last 7 demands (P8\u2013P14)=114,79,87,96,60,40,32 -> mean\u224872.57. On-hand=94, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~1.3 weeks. Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use promised (default). To target service while limiting holding cost, set demand forecast using recent 7-week regime (captures downward trend from the spike) and match volatility to the same window so the OR backend computes an appropriate base-stock and cap.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has declined (last 7 concluded demands lower than earlier periods), so I reduce forecast horizon to recent behavior. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to base demand forecast on the most recent 7 observations, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This reduces replenishment to match the recent downward demand trend and limits holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=90, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. Demand has declined sharply since Period 12 (recent demands: P12..P16 = 60,40,32,19,18). I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the new low-demand regime (captures P12..P16). Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect lower recent variability. This keeps inventory conservative to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg(P12..P16)=33.8 (n=5) down from prior avg ~98.7 (Periods 1..11); sustained 5-period decline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined: last 5 demands (P13..P17) = [40,32,19,18,15], mean=24.8 units/week and sample std\u22489.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclude history. To avoid excess holding while preserving service (profit/holding implies very high target service level q=0.95), I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the sustained lower regime and recent_N for volatility (N=5). Using L=default (promised 0) keeps ordering consistent with observed arrivals. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the current lowered demand regime while retaining the backend's high service-level target.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has declined and stabilized at low levels: last 5 demands (P14..P18)=[32,19,18,15,11], mean=19. On-hand=64, in-transit=0, so current stock covers multiple periods at this demand level; no overdue shipments (lead time historically confirmed 0). Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime (reduces unnecessary holding). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent lower volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward a low base-stock, lowering holding cost while preserving service for current demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals matching same-period orders). Demand dropped around Period 12 and has remained lower (Period12..19 demands = [60,40,32,19,18,15,11,26], recent avg \u224830). I choose L=default because concluded history confirms 0-period lead time. To reflect the new lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 8 periods (Period12..19) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility of this sustained regime, balancing service level against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand shows a large single-week spike in Period 20 (156) after several low weeks (Periods 16-19: 18,15,11,26). I use calculate for L to let backend confirm average observed lead time (expected 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16-20) to capture the recent up-tick including the spike: this yields a short-run forecast (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks. For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent surge risk) against holding cost by targeting short-run sample stats rather than long-term averages.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand shows two extreme spikes (Periods 20\u201321: 156, 238) after a lower-demand regime (Periods 12\u201319 avg ~24). Spike is not yet a sustained regime (only 2 periods), so I avoid switching to a full recent-sample mean. I set L to default (promised = 0) consistent with observed lead time. For demand level I use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) to adapt moderately quickly toward the recent uptick without overreacting to two-week noise. For volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture current short-run variability (including the large recent swings). These choices raise the target base-stock somewhat to protect service during the recent spike while constraining holding cost exposure by not fully adopting a high static mean until the spike persists.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=157, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a new high regime starting Period 20 (demands: P20=156, P21=238, P22=129; avg=174.33, n=3) with P23=111 still elevated vs. earlier lower regime (~33.8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (many periods showing arrived same period). To capture the recent high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, set L to the calculated (observed) lead time and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the most recent spike (covers current (L+1) periods). This increases target stock to avoid stockouts during the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N=3 reflects recent variability, letting the backend size safety stock appropriately given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 20 (demands: P20..P24 = 156,238,129,111,198; 5-period avg=166.4) versus the prior low regime (~33.8). On-hand=75, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been reliably observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (covers P20..P24) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 samples. For volatility I use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while sigma_hat raises safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand is volatile with a clear higher-demand regime starting Period 20 (Periods 20-25 recent demands = [156,238,129,111,198,118], mean\u2248158.3). On-hand=134, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient vs recent weekly demand (~158). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 repeatedly, so use promised/default lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 20-25) to capture the current elevated regime and recent volatility; L=default preserves confirmed 0-period lead time. These parameters push the OR base-stock up to meet the higher recent demand while z* (q\u22480.95) keeps service high given profit/holding ratio.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Recent demand since Period 20 shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 20-26 demand = [156,238,129,111,198,118,138], mean\u2248155.4, elevated vs prior). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 (the 7-period regime since Period 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 7 samples; this keeps the base-stock tuned to the new higher mean while capturing elevated volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given current on-hand stock of 104 and zero in-transit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand since Period 20 shows a sustained higher regime (Periods 20\u201327 demand = [156,238,129,111,198,118,138,99], regime length=8). I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (will be 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility, so the OR backend raises the base-stock to service the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 198,118,138,99,96) shows a higher but variable regime; I use a recent_N forecast over last 5 periods to capture current demand level while keeping volatility measured over the same window. Choosing L=default (promised 0) preserves fast replenishment assumption; mu_hat recent_N N=5 uses (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands to reflect the elevated recent average (~129.8/week); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 captures recent demand variability to set safety stock appropriately given high profit/low holding cost tradeoff.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=116, in-transit=0 so current cover \u22481 week at recent demand. Lead time history consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals same period). To align ordering with the most recent regime and avoid overstock from older high spikes, set L to promised (default=0), set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent mean demand, and set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps base-stock tuned to current demand while limiting holding cost given large on-hand.

Recent demand (Periods 20..30, n=11) averaged ~131.5 units/week, a sustained higher regime vs earlier low periods. To target service while limiting holding cost, keep L as default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to reflect the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been elevated and variable since the Period 20 regime shift (spike around Periods 20-25) and the last 7 weeks (Periods 25-31) show a stable elevated mean (~103 units/week) with moderate volatility. On-hand=114, in-transit=0 so we currently have ~1.1 weeks of recent demand coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; use promised/default L=0. To align the OR backend to recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 observed demand periods (Periods 25-31) so the base stock reflects the current elevated mean while sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has moderated from prior spikes; last 7 concluded weekly demands (Periods 26..32) = [138,99,96,83,80,99,59], mean\u224893.4, so I use a recent-N forecast to capture the current regime and avoid overweighting older high-volatility months. Chosen: L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes); mu_hat=recent_N N=7 to set base-stock \u2248 (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent ~93/wk) and holding cost (holding low $1/unit) while accounting for no in-transit cover.

Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 periods; recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime shift since prior insights. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed 0 lead time and long-run demand statistics while avoiding unnecessary model tuning given no new sustained changepoint, I select default methods so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This favors stable service (prevent stockouts) while letting holding cost be handled via the backend's q calculation.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (stable). Recent demand has declined from prior peaks but no new 3+ period regime shift since previous carry-overs. Given confirmed 0 lead time and stable variability, use default calculations so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This lets the backend set a higher service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while keeping holding cost exposure managed by the capped order cap.

I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime (reduces ordering vs older high-demand periods). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to capture current low volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk given high on-hand inventory and low recent demand while preserving service for current demand levels.

Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0; I'll keep L=default to match supplier promise. To avoid excess holding while matching recent lower demand, I set demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock reflects the current low-demand regime and reduces unnecessary orders/holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen vs earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) = [20,29,28,10,8], suggesting a lower recent regime. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scales variability to recent volatility, reacting to the sustained lower-demand regime and reducing overstock risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Lead-time history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time (many concluded arrivals same period), so keep L as promised (default). Demand has entered a sustained low regime since Period 35: recent weekly demand (P35..P41) = [27,20,29,28,10,8,9], avg \u224818.7 (n=7). To reflect this persistent decline and avoid overstock/holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 periods (captures current mean and volatility). These parameters reduce target base-stock and limit new receipts given current on-hand cushion of 83 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 35: avg(P35..P41)=18.7 (n=7), sustained low demand compared with earlier higher regimes.

Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I keep L=default (promised 0) and forecast demand using the most recent low-demand regime: mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture Periods 35..41 behavior. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent low volatility. These choices tell the OR backend to set a lower base-stock aligned with the sustained low-demand regime and avoid unnecessary replenishment given current on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 35 (avg ~18.7 across P35..P41) and the most recent weeks remain low (demands in last 9 periods: P35..P43). On-hand=41, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; no evidence of lost shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). To capture the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most recent 9 samples, which reduces target base-stock and limits overstock/holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I choose L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (most recent 7 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the reduced mean and volatility.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows confirmed same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained low-demand regime since ~Period 35 with one large stockout spike in Period 45. Use promised lead time (default=0). For demand forecast, focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current lower mean/volatility (capture last ~10 periods of demand to estimate). This keeps base stock modest to avoid holding costs while responding to the current low-demand regime; recent_N gives the OR engine a localized mean/variance rather than the long-run high-demand spikes.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently (orders arriving same period). Recent demand shows a prolonged low-demand regime starting Period 35 (carry-over) but there were two high weeks (P45-46) that appear temporary. To be conservative and avoid overstock from short-lived spikes, I base demand forecast on the recent 7-week window (captures the low-demand regime while limiting influence of the 2-week spike). Therefore: L uses default (promised=0); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to reflect current lower demand variability while remaining responsive to recent changes. This keeps base stock moderate to balance service (avoid stockouts on modest demand) vs holding cost (prevent large buildup from short spike).
