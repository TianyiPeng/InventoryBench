No in-transit or overdue orders to evaluate. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so without ordering we will stockout this period. e) Final order logic: aim to meet expected demand for the current week (~26) plus a small safety buffer for variability and potential Valentine uplift while avoiding excessive holding cost ($1/unit/period).
