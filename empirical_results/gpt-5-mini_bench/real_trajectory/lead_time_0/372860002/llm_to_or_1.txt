Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860002 has five weekly historical samples (77,59,67,78,112). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. No sustained changepoint or season signal detected. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates based on all samples so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level from profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 372860002: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean \u224878.6, std \u224820.2; Period 1 demand=142 (one-off spike vs history). Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=0 (matches promise). No sustained demand regime change detected. Use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps safety stock driven by long-run stats while avoiding overreacting to a single high-demand week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand has risen (recent weekly demands: 112, 142, 311) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times = 0 periods (Period1 and Period2). I choose L=default to use promised lead time 0. For demand I detect a recent upward regime so I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the last three weeks (112,142,311) giving a forecast that reflects the spike. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect the higher recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base stock to cover the higher short-term demand while keeping holding cost considered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5495.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent realized demand shows a clear upward regime: Periods 1-3 demands = 142, 311, 293 (avg \u2248 248.7) versus older sample mean \u2248 78.6. On-hand=72, in-transit=0 so pipeline insufficient for elevated demand. Lead time observed consistently 0 in concluded periods, so set L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3). Use sigma_hat based on the same recent window to reflect increased volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime while letting the backend cap limit moderate single-period orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from 78.6 to 248.7 (+217%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $3658.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=199, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted up vs historical baseline (sustained high demands in Periods 1\u20134: 142,311,293,203). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0; I therefore set L to the observed average. To capture the new higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (last 4 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the elevated mean and observed variability while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand samples. This increases service (reduces stockouts) given current on-hand but keeps holding risk moderate given holding cost=$1/unit by using only the recent regime samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3652.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (Period1-5 demands: 142,311,293,203,201) and observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. On-hand=167, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover for upcoming demand. I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand forecasts I use the most recent 5 periods to capture the new high-demand regime (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods under the new regime and the capped order limit accounts for demand variability. This balances higher service-level needs from the sustained uplift while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demand settled at a higher regime after early jump; last 4 observed weekly demands = [293,203,201,239], mean=234. On-hand=107, in-transit=0 \u2192 likely shortage next period if no order. All concluded lead times = 0, so keep L as promised (default). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (gives (1+L)\xd7mean over last 4 = 234). Use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep OR backend responsive to the sustained higher demand while relying on observed zero lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent demands: 293,203,201,239,354). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next period. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use calculated lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and current volatility, use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and std (covers the most recent five periods). These parameters bias ordering toward meeting elevated demand while the OR engine's cap limits excess stock to control holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained high demands since Period 3). All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 consistently. To cover the current period plus lead time and capture the recent higher mean/volatility, I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and std (captures recent 6 periods P3\u2013P8 where demand averaged high) and keep L at default (promised lead time=0). This increases safety stock to balance the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): on-hand=126, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated but no new 3+ period regime shift beyond the previously recorded change. Use promised/default lead time to let OR backend leverage confirmed zero LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service-level (profit=19 vs holding=1) via its internal q formula. This keeps parameters robust to past variability while avoiding overfitting short fluctuations.

Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concludes show every observed arrival had lead_time=0 \u2014 use calculate to confirm actual lead time=0. Demand has been elevated and variable since the early periods (sustained higher regime from P3 onward); to capture the recent higher mean/volatility I use recent_N on the most recent regime (last 7 concluded demand periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand while limiting noise from older low-demand weeks. These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the higher demand (improving service and profit) while sigma_hat controls safety stock to limit holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has been consistently high (Periods 4\u201311 weekly demand mostly 200\u2013472, recent mean well above early-sample mean). Observed lead times in concluded history are all 0, so keep promised/default lead time. Use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (focus on last 8 weeks to reflect recent behavior while keeping sample >=3). This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to set an appropriate safety stock and balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3; use recent data to capture current mean/volatility. Set L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the last 10 demand observations in the high-demand regime) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2 with consistently large weekly sales; last concluded demand samples are mostly high (periods 4\u201313). On-hand=224, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period and no overdue shipments. Actual observed lead times have been 0 in all concluded periods. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm L=0. For demand I target recent data to reflect the new high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 (captures the most recent stable regime). Volatility is set with recent_N, N=10 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep the base stock responsive to the sustained elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=197, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has settled above the Jan baseline \u2014 last 6 concluded demands (P9\u2013P14) = [282,382,472,444,261,288], mean \u2248 354.8. Pipeline is zero, so replenish to cover the next review+lead period using recent demand. I choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while using default L to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to recent realized demand rather than old low-volume samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=154, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments in concluded history. Promised lead time=0 and all observed concluded lead_times = 0, so keep L as default. Demand has been at a sustained higher level since early periods (multiple weeks of 200-480 sales); to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime, use recent_N on the last 12 samples for mean and volatility (captures Periods 4-15 behaviour while smoothing week-to-week noise). This raises base_stock to match recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N accounts for recent variability, balancing service vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=197, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has a higher mean than early-sample regime; I use recent_N (last 5 weeks: Periods 13-17 demands = 261,288,350,379,268) to capture the most relevant demand level for the (1+L) review+lead period. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to support high service (profit $19 vs holding $1 => high q\u22480.95) while avoiding excess inventory accumulation given current on-hand of 197 and zero pipeline.

Demand history exhibits variability but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 shift. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will be 0). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this leverages full historical data given no new sustained change.

I use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals and default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full historical sample, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost given current low on-hand and no pipeline.

Recent demand has been elevated vs early samples; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime (last 5 demands: P16-P20 = 379,268,286,458,405; mean\u2248359.2) so the OR backend sizes base stock to current demand levels while limiting carry.

Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (stored in carry-over previously). To let the OR engine use full-sample estimates and because lead time has been stable, I select default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014balancing service level with holding cost given current on-hand stock.

To capture the current high recent demand I use a recent_N mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to weight latest regime; sigma_hat kept default to reflect overall historical variability.

Recent demand samples (through Period 23) are elevated vs early periods but a prior carry-over insight already recorded that regime shift; no new sustained changepoint detected. Given confirmed 0-period lead time and stable historical sample set, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by letting the backend set the service-targeted base stock while avoiding manual over-adjustment for short-term noise.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=192, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders in each concluded period arrived same period). Recent demand has varied but no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded Period 4 shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples). This avoids overfitting to short-term noise and lets the capped ordering cap limit excessive replenishment given current on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201325) show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period), so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand history shows stable weekly demand (no new sustained changepoint since prior insight). To keep backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, I select default methods: L uses promised lead time (0), mu_hat uses full-sample mean scaled by (1+L), and sigma_hat uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (uses all observed demand data) and holding cost (no explicit inflation of safety stock).

Recent demand has been stable after the earlier sustained regime shift recorded in carry-over; no new sustained changepoint detected. Using defaults lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Current on-hand=250, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period (promised L=0) arrivals and demand mostly in 200-480 range. No evidence of lost/delayed shipments; pipeline is empty so we must rely on base-stock to replenish. Use default lead time (promised L=0) because all concluded lead_time observations = 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full demand history, which balances service level (via q derived from profit vs holding cost) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=259, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead time = 0 consistently (orders arriving same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows stable weekly demand in recent months (no new sustained changepoint since prior insight). Profit/holding imply a high service target (q\u22480.95) so keep backend's default demand estimates to let OR engine compute base stock and cap using full-sample mean/variance. Using defaults avoids overfitting short fluctuations while respecting the high profit-driven service level.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Given stable regime and high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), use promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock to preserve service while accounting for variability. Defaults let backend apply cap and service-level tradeoff automatically.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=270, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all arrivals same-period), so use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Recent demand (Periods 1-30) shows mean demand elevated vs earliest samples but no new sustained changepoint since prior carry-over; current on-hand (~270) already covers several weeks of average demand, reducing need for aggressive replenishment. I select default L so backend uses promised lead time=0; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, balancing service level with holding cost given high on-hand inventory and low holding cost ($1/unit). This avoids over-ordering while preserving service.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=287, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). Demand has declined from mid-year peaks to recent weekly demands ~168\u2013189 (Periods 29-31). Use calculate for L to let backend confirm observed lead time (expected \u22480). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving long-run demand signal while accounting for the chosen L. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical mean/variance and avoids overreacting to recent low variance while on-hand inventory (287) already covers near-term demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=316, in-transit=0, recent concludes show consistent zero lead time historically (all concluded arrivals report lead_time=0). No new sustained demand/lead-time change detected beyond the previously recorded regime shift. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend trusts on-hand immediately available. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)/sqrt(1+L)) so the backend's base-stock calculation leverages full history and the known earlier regime change rather than overfitting to short recent dips. This balances service (high profit per unit) against low holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from long-run stats while honoring current visible inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). All concluded lead times so far = 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has declined from mid-year peaks to lower values in the last ~20 weeks; on-hand=215, in-transit=0 so we should forecast using recent demand to avoid excess holding. I choose recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the base-stock and cap on the most recent regime (reduces overweighting of earlier high peaks). This balances service (captures recent demand variability) versus holding costs given high profit/low holding ratio.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). On-hand=205, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down from mid-year peaks; last 8 demands (Periods 27-34) = [221,208,199,189,168,136,234,217], mean \u2248195. I keep L as default since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 so the (1+L)\xd7mean uses the latest regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to match volatility to the same window. This raises service targeting on current demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost $1/unit. Parameters chosen balance high profit-driven service level (q\u22480.95) with recent demand evidence and current on-hand=205.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; no missing shipments. Demand has trended down from summer peaks into autumn; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current lower regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed = 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L) demand and volatility on the last ~8 weeks, which captures the recent lower-demand regime and reduces overstock risk while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2098.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=125, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Period 4 change. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed reliable same-period arrivals and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This balances service (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand and zero pipeline, avoiding overreaction to recent week-to-week noise.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=288, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments observed; historical concluded lead times all 0. Recent weeks show a sustained downward demand regime versus earlier high-sell periods, so I reduce forecast responsiveness by using a recent-sample estimate. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 weeks, lowering target base-stock and reducing holding cost while keeping service for current lower demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=157, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals pending and no overdue shipments. Recent weeks (Periods 31-38) show a sustained lower demand regime versus the earlier high-volume months. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0 with no evidence of change. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 31-38) to capture the sustained drop (mean \u2248165.3) so the backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices balance service level (by sizing to recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 31-38: avg demand \u2248165.3 over 8 periods (sustained lower-demand regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1486.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has shifted to a lower regime (Periods 31-38 avg \u2248165.3; last 6 observed demands: 117,150,313,162,44,169 then 131,86 show variability but trending lower). On-hand=148, in-transit=0 so we have ~1\u20132 weeks cover; no overdue shipments. Use default lead time (promised 0) since all concluded lead_time observations show 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=8) to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime (Periods 31\u201338) and reduce ordering to avoid excess holding cost. Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock lower to balance service vs holding cost given high profit ($19) but low holding cost ($1).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime (Periods 33-40 mean \u2248150 units/week). On-hand=143, in-transit=0 \u2014 roughly one week of expected demand. Promised lead time historically observed = 0. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 33-40). Sigma set to recent_N N=8 to reflect volatility in that same recent window. These choices keep the base-stock near current realized demand (reducing excess holding) while allowing the OR backend cap to limit order size given lead-time=0 and observed lower mean.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Observed concluded lead times all 0; no evidence of delays. Recent demand has shifted down versus earlier peaks: last 7 concluded demands (P35-P41) = [169,117,150,131,86,95,88], average \u2248119.4, lower than the previously recorded lower-demand regime (~165). To reflect the recent sustained lower demand while keeping lead time as promised, I set L=default and use a recent_N=7 estimate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing orders and holding cost while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 31-42) shows a sustained lower-demand regime (avg \u2248165/week across P31-38 and continued lower values through P42). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (arrivals observed each period, lead_time historically 0). To reflect the recently lower demand regime I use recent_N over the last 12 weeks (the regime length from P31\u2013P42 = 12) while keeping promised lead time. This keeps the OR base-stock tuned to current lower demand and reduces excess holding cost risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Current on-hand=159, in-transit=0; recent demand (Periods 39-43) = [86,95,88,182,69], mean\u2248104 over last 5 weeks indicating a lower-demand regime vs earlier high volumes. No recent arrivals outstanding. I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence to extend; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility. This reduces the base-stock target so orders won't overstock the current 159 on-hand, balancing profit vs $1 holding cost while preserving service for expected ~104/week demand.

Recent demand since Period 39 (Periods 39-44) shows a lower-demand regime (6 periods, recent demands = [86,95,88,182,69,81]; mean \u2248100). Use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflecting the current lower regime and avoids overstocking given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; no lost shipments observed. Recent demand has downshifted vs earlier year: last 8 concluded demands (P38-P45) = [131,86,95,88,182,69,81,116], average \u2248106, indicating a lower-demand regime versus mid-year. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime over the most recent 8 periods, and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with the current demand level and avoids excess holding cost ahead of year-end seasonality uncertainty.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected (last concluded arrivals were for Period 46). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods so use default promised L. Recent demand (Periods 39-46) shows a sustained lower-demand regime (8 periods) with mean \u2248105.75 units/week vs earlier regime \u2248165.3. To align the OR base-stock to recent demand and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent regime). L=default ensures backend uses promised lead time (0). These parameters reduce overstating demand and lower inventory while maintaining service for the recent lower-demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 39-46: avg decreased to 105.75 (Periods 39-46) from prior ~165.3 (Periods 31-38), a ~-36% drop, sustained for 8 periods.
