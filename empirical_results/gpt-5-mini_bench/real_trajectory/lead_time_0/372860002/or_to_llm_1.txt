OR recommends 420 based on historical mean and promised L=0; OR likely ignores recent sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 36\u201345 average ~109) and recent variability. Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods (many arrivals same-period), so orders should arrive this period; risk of lost shipments appears low. Calendar: Period 46 = 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) can cause a modest short-term uplift (observed spike in Period 42 but not sustained). Profit/holding implies high service (critical fractile ~0.95) but ordering 420 would create large holding cost given recent ~100-demand regime. Balancing Xmas upside vs recent mean and holding cost, I place a conservative uplift over recent mean: target \u2248 1.6\xd7recent mean (~110) \u2192 ~176, round to 180 to provide buffer for holiday demand while limiting holding cost. Order will arrive same period (L=0 observed).",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 0 in concluded periods (orders consistently arrived same period). Current on-hand = 51, in-transit = 0. Recent sustained demand regime (Periods 36\u201341 and onward) is lower: single-period average \u2248111 units with moderate variability; last three demands = 81,116,129 (still around ~110). OR recommends 367 based on historical/long-run estimates and the high critical fractile (q=19/20=0.95) which inflates safety stock. With lead_time=0 we need to cover roughly one period of demand (L+1 => 1); target stock = mean + z*\xb7\u03c3. Using the recent mean (~111) and a conservative safety buffer (z*\u22481.645 \u2192 add ~60\u201370 units of safety given observed variability) gives a target on-hand \u2248170\u2013180 units. With 51 on-hand, order \u2248120\u2013130 units. This reduces excessive holding cost risk from OR's 367 while still covering expected demand and a reasonable safety margin given confirmed low-demand regime and zero lead time.",
