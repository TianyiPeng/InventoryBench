Product is a women's belt (accessory) which is likely to see elevated demand around gift-giving occasions. b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (0,0,37,61,109) \u2014 recent weeks average ~69 and last observed week was 109, indicating accelerating interest. c) Lead time / orders: Promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown; no in-transit and no concluded arrivals to infer. Conservatively assume at least 1-period arrival risk, so we must cover current period demand without relying on immediate arrivals. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so only new order can meet upcoming demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, so overstocks are costly but lost sales also forfeit profitable margin. e) Final order logic: Aim to cover elevated demand for this period (anticipate demand between the recent 109 and an uplift for Valentine), plus a small safety buffer given uncertain lead time.
