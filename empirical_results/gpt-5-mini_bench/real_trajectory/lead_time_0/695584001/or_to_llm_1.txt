Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (Periods 1\u201346) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period), so supplier is reliable with L=0. Inventory/demand analysis: on-hand = 51, in-transit = 0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 43\u201346) = {17, 10, 32, 17}, mean \u2248 19.5; the recent post-spike regime has cooled and current demand \u224820 units/week. With L=0 we must cover (L+1)=1 upcoming period of demand; on-hand 51 already comfortably covers ~20 units. Cost tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 means moderate service preference, but ordering creates holding cost immediately; unnecessary ordering reduces R_t. OR recommended 34 units based on longer-history stats and promised L; given confirmed L=0 and ample on-hand, ordering would create excess holding cost without improving sales. Final strategy: order 0 units this period to avoid extra holding cost while satisfying expected demand from on-hand stock. Monitor next periods for any sustained demand uptick before ordering.",
