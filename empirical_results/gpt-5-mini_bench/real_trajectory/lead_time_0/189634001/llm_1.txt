Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer delays. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) and profit is high ($19/unit), so overstock is less costly relative to lost sales. To cover current-period demand (demand occurs after decision) plus some safety given lead-time uncertainty, order approximately the historical weekly peak (60) to target ~1 week of supply and avoid stockout while we observe actual arrivals next period. Monitor arrivals next period to infer lead time and adjust future orders.",

Period 1 demand evidence: demand=201 but only 60 sold due to stockout, so true realized demand that week = 201 (large spike vs. historical average). This is only one period of elevated demand \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Lead time inference: confirmed actual lead_time = 0 (P1 order arrived in P1). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: with lead_time=0 the order will arrive during Period 2 and can meet Period 2 demand; to avoid a repeat stockout we should replenish up to expected near-term demand. Given observed true demand=201 (strong signal) and high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1/period), ordering enough to cover the observed demand minimizes lost-sales penalty and maximizes expected reward.
