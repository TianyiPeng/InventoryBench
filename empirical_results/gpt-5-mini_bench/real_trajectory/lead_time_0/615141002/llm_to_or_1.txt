Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand (5 samples from Jan 2019) shows mean \u2248114.6 units/week and std \u224826.1. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time is unobserved. Use promised lead time (default) and population-based forecasts to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/std. This keeps forecast conservative given no evidence of a regime shift or shipment delays.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-02-18: recent weekly demand samples (99,85,106,148,135) give mean \u2248114.6. Period1 showed an on-time arrival with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived P1). On-hand=58, in-transit=0; single low demand observation (79 sold) is not yet a sustained regime change. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics so the OR backend sets base-stock from the long-run mean while avoiding overreacting to a single low week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two consecutive same-period arrivals: orders placed in P1 and P2 both arrived with lead_time=0, so no evidence of lead-time drift. Demand history available (five weekly samples from Jan 2019) will be used as the baseline. Current inventory: on-hand=48, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I select default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(samples) and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (profit/holding cost ratio) using full-sample statistics while avoiding premature adjustments given no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-3) shows on-hand 57, no in-transit, and three consecutive arrivals with lead_time=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~114.6 units. Promised lead time is 0 and recent evidence supports it, so use L=default. No strong demand regime shift detected (only 5 historical samples, stable weekly pattern), so use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap. This balances service (use observed mean) against holding cost by relying on standard base-stock formula rather than inflating forecast.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 arrived P2; P3 arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a single extreme demand spike in Period 4 (509) after three stable weeks (~71-84). This appears to be an isolated outlier (not yet 3+ periods of sustained shift), and lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. To avoid overreacting to a one-period spike, I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost without overweighting the outlier. No new sustained pattern is recorded.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows two very large demands in Periods 4\u20135 (509, 595) following three low/typical weeks (79,84,71). This is an apparent but not yet sustained regime shift (only 2 high-demand periods), so I remain conservative. Lead time observed historically is 0 (consistent with concluded messages), so use observed-average. For demand I use the backend default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) to avoid overreacting to a 2-period spike; sigma uses default whole-sample volatility. No in-transit or on-hand inventory to reconcile; defaults keep orders sized by backend safety-stock logic while limiting overstock risk given holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand shows a clear, sustained regime shift beginning Period 4: pre-shift weekly demand ~70\u2013106 (Periods 1\u20133) then large surge 509,595,274 (Periods 4\u20136). On-hand=80, in-transit=0; lead times have repeatedly concluded as 0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 4\u20136) so the backend scales base-stock to the elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect higher volatility in the new regime. This increases service-level targeting for the current spike while avoiding dilution by low pre-shift data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike in Periods 4-6 then a drop; on-hand=514, in-transit=0 so availability is high now. Promised lead time=0 and recent concluded arrivals confirm same-period arrivals historically. I use L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime (Period 3-7 demands: 71,509,595,274,86) so mu_hat reflects the recent elevated mean while sigma_hat uses the same recent sample set to capture current volatility. These parameters balance service (cover recent spikes) against holding cost given high on-hand stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized demand is highly volatile with two extreme spikes in Periods 4-5 (509,595) followed by lower demand; confirmed lead time = 0 from past concluded periods. To balance service and holding cost I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the post-spike regime while keeping lead time = promised. Selected L=default to keep lead time 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 4-8 demands = 509,595,274,86,112) to reflect current mean and volatility and let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap accordingly.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=428, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 1\u20139 arrivals matched same-period orders). Recent history shows two large demand spikes (P4=509, P5=595) but they are not a sustained regime (fewer than 3 consecutive periods), so I will not change demand estimates. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of the provided samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps ordering conservative given current high on-hand and avoids overstock from transient spikes.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand shows a short-lived extreme spike in Periods 4\u20135 (509,595) followed by return toward lower levels (Periods 6\u201310: 274,86,112,81,47). On-hand=381, in-transit=0 \u2014 substantial inventory already. Lead time historically confirmed as 0; I keep promised lead time to avoid introducing artificial delay. To avoid over-ordering after the spike, I base demand forecast on the recent post-spike regime: use the last 5 periods (Periods 6\u201310) which show mean demand ~120 units. Thus set L=default (promised), mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the lowered regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters temper orders after the short spike while maintaining service given high q (0.8) and current inventory level.

Lead time was previously confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding costs given high on-hand, use default lead-time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance rather than up-weighting recent spikes. This keeps orders minimal unless the backend's calculation indicates restock is needed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=303, in-transit=0. Recent five-week demand shows much lower demand than early-March spike (Period 8-12 demands = 112,81,47,30,48; mean=63.6). Carry-over confirms lead time = 0. No outstanding arrivals or overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since multiple concluded arrivals confirmed same-period delivery. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new, sustained lower-demand regime after the March spike; this keeps target base-stock proportional to current demand (1+L)*mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture current reduced volatility. These choices reduce excess stocking vs. using the earlier high-demand periods while preserving service given confirmed zero lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=268, in-transit=0; recent demand has stepped down from heavy early spikes (Periods 4-6) to a low, stable run in the last 5 periods (P9-P13 demands = 81,47,30,48,35; recent mean\u224848.2). No outstanding arrivals; carry-over confirms lead time = 0 historically. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower regime (changepoint: sustained drop after Period 7 with 5 consecutive lower-demand weeks), so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced volatility in the same window. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=225, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (seed) mean=114.6; recent realized demand (Periods 8-14) has been much lower (~50\u2013110, mostly ~30\u2013112) indicating no sustained regime shift. Carry-over previously confirmed lead time = 0. Use default lead time to reflect promised 0 and confirmed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (conservative given no sustained demand change). This keeps base-stock driven by long-run seed data while avoiding overfitting to short recent lull and balances service vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=219, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows frequent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in Period 4 and multiple subsequent periods). Historical weekly demand samples (seed) mean=114.6. Profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 target service quantile high (q=0.8). Using default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) keeps the OR backend anchored to the full-sample demand mean while preserving the high service level; default volatility used to let backend compute safety stock from historical variance. This is conservative given recent low-but-variable weeks and avoids overreacting to short noisy spells.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-03 (P17): on-hand=229, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; demand spiked in March (P4-6) then settled to a lower regime from P8 onward. I set L by calculate to confirm zero lead time from observed concludes. For demand I target the recent lower regime (Periods 12-16 demands = 48,35,43,53,36 => mean ~43) so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current lower mean and volatility and keep inventory lean vs holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent realized lead times (concludes) consistently show 0 periods; on-hand=202, in-transit=0, recent weekly demand has been low (periods 11-17 demands: 30,48,35,43,53,36,27) compared with earlier spikes. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available samples\u2014this balances service-level targeting against holding cost given inventory is already healthy and holding cost is high relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=225, in-transit=0. Historical early-year demand was high (Mar spike) but demand since mid-April has settled much lower. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 14-18) averages ~37 units/week, indicating a new lower-demand regime; no evidence of lead-time changes (confirmed L=0 earlier). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the recent lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over confirmed). On-hand=192, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low (~30-50/week) since the large early-March spike; no sustained uptick. To keep service high with minimal holding cost and because actual lead time = promised 0, use default lead time and demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history. This balances service vs holding given moderate profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Prior confirmed lead time=0. To avoid excess holdings while maintaining service, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L).

Demand history shows a large one-time spike in March but since then weekly demand has settled to much lower levels (~20-50). I will use the default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters grounded in long-run data while the backend's capped order prevents excessive ordering given inventory on hand.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent weekly demand has been low (~20\u201350 units) after earlier spring spike; on-hand=196, in-transit=0, so current inventory covers several weeks. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0; no evidence of lost shipments. To keep service while avoiding holding cost, use the backend defaults (promised lead time and full-sample demand stats) so OR engine computes base_stock from full history and caps orders. This leverages confirmed L=0 and lets the OR engine balance profit vs. holding cost.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 in multiple concluded periods) and steady weekly demand since March with current on-hand=199, in-transit=0. I therefore set L to the calculated/observed lead time (average of concluded lead times = 0). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock computed from the long-run sample mean/std; this balances service (profitable units) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

I set L=default to keep promised 0 (observations support same-period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 7\u201324) to capture the post-spike steady regime (mean \u224843/week) rather than the higher Jan baseline; this yields mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk from the March spikes while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand pre-Period7 (Jan samples) \u2248114 vs post-Period7 avg \u224843 (\u221262%), sustained for 18 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=158, in-transit=0 \u2192 inventory covers ~3.8 weeks at recent demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201324). Demand regime dropped at Period 7 and has remained low (post-Period7 avg \u224843) for 18 periods; use that recent regime for forecasts. Choose L=default to trust promised/observed 0-day lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering; this aligns with profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (critical fractile ~0.8) so the OR backend will target a higher service level but our lower mu reduces excess holding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Current on-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1-P4 confirms) and no overdue shipments. Demand regime shift at Period 7 is confirmed (pre-P7 mean \u2248114, post-P7 mean \u224843) and has persisted for ~20 periods; recent demand is much lower than the Jan samples. I set L="default" to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This reduces target base-stock compared to using all-sample averages, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand level.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift after Period 7 (post-Period7 avg \u224843, sustained ~18+ periods). On-hand=70, in-transit=0; pipeline sufficient short-term but we should size orders to match the lower post-Period7 demand. Set L to default (promised 0) consistent with observed arrivals. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint regime; regime length since Period7 \u224821 \u2192 capped N=20. This yields (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed over the most recent 20 samples, biasing the base-stock toward the lower, sustained demand and reducing excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows the sustained low-demand regime since Period 7 (post-Jan): weekly demand ~43. On-hand=44, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline and enough to cover ~1 week at current demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (concluded arrivals every period). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (regime length >20); this yields (1+L)*mean over the most recent 20 samples and reduces influence of earlier high-demand spikes. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward lower base-stock appropriate for the new regime, lowering holding costs while maintaining service given the confirmed short lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 7. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time=0. To focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime, I use recent_N (last 10 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility so (1+L) scaling captures short lead time and recent demand behavior; this reduces overstock risk while supporting high service level given profit/holding (q=0.8).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To target service while limiting holding cost, keep L as default (promised = 0) and forecast using recent post-changepoint data: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower, stable demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 7: pre-Period7 avg \u2248114 vs post-Period7 avg \u224843 (\u221262%), persisting 18+ periods. Given confirmed lead time=0, I keep L as default (promised). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime data. Regime length since Period 7 is large (>20), so I set N=20 (per rules N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This yields mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 demand samples (scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L) respectively). These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the lower post-Period7 demand while keeping service level responsive due to z* derived from profit/holding.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=18) for mean and std; keep L=default (promised 0, validated by concluded arrivals). These parameters let the OR engine size (1+L) demand forecast and safety stock around the confirmed lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 4 and repeatedly thereafter). Demand regime shifted down after Period 7 (noted earlier) but recent weeks (Periods 29-33) show a renewed uptick and high volatility (demands: 45,50,76,75,186). To balance service vs holding cost I target the recent short-term demand pattern: set L=default (promised 0), forecast mu_hat using the last N=5 weeks to capture the recent spike, and set sigma_hat from the same recent 5-week window to reflect elevated volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet current high demand while sigma_hat-driven safety stock controls overordering under the capped policy.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift downward after Period 7 (established earlier). Recent demand (Sep weeks) shows elevated variability and several large draws (weeks with 75,76,186,108), so I bias the forecast to recent behavior to capture current mean and volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0. Set L to default (use promised/confirmed 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (capture recent uptick/volatility). N=8 balances enough history to smooth one-off spikes while responding to recent increased demand and variance. This helps the OR backend produce a base-stock that protects service during current higher-variance weeks without long-term overstock given holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand regime shift recorded at Period 7 (large drop from ~114 to ~43) and has persisted; more recently (Periods 29\u201335) demand rose with several stockouts and high weekly sales (50\u2013186). To balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and avoid stockouts given recent volatility, I use recent demand to set forecast and volatility. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent eight concluded demand observations (captures Sept\u2013Oct surge while smoothing noise). This raises the base-stock to cover near-term increased demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for variability, helping the OR backend trade service level versus holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed 0 periods (Periods 1-36 arrivals matched same-period orders). A sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period 7 (post-Period7 lower mean sustained many periods). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, I base demand estimates on recent history rather than all-sample mean. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (caps N at 20 per rules) so the OR backend's base_stock and cap reflect current lower mean and recent volatility, reducing overstock while protecting service level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand increased beginning Period 30 and has remained elevated for 8 periods (Periods 30\u201337). To capture the recent higher demand regime while using confirmed lead time=0, I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 8 demand samples (Periods 30\u201337), balancing higher service needs against holding cost given zero lead time and current zero inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand pre-Period30 \u224843 vs Period30\u201337 avg \u224895 (+121%), sustained for 8 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in the higher regime that began at Period 30 (Period30\u201338 avg \u224895, sustained 9 periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised = 0). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 9 demand samples, Period31\u201339 window intent) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. This emphasizes service for the sustained demand increase while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. No evidence of missing shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime (Periods 30\u201337) showed a sustained uplift; last 8 demand samples (Periods 32\u201339) remain elevated. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 observations; this biases base-stock toward current higher demand while keeping safety stock aligned with recent variability. This balances service (profit per unit $4) against holding cost ($1) given the uptick.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand regime since Period 30 has been higher (Period30\u201337 avg \u224895) and recent weekly demand (Periods 34\u201340: 108,71,90,105,119,60,61) remains elevated vs earlier low-regime. On-hand=75, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this decision. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm actual L=0 (stable). I select L=default to use promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing short spikes. Sigma kept default to reflect overall historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while controlling holding costs by using a recent-sample mean rather than all-time mean.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 30 (Period30\u201341 mean \u224888.9 units/week). On-hand=129, in-transit=0 \u2014 sufficient for ~1\u20132 weeks of current demand but no pipeline cover. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Period30\u201341) to capture the confirmed post-Period30 regime; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those 12 \u224888.9. Volatility is higher due to a large spike (P33=186); I set sigma_hat recent_N N=12 (std \u224837.3). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the elevated post-Period30 demand while keeping holding costs in check given current ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many periods), and recent demand shows an uptick since Period 30 with a large spike in Period 42 (231) consistent with late-Nov holiday surge. To protect service during the holiday surge while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-window demand forecast that captures the higher recent mean and volatility. L set to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 (captures Period35\u201342 demand regime including the holiday spike) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using recent elevated mean and variance.

Recent demand has been elevated since Period 30 with intermittent holiday spike at Period 42; to capture the current higher-demand regime and holiday tail, I use a recent window. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures Periods 36\u201343 demand pattern) so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate for the recent elevated variance and demand, balancing service vs holding cost during the holiday period.

I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the most recent 7-week demand regime (Periods 38\u201344) including the holiday spike, providing a short-window forecast that responds to recent volatility. Sigma uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding overcommitment given zero in-transit and holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. Demand has two recent regime shifts (noted in carry-over): large jump starting Period 30 sustained through late periods. To capture the recent higher-volatility/higher-mean regime I use recent_N=10 (last 10 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat \u2014 N=10 balances responsiveness to the post-Period-30 uplift while retaining some smoothing. L uses default (promised lead time=0). These settings raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) period demand in the current higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to limit stockouts; this balances profit per unit vs $1 holding cost given observed variability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=106, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (P1\u2013P46 arrivals matched orders), so keep promised lead time. Demand has a confirmed higher regime starting Period 30 (Period30\u201337 avg \u224895) and that elevated regime largely persists through recent weeks with higher variance (including a single large promo spike P42=231). I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=17 (Period 30\u201346) to capture the post-Period-30 high-demand regime while down-weighting older low-demand data; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained demand increase and the cap calculation aware of recent volatility.
