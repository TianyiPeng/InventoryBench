Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 399061008 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Only five weekly historical samples (9,6,16,8,14) from Jan\u2013Feb 2019; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Promised lead time is used. I choose L=default so backend uses promised lead time (0). Demand moments set to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable baseline given limited data. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost conservatively while we gather arrival/lead-time evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (observed lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. No clear demand regime shift in the five historical weekly samples (mean ~10.6). Use promised/default lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned; use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap consistently given L=0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Observed arrivals show actual lead times = 0 (P1 and P2 concluded with lead_time 0). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand has stepped up in the last two periods (sold 18->29 with demand 30->55) versus earlier historical weekly samples (9,6,16,8,14). Because the uptick is recent but not yet a sustained 3+ period regime, set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed 0). Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to downweight older low samples while giving moderate weight to the recent higher demand, and keep sigma_hat at default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from only two high observations. This balances service level for the recent demand increase while limiting excess inventory given holding cost and no evidence of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1113.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has jumped sharply: Period1-3 demands = 30, 55, 59 vs historical sample mean 10.6. On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0; no overdue arrivals. Observed concluded lead times for past arrivals are all 0 (Periods 1-3), so use calculated lead time. I detect a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 1 (3 periods of higher demand); to capture the new level and volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3). This increases forecasted base-stock to meet elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent data balances service level vs holding cost given higher demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): recent avg = 48.0 (Periods 1-3) vs prior sample avg = 10.6 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), increase \u2248 +352%; sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $786.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand regime (Periods 1-4) shows elevated demand: recent 4-period mean = 46.75 (30,55,59,43) vs historical pre-regime mean \u224810.6. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1-4 are 0 \u2192 use calculate to let backend confirm L=0. To capture the confirmed demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (covers the full new regime). Volatility has clearly shifted with the regime, so set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 as well. These settings bias orders toward the higher recent demand while respecting low holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19), letting the backend compute service-level z and cap.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has shifted upward starting Period 1 (periods 1-5 demands: 30,55,59,43,42). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use promised lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods (regime length=5). This yields mu_hat based on recent_N (N=5) and matching sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) keeps service levels prioritized.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime vs earlier samples (demands P1-6 = 30,55,59,43,42,70; recent avg=49.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover ongoing elevated demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders placed arrived same period). I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the last 6 concluded demand observations). This increases target base-stock to improve service while holding cost is low relative to profit ($19 vs $1), so bias toward higher service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (periods 1-6 average \u224849.8) with one extreme spike in Period 7 (272) that appears episodic. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set L to "calculate" to confirm the observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand periods, P2\u2013P7) to capture the sustained higher demand regime while diluting the single extreme spike; mu_hat uses recent_N N=6 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of those 6 samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to meet the new higher demand regime while keeping holding costs controlled by using a recent-sample volatility estimate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so use default promised L. Recent demand shows a new high regime in Periods 6-8 (70,272,253); to capture current demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=3 (most recent 3 periods). These parameters target service during the elevated demand while the backend caps orders; using recent data limits understock risk given zero pipeline and low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased to 198.33 (Periods 6-8) vs prior recent avg 48.0 (Periods 1-3), increase \u2248 +313%; sustained for 3 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15. On-hand=219, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P9 arrived same period). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: last 4 concluded demands (P6\u2013P9 = 70,272,253,163) avg \u2248 189.5, so I rely on the most recent 4 periods to forecast. I set L via calculate (observed lead time=0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean \u2248 189.5). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the sustained demand increase while avoiding overstock given current high on-hand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=174, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 consistently. Demand has shifted up markedly since Period 6; recent 5-period mean (P6-P10) = 185.4 units/week. To prioritize service during this sustained high-demand regime while controlling holding cost, set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean with L=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters aim to keep base stock aligned with recent demand spikes and avoid stockouts while not inflating safety stock from older low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1-P10 orders all arrived with lead_time=0).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=151, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed arrivals with lead_time=0; no overdue or lost shipments. Demand has experienced sustained upward regime since Period 6; I therefore set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 (regime from Period 6\u201311) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher-demand regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 (recent demands: 169,168,227). To meet high demand while limiting holding cost, set lead time to promised (default) and forecast using the most recent 3 weeks to capture the current regime: mu_hat recent_N N=3, sigma_hat recent_N N=3. This biases orders toward covering the elevated recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to observed volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (all observed arrivals show lead_time=0), so use calculated L to reflect observed data. Recent demand regime is the higher-volatility, high-mean regime: last 6 demands (Periods 8-13) = {253,163,169,168,227,141}, sustained for 6 periods; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders P1\u2013P14 arrived with W=0) so use calculated lead time. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated weekly demand); to capture the current demand level and recent variability I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 concluded demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand observations. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by sizing base stock to recent demand and observed volatility. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 6 (sustained high weekly sales ~140\u2013272). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been observed consistently as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (last 5 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service for the recent elevated demand while limiting excess inventory; recent_N=5 balances responsiveness and noise given 5 consecutive recent samples. This keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and holding cost tradeoff (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 6 (many weeks of 150\u2013270 demand). On-hand=36, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and prior conclues confirm actual lead time=0. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 (latest 5 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock is sized to recent demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same window. L set to default (promised=0) since arrivals have consistently concluded with lead_time=0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-10. On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P17) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0, so use observed-average lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6; to capture recent elevated demand I use recent_N on the most recent stable window (Periods 11\u201317, 7 samples) for both mu and sigma. This balances service (capture current high mean) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the long-run low-demand sample.

On-hand=79, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concluded messages show actual lead time=0 (stable). To target service while limiting holding cost I use recent demand to set forecast: use recent_N over last 5 weeks to capture current regime without overreacting to a single spike. Sigma set to recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. L kept default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time.

To maintain service while avoiding extra holding, use promised lead time (L=0) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history (default methods).

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0; recent demand has been elevated versus the initial January samples but no new sustained changepoint detected since prior carry-over insights. To let the OR backend compute base-stock using full-sample stats (and because on-hand inventory is already healthy), use default lead time and default demand moments so the engine balances service level vs holding cost without aggressive manual overrides.

Recent demand (Periods 6\u201323) has been in a higher sustained regime vs the very early samples. To capture the current elevated demand regime and reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind, set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the last 18 demand periods (Periods 6\u201323) where the high-demand regime is stable (regime length \u224818 periods). This focuses replenishment on the current demand level and observed variability, balancing service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=182, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has trended lower vs earlier spring peak; last 5 concluded demands (P20-P24) = [138,127,104,111,73], recent avg \u2248110.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 historically. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets stocking reflecting the recent, lower-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and multiple sustained demand regime shifts to materially higher weekly demand; recent weekly demand has been elevated and more variable versus the initial five-sample history. I keep L at the promised/default (0) because lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine computes base_stock from recent realized demand (weights recent high-volume periods). I select N=20 to cover the most recent, sustained regime while smoothing short blips. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent demand) while sigma_hat from recent data controls buffer size to limit excess holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=186, in-transit=0, recent weekly demand has moderated (~67\u2013111 over last 5 weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0 LT; for demand I use recent_5 to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=5 covers the most recent 5 weeks: demands 104,111,73,78,67) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std from the same recent 5 samples. This keeps provisioning aligned to recent demand and avoids excess holding given Holding=$1/unit while preserving service via recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across all observed orders, so use observed lead time estimate. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime for many periods (large, persistent demand since Period 6); to reflect the current regime I use recent data window to forecast across the (1+L) review+lead horizon and to capture current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward (high service level given profit/holding) while using recent samples to avoid under-forecasting the elevated demand seen since early March.

Inventory is healthy vs recent weekly demand (\u224865\u201385). I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging full historical demand given no new sustained regime shift and ample on-hand stock to avoid over-ordering.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast on the most recent stable regime and avoid inflation from earlier high-demand spikes; this keeps base_stock responsive to current demand and limits holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

Current on-hand=137, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand but no pipeline. Set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (confirmed 0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=187, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 30-34) averages ~42 units/week; demand has settled to this lower regime after summer spikes. To keep service high (q\u22480.95 given Profit=$19, Holding=$1) while avoiding excessive holding, set L=default (promised=0) and forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current regime. Therefore mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) so base_stock = (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current variability. With on-hand=187 and no pipeline, the OR engine will likely order little or none this period, avoiding extra holding cost while maintaining high fill rate.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=189, in-transit=0; historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0. Demand has been modest recently (last 8 demands avg \u224837.75 units). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts from the most recent 8 periods to reflect the current lower-demand regime. mu_hat recent_N N=8 yields (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 captures recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=166, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (orders always arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been low/stable (last 5 concluded demands: 50, 38, 18, 32, 23; recent mean \u2248 32.2). To keep inventory from growing while maintaining service, set lead time to default (0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base stock around the recent demand level and captures recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-11-04. On-hand=153, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened over the last 6 weeks (periods 33-38), so I use a recent window to set demand forecast and volatility to reflect the lower regime; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history so use default promised lead time. This keeps orders conservative (reduces excess inventory) while maintaining service given current high on-hand stock.

Recent weekly demand has dropped and stabilized over the last 5 periods (Periods 35-39: demands = 18,32,23,13,16), so I use recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduce new replenishment. L default keeps promised 0 (matches observed). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the current low-variance regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods; recent demand (Periods 35-40: 18,32,23,13,16,15) is lower and stable versus earlier spikes. On-hand=122, in-transit=0 so we can be conservative and base demand forecast on the recent low regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent low-variance demand regime and avoid overstocking from older spike periods. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting a forecast reflective of current demand while keeping safety buffer from sigma_hat.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been low and stable (~15 units/week over last 6 periods). On-hand=107, in-transit=0 so current inventory already covers several weeks of demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use defaults: rely on promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates so the OR engine computes a base-stock that reflects long-run demand and the high current on-hand will suppress ordering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand is low/moderate (most recent 5 demands: 13,16,15,15,35) and on-hand is high (176) with zero in-transit. Historical conclues confirm lead time = 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining high service (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95), I use a short recent-window forecast (5 periods) so the OR backend sets base-stock close to current low demand patterns and reduces new receipts. Methods: keep promised lead time (default); use recent 5-period demand for mu_hat and for sigma_hat to capture recent lower mean and volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09: recent weekly demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 35 (weeks 2019-10-07 onward) with demands: 18,32,23,13,16,15,15,35,6 (Periods 35-43). On-hand=170, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for one-week horizon but we must reflect the recent lower demand to avoid excess holding cost. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (N=9, Periods 35-43) to capture the lower mean and reduced volatility; this shrinks forecast and reduces orders, balancing service level vs holding cost given high on-hand. Parameters: L=default to use promised 0; mu_hat=same-period+lead forecast using recent 9-week mean; sigma_hat=std computed on same 9-week window.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=169, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply (Periods 42-44 demands = 35, 6, 1) suggesting a new low-demand regime; to avoid excess holding cost I use a short recent window. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (captures the latest low average). Set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect current low volatility. These choices reduce planned replenishment to prioritize holding-cost savings while keeping service given current low demand.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen sharply in Dec (last 5 demands: 15,35,6,1,9 \u2192 recent mean=13.2), so I downweight long-run high-spike periods and use a short recent window to avoid overstock. Set L via calculate to let backend confirm lead time=0 from history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and lower forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility, reducing ordering and holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

No overdue shipments; historical lead time has been consistently 0. To avoid overstock during this sustained low-demand December regime, set lead time to default (promised=0) and base demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low regime. Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and order cap accordingly given the December demand drop and high service-level weight (profit/holding \u2192 q\u22480.95).
