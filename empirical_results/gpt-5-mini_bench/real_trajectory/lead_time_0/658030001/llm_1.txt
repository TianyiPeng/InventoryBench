Historical demand: recent weekly samples show a clear uptick from 78 (2019-01-28) to 154 (2019-02-04). With no on-hand or in-transit stock at Period 1 (2019-02-11) we must cover immediate demand while avoiding heavy end-of-period holding cost (holding $1 equals profit $1). Lead time: supplier promised 0 but actual lead time is unknown; no conclude messages to infer lead time yet. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order is needed to meet demand this period. Final order logic: place a conservative order to capture most expected demand this week while limiting overstock risk given equal profit and holding cost. I choose 120 units\u2014below the recent peak (154) to reduce leftover risk but large enough to recover substantial sales if demand remains elevated.",
