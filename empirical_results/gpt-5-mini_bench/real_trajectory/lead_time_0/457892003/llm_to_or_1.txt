Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u224883.6 units/week and moderate variability (std \u224815.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0. No evidence of changepoint or delayed shipments. Use default methods so backend uses (1+L)*sample mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps L at the promised value (minimizes blind extension of lead time), and uses historical mean/volatility to balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u21d2 moderate fill target) against holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01 weekly series) have mean 83.6 units/week. On-hand=38, in-transit=0 and last period's order (P1) arrived with lead_time=0. No evidence of lost shipments or persistent lead-time drift. I choose default lead time to trust the promised 0; mu_hat default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline weekly demand); sigma_hat default to use overall sample volatility. These settings balance service (cover ~83.6 expected demand) vs holding cost given moderate holding penalty and current on-hand stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Jan 2019 weekly): [66,73,111,83,85]; recent actual weeks (Period1,2) demand = 61,64. Two concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1,P2 arrived P1,P2). No evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Use promised/default lead time=0 and default demand volatility/mean so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean; this balances service (use historic mean) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-3) shows orders placed arrived same period (lead_time=0 each), on-hand=15, in-transit=0. Demand history (samples from Jan 2019: mean=83.6) and stable same-period lead time support using default calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time. This keeps L at promised (0) since arrivals have been same-period, and uses default mu_hat/sigma_hat to balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to three-period-normal demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. On-hand=44, in-transit=0; recent sample mean demand = 83.6 units/week, std \u224815.3. With promised lead time 0 and confirmed arrivals same-period, use default lead time. Use default demand stats (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes base-stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. This raises order target to cover the current period's demand (mean \u224883.6) while letting OR engine trade service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20135) = [61,64,78,48,34] shows a downward shift in the last two periods; on-hand=56, in-transit=0, confirmed LT=0 in history. Use L=default (promised LT=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent lower mean (mean of last 5 = 57 units); with L=0 this targets ~57 units. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent regime while acknowledging zero lead time so orders replenish same period and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent concluded history shows lead time consistently 0 (P1\u2192P1 ... P6\u2192P6). On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (historical samples: weekly means ~83.6) shows moderate weekly demand; no sustained changepoint in March (weekly demands 61,64,78,48,34,42 fluctuate but not a sustained shift). Use default lead time (promised=0 confirmed) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level (using historical mean) vs holding cost given modest holding penalty ($1/unit).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical demands show a sustained downward shift beginning Period 4 (periods 4-7 demands = 48,34,42,32). Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To respond to the lower recent demand while preserving service, I set L to default (promised = 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean to the new lower regime (avg of Periods 4-7 = 39.0). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock vs. long-run mean, lowering holding cost while retaining adequate coverage for the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg decreased from 67.7 (Periods 1-3) to 39.0 (Periods 4-7), change = -42% (evidence: Periods 4-7 demands = 48,34,42,32).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-7 arrivals same-period). Demand regime dropped starting Period 4 (Periods 4-7: 48,34,42,32); use this recent low regime to set forecast. Set L=default (promised 0, confirmed). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the four most recent low-demand weeks, reducing inventory risk given holding cost and zero pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Observed lead time confirmed = 0 (concluded periods show arrivals same period). On-hand=21, in-transit=0; recent demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 4. I use recent data to capture the post-changepoint demand level: last 6 demands (P4\u2013P9 = 48,34,42,32,72,40) have mean \u224844.7 units ((1+L)*mean \u224844.7 with L=0) and sample std \u224814.6. Ordering to a base-stock calculated from recent demand will avoid overstocking from earlier high-demand samples while preserving service. Choices: L default to respect promised lead time and confirmed 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2192P1...P10\u2192P10). Demand regime dropped at Period 4 (carry-over): recent demand since Period 4 is lower than early-sample mean. On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment to cover (1+L) periods. I set L to default (promised/confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201310, 7 samples) to capture the lower mean; N=7 per regime_length rules. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent variability. These choices lower the target base-stock relative to early-sample default, reducing excess holding while preserving service given confirmed lower demand and zero lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P arrivals matched same-period orders). A sustained demand regime shift started at Period 4 (periods 4\u201311 demands = 48,34,42,32,72,40,24,50) \u2014 regime length = 8. To capture the lower recent mean and its volatility I use recent_N with N=8 for demand mean and std. Using L=default (promised 0) aligns with confirmed lead-time evidence. These choices steer the OR engine to a base-stock sized to recent lower-demand behavior while preserving service via observed volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-12) consistently show arrivals same-period; lead time confirmed as 0 in prior insight. No outstanding overdue shipments. Demand has shown a sustained lower regime since Period 4 but that insight is already recorded; no new sustained changepoint since last conclude. Use promised lead time (0) so OR backend uses recent observations consistently. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given modest on-hand inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2192P1,...P13\u2192P13). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4; recent 5-week mean (P9-P13 demands = 40,24,50,32,30) \u2248 35.2 units. To match current lower-demand regime while keeping service, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the last 5 weeks' lower average demand and reduce overstock risk. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock with observed lower demand and zero lead time so orders won't overbuild inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2192P1 ... P13\u2192P13; missing orders at P8 and P14 were single-period zeros, not a sustained lead-time change). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (carry-over insight): recent demands (Periods 10\u201314 = 24,50,32,30,24) average ~32 units. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) and use a recent_N estimate for demand to reflect the lower regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect current lower mean and observed variability. This balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by reducing forecasted (1+L)-period demand and tightening variability estimates.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand 24, in-transit 0. Historical concluded data show confirmed lead time = 0 and a persistent lower-demand regime starting Period 4 (Periods 4-15 show lower weekly demand vs Periods 1-3). I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently match promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 4-15) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the current low-demand regime while preserving service given same-period arrivals and minimizing holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4 (periods 4\u201316 show consistently lower weekly demand vs. Periods 1\u20133). On-hand=26, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals (lead time historically confirmed 0). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals in history confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (periods 4\u201316 form the current low-demand regime of length 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime (reduces overstocking while maintaining service). This balances profit vs holding cost by forecasting (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent variability for the OR engine.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4. I keep L as default (promised 0) because lead time has been confirmed as 0 in history. For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201317, stable lower mean); N=14 captures that regime length. I apply recent_N to both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility from the recent lower-demand regime, reducing excess inventory while maintaining service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4. Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 24,17,24,6,5) is much lower than early-season levels; to avoid excess holding cost given Profit=$4 / Holding=$1 (high service target but meaningful holding cost), I choose lead time=default (promised 0 confirmed by prior concludes) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the recent down-shift. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the base-stock responsive to the current low-demand regime and limits overstock risk while preserving service via the OR backend's z* logic.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent weekly demand has moved lower; last 5 demands = [17,24,6,5,15] (mean=13.4) so I down-weight long-run data to avoid overstock. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)*recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and keep orders conservative versus holding cost (profit=4, hold=1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has been low and stable over the last 4 concluded periods (P17\u2013P20 demands = 6,5,15,11; avg \u22489.25), so I use a short recent-N forecast to avoid overstock given Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1. Choose L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on recent_N N=4 to reflect the most recent low regime, and sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture recent variability. These parameters keep base-stock tight to balance service and holding cost given current low demand and no in-transit inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and there was a sustained demand drop from Period 4 onward (carry-over). Recent demand has been low (Periods 17-21: 6,5,15,11,8; recent regime clearly lower than early periods). Use promised lead time (default) to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals. For demand forecasts use recent_N over the current low-demand regime to avoid overstating mu: choose N=18 to cover the sustained post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201321) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean and volatility and keep inventory/leads low versus holding cost.

Recent demand has been low (Periods 18-22 demands = 5,5,15,11,8 -> recent average ~8.8), indicating the lower-demand regime persists; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (Periods 1-23 arrivals consistently same-period). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4; recent weeks show low demand with some variability (last 5 demands: 15,11,8,5,29). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and estimate demand from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime and recent variability. Therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets a base-stock tuned to the recent low-demand regime and measured volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 \u2014 retain promised lead time (default). Recent demand has been lower and variable; to capture latest regime and avoid excess holding I use a short recent window (last 5 weeks) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects current lower demand while still protecting service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0; recent demand has been lower than early periods but not a sustained new upward regime. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and use full historical demand for stable estimates, set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service level given profit $4 vs holding $1 while avoiding overreacting to recent fluctuations or isolated zeros.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals in prior periods). Demand experienced a sustained down-shift starting Period 4 (documented in carry-over), so I use a recent-sample forecast to reflect the current low-demand regime. No overdue shipments to account for. Set L=default to trust confirmed 0 lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current regime (last 10 observed demands) so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost given lower recent demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand is variable with a notable spike in Periods 26-27 (37,62) after many low weeks; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Lead time has long been confirmed as 0 (concluded history). I select L=default to use promised lead time (0). To capture recent uptick and short-term volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 demand samples to adapt the base-stock and safety stock to the latest regime). This balances service (responding to the recent spikes) versus holding cost by limiting lookback to recent data rather than all-time higher averages.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=4, in-transit=0; recent weeks show low-to-moderate demand with an intermittent spike (Period 27=62). Historical concluded lead times all =0, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime but remain responsive to short spikes, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 24-28) so the OR engine builds a base-stock reflecting current regime while allowing for recent variability. This balances service level (q high given profit/holding) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the older, higher-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=14, in-transit=0; recent weeks show lower, variable weekly demand since the regime shift at Period 4 (documented). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7) to capture the most recent demand regime and short-term volatility (balances service level vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent mean and variability rather than older higher-demand samples). N=7 captures one to two months of recent weekly demand to reflect current patterns while meeting the guidance on regime detection.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods P1\u2192P1 ... P30\u2192P30). Recent demand shows lower regime vs early periods; to reflect the latest demand pattern I use a recent window to set mu_hat so the base-stock targets recent demand while sigma uses default population variability. This keeps service high with minimal extra holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0; recent demand (last 5 periods) centers around ~41-53 units/week so I use a recent window to capture current regime. Set L=default to keep promised 0 (confirmed by history). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands so orders track the current demand level and avoid excess holding. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding large ending inventory given low pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2192P33). Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike in Period 33 (87) and elevated recent weeks (Periods 29-33 = 39,53,44,41,87). To balance service (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) I keep promised lead time (L=default) and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime while avoiding diluting with older low-demand periods. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and ensure safety stock scales with observed variability. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts this period while limiting excess holding given moderate holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so we have low coverage. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. To capture the recent higher demand regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (uses the last 8 demand samples); this raises the base stock toward current demand without overreacting to a single spike. No evidence of lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand is volatile with several high weeks (Periods 27,30,33,34,35) so I bias parameters to recent history to capture current regime and variability while keeping promised lead time. Choose L=default to use promised 0. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std from the last 20 demand samples, which balances higher service level (q=0.8) against holding cost by reflecting recent demand magnitude and volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201336 arrivals matched same period), so keep L=default (promised 0). Recent demand has risen vs the low-demand regime observed around Periods 4\u20137; last 6 concluded weekly demands (Periods 31\u201336 = 44,41,87,63,70,61) average \u224861 and show increased volatility. I choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets supply for the current higher-demand regime while keeping L default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time. This balances service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost by using a short, recent window rather than all-sample average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been volatile with several stockouts in Periods 30-37 (notably P33 demand=87, P35-37 high demand 70,61,91). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmations), so use promised lead time. To respond to the recent high/volatile demand and avoid lost sales, set demand forecast using the most recent short window: use recent_N=5 (captures P33\u2013P37 behavior) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the backend base-stock to protect service while the OR engine applies its cap to limit over-ordering given holding cost (Profit=$4, Holding=$1).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0; recent demand (Periods 34-38) has been elevated (63,70,61,91,69). To balance service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand and recent high demand) against holding cost, I use a short recent window to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend raises the base stock toward the recent higher mean while keeping lead time = promised (0). No evidence of new lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:

Historical data shows confirmed LT=0 (Periods 1-39 conclude messages) and recent elevated demand in Sep\u2013Nov (Periods 35-39 demands = 70,61,91,69,72; avg \u224872.6). To prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and respond to the recent higher-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 weeks to capture current mean/volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201340 arrivals all same-period). Recent demand has risen (Periods 36\u201340 demands = 61,91,69,72,59) reflecting late-year higher sales. To balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost I use promised lead time (default L=0) and a short recent window to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N using last 5 samples to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean \u224870.4 units, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect elevated volatility. These parameters raise base-stock to meet strong recent demand while limiting excess holding given confirmed L=0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows confirmed lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201341 arrivals all same-period). Recent demand (Periods 30\u201341) exhibits a sustained higher regime (12 weeks from P30 to P41) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 samples to capture current mean and volatility. Using L=default (promised lead time = 0) leverages confirmed arrivals. This ensures the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet the current higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety for variability; this balances service (profit $4/unit) versus $1 holding cost given limited on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for immediate demand. Recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 35-42 include multiple stockouts and a large spike: Period42 demand=118), indicating a late-season/Nov surge. No new sustained lead-time signals (previously confirmed L=0). I choose L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and holiday tail, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 (uses last 8 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Keep sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This biases orders up to meet the recent spike while letting OR engine compute service quantile based on profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many P arrivals same period). Recent demand (Periods 37-43) shows elevated demand vs earlier low-regime (periods 4-7): demands = [91,69,72,59,70,118,47], mean \u2248 73.7 and one large Black-Friday spike (118 on Period 42). To balance service (profit $4 vs hold $1 \u2192 higher target service level) I keep L as promised (confirmed=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 7 weeks to capture the late-year uptick and higher volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock and cap to avoid stockouts during the holiday spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0) and no new sustained demand regime change since prior insight. Given recent high variability around Nov\u2013Dec but no 3+ period sustained new regime, use default estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this balances service vs holding cost while relying on confirmed lead time=0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (period 46). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show lead time reliably 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent weeks (Periods 42-45) show elevated demand (118,47,68,67) consistent with holiday-season lift; I therefore focus forecasting on the most recent 5 weeks to capture this spike. Set L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to make (1+L)\xd7mean reflect the last-5-week elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This balances higher service level for holiday demand while avoiding excessive long-term holding costs once season ends.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Context: Year-end/holiday week \u2014 recent weeks (Periods ~33-46) show elevated and volatile demand (several stockouts and large orders). Current on-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Previous carry-over confirmed lead time=0 and a demand drop earlier in the year, but recent months show higher demand so use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with long run confirmed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent demand level and volatility (captures holiday uplift and recent stockouts) so the OR engine raises base-stock to protect service while capping orders to limit overstock given holding cost.
