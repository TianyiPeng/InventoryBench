Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward regime beginning 2019-01-21 (22, 71, 102) vs prior low weeks (2,1). I treat lead time as promised (default) because no arrival history is available. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21 through 2019-02-04). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend will order more to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 65.0 (22,71,102) vs prior period avg = 1.5 (2,1); sustained increase over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Period-1 conclude shows the P1 order arrived in P1 (lead_time=0) so actual lead time aligns with promised 0; set L via calculate to confirm. Demand exhibits a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3 samples 22,71,102) so set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher short-run mean across the review+lead period. Volatility is best estimated from the same recent regime, so set sigma_hat recent_N N=3. These choices bias orders upward to cover the new higher demand while reflecting observed lead time and limiting excess holding given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand shows a clear regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples (22,71,102) average 65 vs prior avg ~1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for orders in Periods 1\u20132. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the three most recent weeks), which raises base-stock to meet the sustained uplift while limiting extra holding from older low-demand data.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all recent orders arrived same-period (observed lead_times = 0), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand shows elevated regime over last 3 periods (demands 86,118,55); use recent_N=3 to capture current mean/volatility for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances higher service level for the sustained demand uptick while limiting holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (higher weekly demand vs Jan lows). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period. On-hand=58, in-transit=0. I set L to calculated average observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (uses the most recent 3 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand without being overly influenced by low Jan values. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward meeting the new demand regime while keeping holding cost in check given on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand elevated vs earlier regime (recent 5 demands: 86,118,55,55,49 \u2192 mean\u224872.6), so set demand forecast using recent data to capture the sustained higher regime. Use recent_N N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling uses current lead time and recent mean/volatility; this balances higher service level given profit$4 vs holding$1 while avoiding overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (high weekly sales) but last 6 weeks show moderation (demands: 86,118,55,55,49,25). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. On-hand=73, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus replenish to target high service level (profit/holding -> q=0.8). I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-changepoint regime but reflect the recent downward trend. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices push the OR engine to a high service quantile (appropriate given profit>holding) while avoiding overstock from older high outlier weeks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (recent 5-period demands = 55,55,49,25,55 \u2192 mean \u2248 47.8) compared to earlier low-volume samples. On-hand=38, in-transit=0; historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently, so no overdue shipments. I choose L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (reduces influence of very early low samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for current elevated demand while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent experience, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher recent demand); to capture the current elevated mean and volatility, use recent_N with N=3 (most recent high-demand weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases base_stock toward recent higher demand while keeping lead-time estimate data-driven.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=27, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0). Demand has moderated recently vs initial surge. Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 (last 5 periods' demand=25,55,61,37,35 -> recent mean ~42.6) so mu_hat reflects the recent lower regime and limits overstock given holding cost. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings balance service (capture current demand level) against holding cost with profit=4/hold=1 implying a high service quantile but we constrain to recent demand.

Demand recently moderated vs the early Jan spike; last 5 demand observations (Periods 7-11) show a lower recent mean and volatility, so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime. This keeps (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the recent lower demand while the OR backend will compute a high service-level base stock (profit/holding = 4) balanced by recent demand/std inputs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent zero actual lead time (orders repeatedly arrived same period). Demand has shown a sustained regime increase since 2019-01-21 (earlier insight). Recent weeks show variable demand; to capture recent demand level while being responsive to regime shift I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. Using default lead time (promised 0) aligns with observed arrivals. These parameters provide the OR engine a recent-demand-based base stock while keeping lead-time assumption consistent with observed behavior and limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed lead_times = 0 (orders arriving same period), so use calculated lead time (avg observed = 0). Demand history shows the earlier sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher mean); overall sample set provided will be used by backend default demand aggregation. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). SKU 639448001 has on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P14 arrived same period), so use calculate to let backend confirm actual lead time. Recent demand (Periods 12\u201314 = 50, 44, 45) is the most relevant regime for near-term forecasting; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This keeps inventory aligned with the recent demand level while avoiding overstating variability from early-season spikes. No in-transit arrivals expected to show up until a future conclude message; ordering will top up from on-hand to the computed base stock given these estimates.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows elevated rates over last 3 weeks (44,45,60) vs older low-sample periods; lead times historically concluded as 0. To react quickly to the recent higher regime while avoiding excess holding, use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand pattern. L kept as default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times uniformly 0 (all arrived messages show lead_time=0); no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 but subsequent weekly demands (20\u201360s) are stable enough to use full-sample stats. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed reliable same-day arrivals and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base-stock from all samples; this balances service (using full history) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=45, in-transit=0, no overdue or missing arrivals in concluded history; all observed lead_times = 0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P13-P17) = [44,45,60,28,29], mean=41.2 \u2014 use this recent sample to capture current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead time (confirmed 0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This raises service level to match high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.8) while avoiding excess stock given on-hand=45 and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded lead_times=0). Keep L as promised (default). Demand shows a past regime jump (not repeated here), but recent weeks have varied; to weight recent weeks more while retaining history, use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3 so the forecast adapts to recent demand. Volatility will use default (all-sample) scaling for sigma_hat. This balances service (responsive mu_hat) vs holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

L set to average observed lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=8 to capture current demand level and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock for current demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent realized demand is low and stable (last several periods: 4,6,5,7,4,6,5...), on-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical early-2019 spike exists but demand has reverted to a lower regime for many periods. Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast and volatility focus on the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstocking: use recent_N=6 (captures approx. last 6 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant samples. This reduces holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

On-hand=28, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for a few weeks at current demand but avoid excess inventory given holding cost. Observed lead times in conclude history have been 0 consistently, so use default promised L. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-volume regime (reduces forecast vs. long-run mean). For volatility use recent_N (N=3) to reflect current low variability. These parameters bias orders toward lower base-stock and lower cap, balancing service with holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 19-25 demands = 4,6,5,7,5,5,10; recent 7-period mean \u2248 6). On-hand=13, in-transit=0; with promised lead time default=0, current on-hand covers ~2 periods at recent demand. I set L to default (use promised lead time=0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the recent low/stable regime and reduce influence of the early high spike. This keeps target base-stock small to limit holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent conclude history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0; however supplier has sent no new orders since Period 18 (many periods with ordered=0) so pipeline is empty. No new sustained demand regime change detected since earlier spike in Jan\u2013Feb (carry-over already recorded). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std. This balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain supplier activity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders placed in each concluded period arrived same period) \u2014 no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demands since Period 1 include a sustained regime shift early in the series but no new sustained change since the last insight. Given stable observed lead time and no new demand regime, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0,in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently so use promised lead time. Recent demand (last ~5 periods: 5,10,24,62,53 arrivals and demands showing volatility and recent spikes) suggests using recent_N to capture current regime for demand mean and volatility. No clear new sustained structural shift beyond the previously recorded Jan spike, so do not create a new carry-over insight. These choices let the OR backend target service with updated short-run mean/variance while respecting promised lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear surge starting Period 27 (2019-08-12): demands P27-29 = 52, 69, 106 (3-period avg=75.67) vs prior 6-period avg (P21-26)=9.33. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0). I set L=default to keep promised lead time=0. To react quickly to the recent sustained demand increase, I use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat so the backend targets the new higher mean (1+L)*mean over the last 3 weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover the new regime while keeping lead-time assumption consistent with observed concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg increased from 9.33 (P21-26) to 75.67 (P27-29) (+712%), sustained over 3 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 27: recent demands (P27-P30) = [52,69,106,84], a sustained higher regime vs prior low-volume weeks. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To capture the new higher demand level, set mu_hat using a recent_N over the most recent regime (N=4). Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect current variability. Keeping L=default (promised 0) avoids overestimating lead time given consistent concluded 0-period arrivals. This biases orders toward meeting the elevated demand while the backend's cap limits prevent extreme over-ordering, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

No overdue arrivals. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because all concluded arrivals show 0 lead time consistently. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent window.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 27 (ongoing through Period 33) \u2014 recent demands (P27\u2013P33): 52,69,106,84,87,68,149 with elevated mean vs prior low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) periods of demand. Lead time observations from concluded periods are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent elevated regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 concluded demand samples (regime length P27\u2013P33 = 7) so the OR engine will size base stock to the new mean and volatility while keeping cap restrictions. This balances service (reduce stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by relying on recent-regime statistics rather than long-run averages.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 0 (all concluded arrivals labeled 0), so use default L. Recent demand remains in a higher regime (previously recorded shifts at P1 and P30); latest 5 realized weekly demands (P30-P34 = 84,87,68,149,78) average ~93.2. On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so we should target the recent elevated demand level to avoid stockouts while balancing $1 holding cost. Therefore set mu_hat based on the recent 5-week mean (recent_N N=5) and set sigma_hat from the same recent 5 samples to reflect current volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 27 (weeks 27\u201337 demand elevated and volatile). Current on-hand=38, in-transit=0 \u2014 limited cover for another high-demand week, so we must forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Set L to promised (default=0) since all concluded lead times are 0. Use recent_N (N=11, Periods 27\u201337) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime's mean and volatility over the 11-period high-demand window; this balances service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost by not mixing with older low-demand data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history (Periods 34-38 demands = 78,70,64,68,90) remains in the higher-demand regime first identified around Period 27; no new sustained changepoint since previous carry-over insights. On-hand=14, in-transit=0, so pipeline is empty. Keep promised lead time (L=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (recent mean \u224874 units/week). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices provide the OR engine a forecast focused on the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes; using recent_N reduces stockouts given empty pipeline while controlling holding cost by limiting horizon to recent data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=6, in-transit=0, no recent missing arrivals; historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated weekly demand through Period 39, regime length=13). To reflect the sustained higher demand and recent variability, keep L as promised (default) and use recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand stats from the 13-week high-demand regime, balancing service level (capture elevated mean) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use default promised L. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated demand through Period 40); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus on the post-change regime (N=14, periods 27\u201340) so the base-stock reflects the new higher mean and volatility while avoiding dilution from pre-shift low demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show promised lead time=0 consistently (many periods with arrived=ordered and lead_time=0); no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. A major demand regime shift occurred earlier (Periods ~21-30) but demand since Period 30 has been stable without a new sustained change. To let the OR engine use its full historical estimates and its cap calculation, I choose default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base_stock from all samples and promised L=0. This balances service level (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a large demand spike in Period 42 (221 units) after typical weekly demands ~50\u201390; to be responsive this period I bias forecasts toward the most recent regime. I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last 3 weeks) so the OR backend will target safety/stock appropriate for the recent high demand while keeping calculation simple. This balances service (avoid stockout after the P42 spike) against holding cost given limited inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=176, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history show arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Demand history shows past sustained regime shifts already recorded (summer spike starting P27 and earlier Jan shift) but recent weeks include a one-off Black Friday spike (P42=221) followed by low demand; no new sustained change detected. To avoid overreacting to the transient spike and given high on-hand, use default forecasting (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding costs conservatively.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=162, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 when orders arrived; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 40-44) = [59,78,221,18,14], indicating elevated short-run mean driven by a large spike (Period 42) but still higher recent average than long-run. To respond quickly to current observed demand regime while avoiding excess holding, keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the latest 5-week demand pattern (capturing the spike and recent lower weeks) and the corresponding short-run volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=138, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded messages, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (P42-P45 = 221,18,14,24) shows a large outlier (P42) then three low weeks; no new sustained regime change (needs \u22653 consistent periods). To keep responsiveness to the recent mix of high variability while emphasizing recent weeks, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (uses P42-P45). This biases the forecast toward the near-term sample mix and lets the OR backend compute base stock balancing profit vs holding cost. No new confirmed lead-time or regime changes to carry forward.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=150, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all observed orders arrived same-period (observed lead_time=0 in conclude messages across history), so actual lead time is 0. No new sustained demand regime change since prior recorded shifts (Jan and Period 27/30 spikes); recent large single-week spike (Period 42 demand=221) appears event-driven, not a sustained new regime. To balance high service-level target (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) with significant existing on-hand stock, use lead time averaged from observations and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses full historical mean/std scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to one-off spikes while keeping availability high.
