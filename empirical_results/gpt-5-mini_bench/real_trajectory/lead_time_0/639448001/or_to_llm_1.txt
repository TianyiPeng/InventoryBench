Given profit=$4 and holding=$1 the optimal service fractile is high (q=0.8) but OR's cap has limited ordering. Because the last two weeks' average is 86.5 and the most recent week is 102, I increase OR's recommendation to cover near-term demand and a modest safety buffer while avoiding excessive holding cost.
