Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly history (5 samples from Jan\u2013early Feb) shows stable mean ~134 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or overdue shipments to infer lead-time. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (cover typical weekly demand) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (Jan\u2013early Feb) show weekly demands ~133 mean; Period 1 demand was 101 and left on-hand=44 with no in-transit. Promised lead time = 0 and Period 1 order arrived same period, so using default lead time. To let the OR backend apply its historical demand stats consistently and avoid overfitting from a single lower recent demand (101), I choose default methods: L=default (use promised), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level versus holding by relying on the long-run sample mean/variance while acknowledging current on-hand=44 and no pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Two concluded arrivals (P1 and P2) show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1/P2 arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand caused a stockout (demand 156 in P2). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead_time=0 from history. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), providing a baseline forecast while the confirmed lead time is 0. This balances service (avoid further stockouts) against holding cost given limited history of a single higher demand draw.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived in the same period \u2192 actual lead time = 0 consistently. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms lead time=0 from observed arrivals. Demand historical samples (Jan weekly series) will be used by backend as baseline, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a base-stock reflecting those samples while keeping safety stock modest given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $519.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and no in-transit stock; on-hand=21. Historical weekly demand samples (133,141,138,144,112) have no clear changepoint; use default lead time and demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/SD. This balances service (use mean demand) with holding cost given moderate profit:holding ratio (q=0.8) and confirmed L=0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) averaged ~140.4 units/week with visible spike in P2-P3; on-hand=15, in-transit=0 so we remain exposed to stockouts given recent demand. Lead time confirmed short/instant historically, so use promised lead time (default). Forecast (mu_hat) based on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current higher regime (recent_N N=5). Volatility (sigma_hat) also estimated from the last 5 periods to reflect recent variability and let the OR engine set service level vs holding cost accordingly.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded weekly demand (Periods 1-6) = [101,156,170,135,140,175] (mean \u2248146). No overdue or missing shipments observed; prior carry-over confirmed lead time=0. Choose L=default (use promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent six weeks (captures the elevated recent demand vs. Jan samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind given holding/profit ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent weekly demand has been elevated: last 5 demands = [170,135,140,175,173], mean \u2248158.6, std \u224819.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and historical conclude messages consistently show 0-period lead time. I set L by calculating the average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (keeps orders responsive to current trend). Sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters instruct the OR engine to target a base-stock around the recent mean demand while accounting for observed variability, balancing service (profit $4) vs holding cost $1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $555.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (period demands: 101,156,170,135,140,175,173,146) with on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals every period), so use promised/default L=0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (use the last 8 demand samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting current demand and variability. This balances service (responding to higher recent demand) against holding cost by basing parameters on the full recent regime rather than older low-variance samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows reliable same-day arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in prior carry-over). On-hand=60, in-transit=0; typical weekly demand (historic samples mean ~133.6) implies on-hand covers ~0.45 weeks. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), providing a balanced base-stock given profit=4 vs holding=1 and no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. No new overdue shipments detected.

Recent demand shows volatility but no sustained regime change (last periods: 146,111,77 \u2014 short dip). To be conservative and leverage full sample set, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical data for base-stock sizing while respecting low lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 0 (orders always arrived same period). Demand history available; no recent sustained demand regime change. To balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) and given confirmed L=0, use default demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time. This keeps service high while letting backend cap orders to control inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~136 units (samples: 133,141,138,144,112 and many subsequent weekly demands in history), and concluded periods 1\u201313 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0). Current on-hand=62, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed lead time 0 and stable demand regime, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/STD. This balances service (use historical mean+safety) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently (confirmed earlier). No evidence of demand regime shift; recent weeks' demands hover near historical mean. Use default lead time to match promised/observed behavior and default demand/volatility (uses all samples) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps orders aligned with observed weekly demand and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while balancing profit vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=95, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals and past conclude messages confirm actual lead time=0. Recent demand (Periods 13-17 = 97,99,96,89,58) shows a sustained lower regime vs. earlier samples (~133-144). To reflect current demand regime I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by history), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast using the last 5 periods (captures downshift), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to estimate recent volatility. This reduces excess ordering vs. older higher-demand data while the OR backend will compute base_stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13-17: recent avg = 87.8 (Periods 13-17), earlier sample avg = 133.6 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04); sustained drop over 5 periods (~-34%)

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has shifted down vs. historical 2019 Jan-Feb samples: sustained lower regime detected around Periods 13-17 (avg ~87.8) and Period 18 demand remained low (41). On-hand=62, in-transit=0; with lead time confirmed = 0 in prior concludes, arrivals are same-period but none are currently inbound. To avoid overstock given $4 profit/$1 holding and the confirmed lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the most recent 5-week regime (Periods 14-18), matching the detected changepoint length and keeping orders responsive to the new lower mean while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1-19). Demand has shifted down vs. original sample: recent regime (Periods 13-17) avg \u224887.8 vs earlier overall mean 133.6 (sustained ~-34% over 5 periods). To reflect the lower recent demand I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by history) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new lower regime (captures current demand level and recent variance), which reduces overstock risk while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand is well below the early-sample mean (sustained drop since Period 13). On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock; promised lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0. To reflect the lower recent regime, set lead time to default (promised 0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime (last 8 periods, P13-P20) so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent mean and variance rather than the historical high winter mean. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service via the backend's service-level z* calculation (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime (Periods 17-21 avg \u224851.6/week). On-hand=46, in-transit=0\u2014no overdue shipments. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower regime (Periods 17-21 mean=51.6). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the new lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for current observed demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has remained well below the early-2019 baseline: recent weekly sales (P17-P22) average ~49 units vs historical sample mean ~133. On-hand=26, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1..P22). To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit, I set lead time to default (promised 0). I forecast demand using a recent-window mean to capture the sustained lower regime and reduce target base-stock; I select N=10 to cover the recent low-demand regime (periods since changepoint) while keeping the sample size \u22653. Volatility will use the same recent window to reflect reduced variability in recent weeks. These choices lower mu_hat and sigma_hat compared with long-run averages, reducing orders and holding cost while preserving service given the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Demand has fallen sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19-23) = [66,44,49,35,24], recent avg=43.6 vs earlier regime avg=87.8 (P13-17). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect current low-demand regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps target base stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service given current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19-23: recent avg = 43.6 (Periods 19-23) vs prior recent avg = 87.8 (Periods 13-17); sustained drop over 5 periods (~-50%).

Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 19 (Periods 19-24 demands = 66,44,49,35,24,27; recent avg \u2248 40.8). On-hand=38, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline and current stock cover ~0.9 weeks at recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (captures last 6 weeks including Periods 19-24). This keeps target base stock small to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders arriving same period). Demand has clearly shifted down: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21-25) = [49,35,24,27,13], recent mean \u224829.6 vs earlier regimes much higher. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service for the current demand level. No evidence of lost shipments to account for.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime (Periods 19-26: weekly demand mostly 13\u201366, recent avg \u2248 ~30s). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 \u2014 adequate buffer for one week but low inventory vs usual. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded messages; no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 19\u201326) to capture the sustained low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent lower variability. These choices reduce target base stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for current low-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Demand has fallen through multiple regime shifts; recent five concluded demands (Periods 23-27) = [24,27,13,13,17] => recent avg \u2248 18.8. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples (captures the latest lower-demand regime and reduced volatility). This biases orders down to match the sustained lower demand and reduces holding costs given profit=$4 / holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled at a lower regime: last 5 demands (Periods 24-28) = [27,13,13,17,15], recent avg=17 units/week (~-50% vs prior recent). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I select L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (N=5 chosen because the recent regime length=5). This keeps the base-stock small to limit holding cost while matching recent demand patterns and avoids over-ordering given no in-transit stock and confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 19; last 11 concluded demands (P19-P29) average ~29 units/week. To align orders with the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding cost, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (captures the current low-demand regime length) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from the most relevant recent data, reducing overstocking risk while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has settled at a low regime: last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 26-30) = [13,17,15,16,24], mean=17.0. On-hand=20, in-transit=0, so current inventory covers ~1 week at this demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability and avoid inflating safety stock from older, higher-variance history. This keeps base stock aligned with the sustained low demand and limits holding cost while maintaining service for immediate demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 keep promised lead time. Demand has dropped materially and sustained since Period 25\u201331; to capture the recent low regime use recent data for forecast and volatility. Chose L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period deliveries. Chose mu_hat recent_N (N=7) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent 7 demand observations (Periods 25\u201331) so OR backend targets service with lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing holding cost while preserving sales given low demand. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25-31: recent avg = 15.6 (Periods 25-31) vs prior recent avg = 43.6 (Periods 19-23); sustained drop over 7 periods (~-64%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Observed sustained low-demand regime: Periods 25-31 avg \u224815.6 units (vs prior regimes much higher). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals each period match same-period orders). On-hand=13, in-transit=0; with promised L=0 and current low demand, keep lead time at default (promised). Use recent_N for demand to capture the new low regime: choose N=7 (Periods 25-31) so mu_hat reflects the most recent 7-week low-demand pattern and sigma_hat uses the same window to reflect current volatility. This reduces target base_stock and caps ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the low-demand regime.

Demand has been in the low regime established in Periods 25-31 (avg ~15.6) and recent weeks (Periods 30-33) remain similar. To align the OR base-stock with the recent low-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime length=7 from Periods 25-31). This keeps forecasts responsive to the sustained low-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost given high holding relative to profit.

Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 31-35) = [11,7,18,5,4], recent average \u22489 units. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the latest low-demand regime and keep orders small. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent low volatility.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand has been low recently; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current low-demand regime (last 7 demand observations) so the OR engine targets a smaller base_stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (many periods). Recent demand (Periods 33-37) = [18,5,4,9,3], recent avg=7.8, showing a sustained low-demand regime over 5 periods following prior regime avg=15.6 (Periods 25-31). I set L to default (promised lead time 0, confirmed). I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the latest low regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent reduced variability. These choices reduce future ordering to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the observed low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33-37: recent avg = 7.8 (Periods 33-37) vs prior recent avg = 15.6 (Periods 25-31); sustained drop over 5 periods (~-50%).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across periods). Demand has undergone sustained downward shifts; most recent regime (Periods 33-37) shows very low demand (avg \u2248 7.8 over 5 weeks). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory already covers ~2 weeks at recent rates. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime. Selected methods: L=default (use promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the 5-period low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability. This reduces target base-stock and caps orders to limit overstock risk given the clear multi-period demand decline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time evidence: arrivals consistently conclude as 0 (confirmed in past history). Demand has undergone sustained downward regime shifts, most recently low-demand regime from Periods 33-39 (avg ~7.8 over P33-37, P38-39 also very low). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; with promised L=0 we only need to cover one period of demand. I use a recent_N demand estimate focused on the most recent low-demand regime (N=7 covering P33-39) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low mean/variability. L set to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals show lead time=0. This keeps target base-stock small to avoid holding cost while preserving service for the current low demand level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand has settled at a low regime: last 8 concluded weekly demands (Periods 33-40) = [18,5,4,9,3,1,4,1], avg \u22485.6/day. On-hand=11, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time historically confirmed 0. To avoid excess holding while preserving service at current low demand, use promised lead time and base demand forecast from the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) to reflect the sustained drop. Chosen: L=default uses promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to scale forecast to (1+L) periods using recent low-average; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This tight, recent-based estimate reduces overstock risk given holding cost >0 and low observed demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1..P41), so use promised lead time. Demand has fallen sharply through multiple regime shifts; most recent 4 concluded periods (P38-41) show demands [1,4,1,1], avg=1.75, which is a sustained low-demand regime (4 periods). To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0), forecast demand using the recent 4-period mean (mu_hat recent_N N=4) and set sigma to recent volatility (sigma_hat recent_N N=4). This keeps orders small and responsive given 0 lead time and the confirmed low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38-41: recent avg = 1.75 (Periods 38-41) vs prior recent avg = 7.8 (Periods 33-37); sustained drop over 4 periods (~-78%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has been in the low single-digits with a one-period spike (Period 42=15) after a sustained multi-period decline recorded through Period 42. No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must forecast for immediate demand. I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (confirmed historically). For demand I use recent_N (N=5: Periods 38-42) to capture the new low-demand regime while allowing the Period 42 spike to influence safety via sigma. mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of those 5 recent samples (mean=4.4). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of those 5 samples (std\u22485.43). This keeps target base-stock low to limit holding cost while retaining some buffer for the observed spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in history and carry-over). Demand has undergone multiple sustained downshifts; the most recent low-demand regime is best represented by the last 5 periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid diluting with much larger historical values. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility around this low-demand regime. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders, limiting holding costs while preserving service for the now-low demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has undergone multiple sustained downward regime shifts; current on-hand=8, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To avoid excess holding on a low-demand SKU, forecast demand using the most recent observations: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest low-demand regime while keeping responsiveness. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (including the small spike at P42) rather than long-ago high-variance history. These settings bias the OR engine toward a low base stock and cap, reducing overstock risk while preserving service for small ongoing demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent demand has fallen sharply and stabilized at very low levels since Period 42 (demands: 15,2,2,5). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; low service requirement and holding cost suggests minimal replenishment. Confirmed lead time historically = 0 (consistent arrivals). I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent low-demand regime ((15+2+2+5)/4\u22486) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent reflects current demand. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect low recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap orders, minimizing holding cost while matching current weak demand.

Demand has fallen and remained very low in recent weeks (Periods 43-46: 2,2,5,1; Period 42 spike=15 likely inventory-driven). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set lead time to promised (default) and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods (captures current low regime).
