Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history (Periods 1\u201346) shows arrivals same-period => actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Inventory: on-hand=6, in-transit=0 so available now=6. Recent demand: Periods 43\u201346 demands = 3,4,6,6 (avg \u22484.75); longer recent low regime already recorded (Period 34 insight). OR's recommendation (115) is driven by older higher-demand history and promised lead time assumptions and is not aligned with current low demand and confirmed 0 lead time. With L=0 we only need to cover the upcoming single period demand after decision; expected next-period demand \u22485 (rounded from recent avg). On-hand 6 already covers that. Ordering would add holding cost ($1/unit/period) while risking overstock; profit per unit is high but demand currently low and sustained. Therefore place 0 units order to avoid unnecessary holding cost and excess inventory while preserving ability to respond next period (lead time 0 allows same-period replenishment).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reject OR's 115 \u2014 confirmed lead time 0 and recent sustained low demand (avg \u22484.8 over last 4 periods); on-hand 6 covers next-period demand, so order 0 to avoid holding cost.",
