Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=50.2, std\u224818.11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Profit and holding cost equal (q=0.5) so no service-bias. With limited history and no evidence of changepoint or delayed shipments, use promised lead time and default demand estimates: L default (promised), mu_hat default (uses full-sample mean scaled by 1+L), sigma_hat default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This keeps the OR engine aligned with available data and avoids overreacting to noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Observed actual lead times: two concluded orders both arrived with 0-period lead time. Recent demand showed a short spike (61 then 130) but historical sample mean is 50.2 and spike is not yet a sustained regime change (needs 3+ periods). To remain conservative and aligned with observed lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand and volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine uses the long-run sample stats ((1+L)\xd7mean) while avoiding overreacting to a 2-period spike; this balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times for orders placed in Periods 1-3 were 0 periods, so I use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time=0. Demand shows a clear recent upward regime (Period 1-3 demands: 61, 130, 104) versus earlier historical samples (weekly mean \u224850). To capture the recent higher demand I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (focus on the three most recent demand observations). Volatility is set with recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to better cover the sustained demand increase while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0 to avoid over-forecasting pipeline needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (2019/2/11\u20132019/2/25): recent avg = 98.3 vs prior historical avg \u224850 (+96%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P4) shows arrivals = orders each period with observed lead_time = 0 consistently. Recent demand regime (Periods 2\u20134) elevated: demands = [130,104,86], recent mean \u2248106.7 (3 periods). To capture the confirmed regime shift while reflecting observed zero lead time, set L via calculate (avg observed lead_time=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base forecast on the 3-period high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock centered on the new higher mean (improves service during sustained higher demand) while sigma based on recent volatility prevents over/under-stocking given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime confirmed (sustained surge over 3 periods; recent avg \u224898.3 vs historical \u224850). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (no delays). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Use lead time estimated from observed lead times (calculate). Set demand forecast using the recent regime (recent_N, N=3) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the review+lead period. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture current volatility. This balances higher service level needed for elevated demand while avoiding excess holding since holding cost equals profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders show all observed lead times = 0, so use calculated lead time. Demand spike earlier (Periods 1-3) has passed; recent periods (Periods 4-6 demands = 86,85,79; avg \u224883.3) represent the current regime. To capture the current demand level and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (the three most recent periods). This avoids overstating demand based on the earlier short spike and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand has shifted up (notably high recent weeks including 179 in Period 7); to react to the higher recent mean while keeping variability measured, I set L to default (promised 0 periods). For demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 demand observations 104,86,85,79,179) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead window and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This raises target base stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma based on recent data prevents underestimating uncertainty.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 all arrived same period). Demand has stepped up since Period 4 (sustained higher demand across P4\u2013P8). I set L=calculate to confirm lead time from observed concludes (will be 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 5 periods P4\u2013P8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base stock and cap reflect the sustained uplift while limiting influence of older low-demand samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the new higher regime) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-15. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. Demand has been volatile but recent periods show a higher short-run mean; use recent_N (last 5 periods P5\u2013P9) to capture current regime (mean \u2248115.8) rather than long-run pre-shift samples. sigma_hat also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the backend base-stock to improve service during the recent higher-demand regime while sigma scaling preserves safety stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders ordered and arrived same period). A demand regime shift was previously confirmed starting 2019/2/11\u20132019/2/25 with sustained higher demand; recent periods (P4\u2013P10) remain in this higher regime. I set L to calculate to confirm actual lead time=0 from observed concludes. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (covering the 7 most recent periods since the detected regime shift) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility, helping the OR backend raise base-stock to meet higher demand while avoiding excessive holding given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand has been volatile with several large spikes (Periods 7,8,11). I will weight the last 5 weeks to capture the current higher/volatile regime when forecasting review+lead demand and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) ensures the base-stock reflects the recent elevated mean and variability; L=default keeps backend lead-time assumption aligned with observed concludes. No in-transit or on-hand stock, so this raises target order quantities to restore service while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). Recent demand has shown a sustained higher regime vs earlier historical samples, so I bias the forecast toward recent weeks. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed arrivals consistently 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest demand level over the most recent 5 periods and reduce influence of older low-demand samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while keeping inventory risk moderated by using a 5-period window.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand remains in the elevated regime noted in carry-over (Periods 4\u201313). I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (Period 11\u201313 demands: 160,128,117 => recent mean ~135) so mu_hat reflects current higher demand and avoids understock. Sigma set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run lower variance, which helps the OR backend size safety stock appropriately given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand remains elevated vs early history: last 4 concluded demands = [160,128,117,150] (avg ~139). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current period. Observed lead-times have been consistently 0 in concluded history \u2192 use default promised L=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime (confirmed earlier at Period 4) I use recent_N for demand estimates, taking N=8 to cover the full post-changepoint regime while smoothing short wiggles. Sigma estimated from same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to protect service while keeping holding cost in mind given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculated lead time=0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained through Period 15); to capture the persistent elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (regime length from P4\u2013P15). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean and appropriate volatility, improving service while acknowledging holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 4 and sustained, but signals are already captured in the history the OR backend will use. To remain consistent and let the OR engine compute base stock from full-history stats (while honoring observed L=0), I choose default methods for L, mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses promised lead time and full-sample mean/std across (1+L) periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders arriving same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows elevated and variable weekly demand (recent weeks demand ~90\u2013150) but no new 3+-period sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded Feb shift. To balance service vs holding cost with symmetric profit=holding ($1/$1) use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine set the safety stock via its q-formula.

Demand has stayed at an elevated regime since Period 4; to capture the current demand level I use a recent window. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect the last 5 weeks' mean demand (~119 units) and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This biases the base-stock toward current higher demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=53, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L via calculate (average observed). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4; to capture recent sales patterns I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (focus on last 5 weeks of realized demand to reflect current demand level ~100 units/week). This raises the base-stock to meet service while sigma based on recent volatility limits excess holding given holding cost = profit.

I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time = 0. To let the OR backend respond to the most recent demand regime (last ~8 weeks) I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current lower average demand and recent volatility, avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Recent demand has cooled since the Feb\u2013Mar spike; last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 17\u201321) show moderate demand. Choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed=0). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of the earlier Feb\u2013Mar spike; this targets service while limiting holding cost given current on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Demand has moderated since the early-year spike (carry-over insight from Period 4 remains). To reflect the recent demand regime (last several weeks) I use a recent_N estimate for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current lower-demand regime while keeping promised lead time. This balances service (capture current demand) vs holding costs given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has declined from the Feb spike; on-hand=43, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so use default lead time. To avoid overreacting to the Feb regime spike (recorded previously) I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (captures current lower summer demand). Thus: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=5 to reflect current lower mean demand (1+L times mean of last 5 samples). sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk from the earlier spike while preserving service for current demand.

Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend leverages full historical data and balances service level vs holding cost given current low pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has cooled versus spring: last 5 demands = {61,64,41,28,32}, mean \u224845.2. On-hand=57, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals or lost-shipment signals and historical concluded lead times have been 0. I choose L=default (promised 0). To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weeks). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward a lower base-stock (matching current demand) while preserving service by sizing safety stock from recent variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=15, in-transit=0, no arrivals expected this period. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed periods \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand has declined vs earlier weeks, so I base forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the lower regime and reduce excess holding. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps target inventory aligned with current demand and lowers holding costs.

Recent demand has been moderate with occasional spikes (last demands: 28,32,42,88); to react to recent level and variability I use recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to keep the forecast responsive while avoiding overreaction to a single spike. This balances service (capture recent demand uptick) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Recent weeks show lower and variable demand but no new sustained (>3 periods) regime shift since the previously recorded Feb demand spike. To keep the OR engine anchored to full historical evidence and avoid overreacting to short noise, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks) = [42,88,69,48,74], recent mean \u224864.2 which is below earlier peak but above long-run low; no confirmed lead-time shifts (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding= $1, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and base recent demand forecasting on the last 5 weeks to capture the current lower-volatility regime while keeping responsiveness. Therefore: L=default, mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)*recent mean demand, and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders closely tied to current observed demand and avoids overstock given low on-hand and zero in-transit.

Recent demand shows no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Feb shift; use population statistics to smooth variability. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (critical ratio 0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show orders arriving same period (observed lead times = 0), so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P28\u2013P32 demands = 69,48,74,83,50) suggests current regime mean ~65; use recent_N=5 to adapt mu_hat and sigma_hat to the latest demand level and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding overstock from older high-Feb spikes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet upcoming week demand. Recent demand (Periods 29-33) = [48,74,83,50,88], recent mean \u224868.6. No evidence of changed lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0 throughout), so use promised lead time. To quickly adapt to current demand regime while limiting holding cost, set L=default, mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the ~69 weekly demand, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This favors service while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Recent demand has varied but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Feb increase. To keep the OR backend calibrated to long-run demand statistics and because promised lead time is reliable, use default lead time and default demand estimates so base-stock reflects overall sample mean and variability. This balances service (using historical mean) against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) which implies q=0.5 (neutral).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), and the earlier demand regime shift (Periods 4\u20136) is already captured. Use default lead time to reflect consistent observed 0-period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods, so use promised lead time (default). No recent sustained demand regime change detected since the earlier Feb spike; recent weeks show moderate demand variability. To make the forecast responsive to current seasonality while smoothing noise, use a recent-window estimate (last 12 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent 12 samples. This balances service level and holding cost given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders always arrived same period). Recent demand (many weeks since the Feb/March regime shift) shows no new sustained change of at least 3 periods versus the long-run series. No overdue shipments. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand estimates, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to short fluctuations.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period so promised lead time remains valid. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201339 = 60,39,47,57,50) averages ~50.6 \u2014 no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Feb spike. To target current demand patterns and avoid excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks so the OR engine sizes orders to recent demand volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201340) shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (every concluded arrival indicates 0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage; no overdue/lost shipments. Demand history contains an earlier confirmed regime shift around Periods 2\u20134 (recorded previously) but demand since mid-year has reverted to typical weekly levels (~40\u201380). I choose default lead time to trust the repeatedly observed 0-period arrivals. For demand and volatility I select default methods so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, which balances service vs holding cost given stable recent patterns and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods across many periods, so use promised/default lead time. No strong recent demand regime change since the previously recorded Feb shift; use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in prior periods all arrived same period). Recent demand shows elevated volatility including a large spike (Period 42 demand=133). To capture the short-term elevated mean and volatility (holiday-season risk) I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to prioritize the most recent demand regime (captures the recent spike while smoothing over a few weeks). This raises the base-stock to protect service level during potential holiday demand, while sigma_hat recent estimate limits excessive overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (no evidence of delays). Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Feb demand shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with supplier promise and full historical demand, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine uses all samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps orders responsive to long-run demand while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16. On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P40\u2013P44) = [51, 38, 133, 43, 31] showing high variability with one large spike (133). No new sustained changepoint since prior Period 4 insight. Use promised lead time (default) because all concluded arrivals historically showed lead_time=0 and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current short-run mean including the recent spike; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed volatility. These choices make the OR backend set a base stock that responds to the recent higher variability while keeping L at the promised value to avoid overestimating pipeline needs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0. Recent demand has been volatile with a one-off large spike at Period 45 (204) but the last 5-week average is elevated (~89.8) versus long-run. I choose L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent elevated demand regime while avoiding overreacting to the single extreme older datapoints. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters raise target base stock to improve service after recent stockouts while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we currently have no coverage; recent concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0 (orders historically arrived same-period). There is a prior carry-over insight (Period 4) noting a sustained demand regime shift in Feb, but no new sustained changepoint in recent weeks (large Dec spikes are short-lived). Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost conservatively given no confirmed new regime.
