Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "History shows supplier actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (all concluded orders arrived same period they were ordered). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no inventory to meet Period 47 demand. Recent weeks show several large spikes (P42 demand=133, P45=204, P46=140) indicating elevated holiday-season demand; these spikes are recent and large enough that OR's baseline (81) \u2014 which smooths to historical averages \u2014 understates current demand. Profit=Holding so critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 OR's safety factor is minimal; given symmetric cost of over/under and recent high realized demand, I prioritize avoiding lost sales this week. Ordering 140 units matches the recent large realizations (P46=140, P45=204) and is enough to cover a high-demand week while not grossly overstocking relative to expected peak. Therefore I override OR and order 140 units to maximize sales this period while accepting holding cost risk.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "OR's 81 is too low given recent holiday spikes (P45=204, P46=140) and on-hand=0; order increased to 140 to cover likely high demand this week.",
