  "rationale": "Product: Womens belt (accessory) \u2014 likely stable fashion/occasion demand. Calendar: Period date 2019-02-11 is just before Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which can modestly boost accessory sales. Historical weekly demand (five samples through 2019-02-04): 74, 158, 220, 132, 107 \u2192 average = 138.2 units/week, moderate variability (range 74\u2013220). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 but actual lead time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time or lost orders. Decision logic: need to cover current-period demand (occurs after decision) plus be slightly conservative for a potential Valentine bump and lead-time uncertainty. Holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19, so bias toward slightly higher service level. Order placed now will arrive according to supplier actual lead time (may be 0 or >0); with no confirmed delays, ordering roughly one period of expected demand plus safety is appropriate. Action: order 150 units (\u22481.1\xd7 historical mean) to meet expected demand this period and modest holiday uplift while keeping holding costs small.",
